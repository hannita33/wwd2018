September 8, 2016	 The New York Post	  With polls showing the "vast majority of voters" dislike the two major candidates, how did they wind up as the nominees? The simple answer, writes Jay Cost at The Weekly Standard, is "that's democracy." In fact, it's "substantially more complicated" - because before voters get to decide, someone else selects the process. So dissatisfied voters "should blame the parties - and start demanding party reform." Indeed, the fact that it doesn't specify how to select candidates for office is "the gravest weakness of the Constitution." And "this election demonstrates that it is nearly impossible to produce good policy from a bad process."    Everett Piper, president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, explains at Heat Street why his school is "the first and only institution suing the Obama administration over its directives about how universities should address sexual harassment and assault." Those Title IX orders, he writes, "violate not only due process but also our students' basic constitutional rights." Instead of encouraging victims to go to police, "the Obama administration has mandated universities convene a committee of amateurs to look into allegations of sex crimes." Finally, the administration also is "requiring universities to conduct seminars on how to have consensual sex without legal consequence" - which violates the "unapologetically Christian" school's "beliefs and code of conduct."    With 512 homicides already recorded this year - more than in all of 2015 - Chicago is "experiencing a crisis of law and order," one that is "almost entirely self-inflicted," say the editors of National Review. Indeed, "Chicago is perhaps the most obvious example to date of the 'Ferguson Effect'," in which "police in minority neighborhoods have backed off interacting with residents when not absolutely necessary." But Mayor Rahm Emanuel "and the rest of Chicago's left-wing city government have only compounded the problem" by forming a task force that declared Chicago's police department racist and demanded "predictably ludicrous" accountability measures which he quickly adopted. Bottom line: "Chicago's leaders seem to be more interested in accommodating left-wing interest groups than in saving lives."    It's both "tragic and fitting that President Obama's latest failure to reach a cease-fire in Syria" took place in China, writes Eli Lake at Bloomberg View. Tragic, because Syria's death toll has now passed 400,000. But fitting, "because the rationale for Obama's reluctance to intervene in Syria goes back to a first-term strategy to pivot diplomatic attention and military hardware away from wars in the Middle East to the Asia-Pacific region." Yet even this has failed to curtail "Beijing's aggressive moves in the South China Sea to dredge up new islands and lay claim to the territorial waters of other US allies like the Philippines." Obama's failure to enforce his "red line" on Syria's use of chemical weapons "may also be the moment that China learned it could defy the US president and face no consequences."    Hillary Clinton's best hope is to accept that she's the establishment candidate, writes David Ignatius in The Washington Post. She "can't escape her mainstream pedigree," he says, and "she's not a convincing populist: The more she tries to sound like one, the more she risks coming off as a phony." Fact is, says Ignatius, Clinton's "current strategy, a sort of Bernie Sanders Lite, doesn't seem to be working very well" against outsider Donald Trump. Middle-class voters want to see a more robust economy and fairer distribution of economic growth. But Clinton "too often makes her agenda sound like a liberal laundry list." 
September 14, 2016	 The New York Post	  After 20 years, Colorado's unsolved 1996 killing of beauty queen JonBenét Ramsey, age 6, is grabbing more attention than Hillary's medical records. TV stations are glueing together assorted series.    Who did it? Family? Friend? Intruder? Pathologist/coroner Dr. Michael Baden, who consulted on the now-cold case, tells me: "It begat mistakes, theories, lawsuits, an arrest that produced nothing. DNA testing excluded the parents. So-called experts decided persons, now dead, did it. No one's alive to interrogate.     "I always believed it was someone in the household. Kidnappers don't spend 45 minutes writing multiple pages, which is what was found in this case. That's abnormal. Ransom requests get made out in advance. Killers don't wander around a kidnapping spot looking for a crayon. Also, it demanded exactly the precise amount of the father's just-received bonus.     "There was no evidence of vaginal penetration. And the DNA was a red herring. It doesn't eliminate anyone. Local authorities said finding a stranger's DNA on the child's panties eliminated everyone close to her. No.    "Suppose panties bought in Boulder were from a package handler in China. That handler would leave cells on it. If I just shake your hand, a microscopic tiny amount - one or two DNA cells from me - would be on your hand.    IN "Bridget Jones's Baby," a new familiar-old-friend film, Bridget (Renée Zellweger) ditches Colin Firth's character for Patrick Dempsey's, and somewhere there's Emma Thompson, who once played the "Hillary" role in 1998's "Primary Colors."     Colin: "I love even movies I'm not in. I go to movie theaters, like everyone else, with my children. I saw the original 'Bridget Jones' never dreaming I'd be in a sequel. When I was cast in this I went back to see the first one again."    At the Paris Theatre opening, metal detectors. Security guys with earpieces and other type pieces beneath bulging jackets. Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter, the immediate world's friend, inside a magnetometer. Hands outstretched. Doubling back to empty his pockets.

Were she hiding any weapon, only a gynecologist could've found it. This, to see a beautiful lovely movie. What is our world coming to?     CIVILIZATION needs another book on the GOP candidate?

December 30, 2016	 The New York Post	  In a year when whipsawing markets are poised to end much higher, one of Wall Street's most curious investments could come out on top: bitcoin.     The digital currency is one of the best-performing assets of 2016, rising more than 124 percent since the start of the year - as investors in China and India push the price near all-time highs.      That far outpaces other strong-performing investments, like the Dow Jones industrial average, which has risen a solid 13.7 percent this year, to 19,819.78.     One unit of bitcoin rose to $967.99 by late Thursday, the highest level in nearly three years, and investors are waiting for it to cross the $1,000 mark.     "It's gonna happen," Marc van der Chijs, managing partner at CrossPacific Capital and a bitcoin investor, told The Post. "Whether it's going to happen before Dec. 31, nobody really knows."    Wealthy investors have fueled a surge in bitcoin as the value of the Chinese yuan and the Indian rupee have fallen since the election of Donald Trump, he added.     "People underestimate how important the Trump election is on bitcoin," van der Chijs said. "People are worried. They don't really know what's going to happen."    Created eight years ago by a mysterious cryptographer who called himself Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin gained a niche as a way for people to buy and sell goods securely and anonymously online - without the backing of a government or a central bank.    "It's based on trust, based on the fact that other people see value as well," van der Chijs said. "It's not backed by anything. It's backed by mathematical equations."     While it's drawn praise from technologists and market bears - including Mick Mulvaney, who is Donald Trump's pick to run the Office of Management and Budget - bitcoin has been tainted by its association with shadier corners of the internet, including online drug bazaar The Silk Road and the imploded exchange Mt. Gox.     Two investors who are trying to bring the digital currency to the mainstream are Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss - the twins who famously claimed to co-invent Facebook.     The "Winklevii" are looking to win government approval for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund next year.  
January 8, 2017	 The New York Post	  Jared Kushner met with a Chinese real-estate magnate just days after the presidential election to discuss his family's property holdings - but is now extricating himself from the family business, a report said Saturday.     President-elect Donald Trump's son-in-law hobnobbed with Wu Xiaohui, CEO of the Anbang Insurance Group, at the Waldorf Astoria on Nov. 16. They talked about plans to redevelop the Kushner family-owned 41-story office and retail tower at 666 Fifth Ave., The New York Times ­reported.    Wu, who owns the Waldorf, toasted Trump and said he hoped to meet the president-elect because he would be "good for global business," according to the report.    The mysterious Chinese conglomerate with $285 billion in assets has drawn scrutiny from Wall Street firms and federal agencies for its byzantine ownership structure and ties to the Chinese government.      Kushner, 35, now appears to be clearing out potential business conflicts as he eyes a key role in the Trump White House.    He hired Washington firm C to help him comply with federal ethics laws and avoid conflicts of interest if he takes a job in the administration.     Kushner is moving toward divesting his assets in his company, whose acquisitions have been backed by billions of dollars in foreign investments, and is preparing to step down as CEO of Kushner Companies, the report said. 
October 21, 2016	 The New York Post	  In a wide-ranging interview at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit here, Bezos acknowledged he agreed to pay $250 million to buy the Washington Post from the Graham family in 2013 without looking at the books.    "I did zero due diligence," he told the Aspen Institute's Walter Isaacson during the interview. Bezos was tapped as the No. 1 mogul at this year's event.      "I did not negotiate. I accepted the asking price. [Then-Washington Post CEO] Donald Graham was the most honorable person in the world. He laid out every single [detail] worth knowing that was bad and everything that was great about the paper.     The billionaire said he is changing the business model and the culture at the paper from one where a small number of people pay a high price to one where a wide number of people pay a low price.     At the same time, he remains skeptical that consumers are ready to make micro-payments for articles.     Despite his business input, Bezos said he rarely ventures into the newsroom. "I call it the other Washington," the Seattle resident said of DC.     While the Bezos talk focused on Amazon's expansion and "the need to be nimble and robust and able to take a punch," it was politics that garnered the most attention in the 40-minute interview.     One questioner asked him what he thought of the disclosure this week that eBay co-founder Peter Thiel donated more than $1 million to the Trump campaign.    "Peter Thiel is a contrarian," said Bezos. "You have to remember that contrarians are usually wrong."    Thiel was an early backer of Facebook and still sits on its board. Bezos said that, while he might disapprove of the donation, he would not force such a person off a board of directors.     "It's way too divisive to say, 'If you have this opinion, you can't sit on my board.' That makes no sense."    Uber founder Travis Kalanick's decision this summer to sell the company's China unit to a local rival may come back to bite him.    Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-sharing company that bought Uber China, has plans to go global, which could put it on a collision course with Kalanick's sector-leading company.     "One thing I can share with you - we're definitely going global," Didi Chuxing President Jean Liu told attendees Thursday at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit here.     Just 24 hours earlier, Kalanick told the same gathering he was "happy" with the way he exited an expensive China foray - with a 20 percent stake in the combined company plus a board seat.    Kalanick, whose company is active in more than 70 countries and 400 cities, admitted he has not been to any Didi board meetings since the August deal.    Liu, whose company has 14 million drivers across China and provides more than 10 million rides a day, did say that it's possible that the global push could involve local partnerships.     "We're a big sponsor and a big believer in local players. If there are not existing local players, we'll go there by ourselves," she said.    Asked pointedly by Bloomberg's Emily Chang if that meant she was going to be competing with Uber, she said only, "We will definitely play a global game."    Apple owns a minority stake after investing $1 billion earlier this year, and e-commerce giant Alibaba inadvertently became a partner, too, when it backed a separate China-based ride-sharing company that was bought out by Didi.  
July 16, 2016	 The New York Post	The Issue: A terrorist driving a truck through a crowd in Nice, France, killing at least 84 and wounding scores.    Once again, medieval savages have brought terror upon innocent men, women and children ("Again," July 15).      We can now expect a few candlelight vigils and a speech by President Obama politicizing the matter.    These so-called lone-wolf attacks are so numerous that the use of the word "lone" is a misnomer. When will President Obama finally declare we're at war?    From Okinawa to the death march in Burma, President Franklin Roosevelt didn't just condemn every tragedy, he kept up the war effort. Were the acts against defenseless citizens in China committed by lone wolves?    The time has come to realize these attacks have been occurring on a nearly daily basis in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia as well as the United States.    Regardless of your social hot-button interest, the No. 1 issue facing America (and the rest of the world) is the accelerated spread of Islamic terrorism.    Yes, President George W. Bush and the Republicans lit the fuse by invading Iraq. But over the last eight years, President Obama has apologized for that mistake by pulling out and destabilizing the Middle East more than ever.    Donald Trump is a bombastic, egomaniacal bully who gets things done. I don't want to have dinner with him, but I want him to solve the No. 1 problem facing our country.    Trump is the right choice to slow and, hopefully, reverse the damage caused by Obama and Hillary Clinton over the past eight years.    How could that ­18-wheeler get past the security barriers and drive right into the Bastille Day celebration without any police action being taken?     If a truck came past security barriers in Times Square on New Year's Day or near the East River on July 4, police would have tried to kill the driver and disable the truck immediately.     There was a sizable military presence at the location for the event, which makes the failure to stop the killer more quickly so surprising.     Let's not be as stupid as the Europeans, who have allowed millions of refugees into their continent.     Allowing these refugees in increases the possibility that radical jihadists will enter the country and unleash their wrath.    These radical extremists are sick people and delight in killing. They must be kept out of the United States.    I'm sure that after the terrorist act in Nice, the Democrats will demand that we ban "assault trucks."    Now we wait for our politicians to complete their speeches and hand-wringing and for experts and pundits to pound their fists and pontificate on the proper course of action.    The civilized world is at war. The sooner our leaders realize this, the quicker we can kill this cancer. Peter Kelly 
October 30, 2016	 The New York Post	  Goldman is trying to persuade Apple to make a rival bid for Time Warner, a source with direct knowledge of the situation said.    "They are freaking out trying to convince Apple to come in," the source told our Josh Kosman. Goldman has been left on the sidelines in advising on AT&T's $85 billion agreement to acquire Time Warner.    In 2009, Apple hired Goldman banker Adrian Perica to head its mergers practice, and now he has his staff looking for acquisition targets, the source said.      Cook's company has expressed interest in buying Time Warner in the recent past, and there is some belief that judging from his comments this week, he will not let AT&T carry the day.    On Apple's earnings call on Wednesday, he said, "We are open to acquisitions of any size that are of strategic value, where we can deliver better products to our customers and innovate more. And so we look at a whole variety of companies, and based on that, we choose whether to move forward or not. But we're definitely open, and we definitely look."    "I would confirm that television has intense interest with me and many other people here. In terms of owning content and creating content." Goldman declined comment.    We hear that former Mayor Michael Bloomberg is hosting a little gathering at the Bloomberg Foundation for friends and family, while Snapchat, always big on the political party circuit, is also having a private event.     NBC star Seth Myers will be on hand to celebrate or commiserate with fellow comedians John Oliver and Sarah Silverman, who are part of the festivities put on by The National Resources Defense Council. Co-chairs of the Nov. 9 event include David and Pam Zaslav.     Bloomberg reported that Hillary Clinton will be spending the evening at New York's Javits Center. Donald Trump is slated to be in New York that night, but the campaign hasn't said where.     GOP Pollster Frank Luntz took some shots at both presidential candidates at an advertising dinner hosted by the Digital Place Based Advertising Association boss Barry Frey on Wednesday night.    Luntz joked that Donald Trump has immigrant wives because there are some jobs only an immigrant will do. Luntz, sporting limited edition colorful Adidas sneakers he bought in China, then joked that he has a bumper sticker that reads "Run Hillary," which he stuck on the front of his car, not the back.     "Anyone here voting for Gary Johnson?" he asked a room full of big advertisers. When someone shouted, "Yes," Luntz joked: "Paper, pipe or bong?"     But his more serious message to the room was about bringing people together after Election Day. "This country needs it so badly. Think of the people you are touching by your communication."    Cleveland Indians owner Larry Dolan promoted baseball in his family long before buying the team in 2000, his son Mark told Josh Kosman.    Larry coached his two sons, Mark and Indians CEO Paul, in little league. Paul, 57, is 1 ¹/  years older than Mark.    "Paul threw a no-hitter in an all-star game and struck me out too," Mark said, when they were both in their early teens.    The eccentric Joe Charboneau, 1980 AL Rookie of the Year who was best known for opening beer bottles with his eye socket.    As far as the World Series goes, the Indians will likely improve attendance by about 800,000 next season, a source close to the team said.    This year, it was 28th in league attendance despite its success with 1.6 million fans, for an average of 19,650 a game.    Adding 800,000 gives the Indians a $15 million to $20 million boost in cash flow. Presently, it's about break-even.    That's per a research note by Buckingham Research analyst John Zolidis, according to our Lisa Fickenscher. While Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington have legalized recreational use of marijuana, and Arizona, Nevada, California, Maine and Massachusetts have ballot initiatives next week, Zolidis writes, pot isn't legal for use in eating establishments - although people often use it as a substitute for alcohol, which is a big money-maker for restaurants. At this point, the only eateries likely to benefit from more people having the munchies are pizza joints and other places with good delivery service. 
December 7, 2016	 The New York Post	  Donald Trump's controversial phone call from Taiwan was reportedly ­arranged by a lobbyist with a familiar name - former Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole.    Dole, 93, has been working for the Taiwanese government as a foreign agent, The New York Times reported.     The ex-Kansas senator, who ran against Bill Clinton in 1996, helped establish the high-level US-Taiwan contact. It drew a complaint from China, which considers Taiwan part of its territory. 
December 13, 2016	 The New York Post	  As he prepares to leave office, President Obama "sees an opposition Republican Party dominating America at the federal, state and local levels to a degree unseen since the 1920s," writes Timothy Lee at the Center for Individual Freedom. This after eight years of his having "demonized Republicans and questioned their very morality, hoping to convince the electorate that they're unfit to govern." So much for Obama's oft-stated determination to occupy "the right side of history." Fact is, "the arc of the moral universe" - Martin Luther King's phrase that became the president's watchword - "simply did not bend in the way Obama presumed." Says Lee: "The good news is that time occasionally catches up" with such phrases "and exposes their artifice."    New York is heading over the next three years to a $15-an-hour minimum wage, its highest ever. But the Empire Center's E.J. McMahon, writing for Crain's New York, says it's a journey "into uncharted territory, fraught with risks and trade-offs for workers and businesses." The initial downside "may be less apparent" if employment in the city continues to rise with favorable economic conditions. But "those early numbers will be misleading - because they won't show the added job growth that would have occurred if the minimum wage stayed the same." The bottom line: "The real minimum wage remains zero - the amount earned by someone who can't find a job. Unfortunately, thanks to the rising minimum wage, more New Yorkers are likely to fall into that category."    ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson reportedly remains President-elect Donald Trump's top choice for secretary of state. And despite his lack of government or political experience, Ellen R. Wald at Forbes suggests there are "several reasons" why "his unique experience would make him . . . unusually effective." He's "an experienced and accomplished negotiator" with "foreign and US governments and major international conglomerates." He has "experience managing a large operation," and he "knows world leaders and understands their motivations." As for his ties to Vladimir Putin, many of those raising concerns also "consider Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad's friendly ties to Chinese President Xi Jinping a positive component of his appointment as ambassador to China."    Ira Stoll at The Algemeiner takes issue with a recent New York Times review of a new documentary about an Israeli basketball team. The film, "On the Map," chronicles the team's surprising 1977 victory in the prestigious European basketball championship. But the Times complains that the film is "relentlessly partisan" and "makes no attempt to engage any current situation." Says Stoll, "If anyone is being one-dimensional here, it is The New York Times, which seems to want to view nearly every piece of art that ever comes out of Israel" through the paper's "obsession [with] the contemporary Israeli-Palestinian conflict." As "an example of press bias, this one is a slam dunk."    The move to get enough Republican members of the Electoral College to switch their votes and toss the election to Hillary Clinton is "all a shadow play - entertaining, provocative, but bearing no relation to current political reality." For one thing, writes Jeff Greenfield for The Daily Beast, Donald Trump's "electoral majority is simply too big." But even if it happened, those votes "would have to be validated by the appropriate state official." And if found to violate state law requiring votes for their pledged candidate, "that official might well refuse to count" a switched vote. Yet even then, Congress must unanimously accept the results of the Electoral College vote - and both houses are GOP-controlled. In other words, it won't happen. 
December 22, 2016	 The New York Post	  On Monday, President Obama strongly urged Donald Trump not to rely too much on executive orders, suggesting the next president instead go "through the legislative process." The next day, Obama issued one of the most egregious executive orders of his entire presidency.     The ban on offshore drilling in 120 million acres of federal waters in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans is just the latest in a string. In recent days, the lame-duck president has issued executive orders on everything from Planned Parenthood funding to failing schools to new criminal pardons.    One pundit described it all as frantically trying to nail down everything to the floor so it can't be moved.    Obama claims his drilling ban is permanent and can't be undone by Trump, because the obscure 1953 law he used says nothing about a president undoing such an order.     We'll see: It's never been tested in court, but previous presidents have partially lifted earlier bans under that statute.    Still, Obama likely has delayed any drilling for years while a legal battle ensues, unless Congress can amend the original law.     The order is a pure pander to the anti-fossil-fuels fanatics. Yet America's - and the world's - need for fossil fuels won't vanish anytime soon. (Heck, China and India keep building coal-fired power plants.) Limiting US energy production won't "heal the planet," but merely sacrifice opportunities for American workers.     In any case, the rules for exploitation of federal resources are a matter for normal lawmaking - not for law-stretching action by a president out to tie his successor's hands.    With his days in the Oval Office dwindling away, Obama should start heeding his own advice on executive orders.  
October 27, 2016	 The New York Post	   I know that by now I'm supposed to anoint Hillary Clinton as the next president - and give up on the crazy notion that Donald Trump will win.    And I'll say it again. I don't care who wins. I don't like either, although I find someone as crooked and careless as Hillary more troublesome than a pig like Donald.    And while most (all?) of the media has written off Trump, the mogul hasn't said or done anything stupid in days and he's neck-and-neck with Hillary in some big polls and gaining in others.     We've seen a lot of hacked e-mails from others that have been damaging to Hillary but none of her e-mails. Unless someone puts the kibosh on the release of Hillary's personal e-mails - which we know were stolen - there could be a lot of very damaging things coming out about her between now and Nov. 8.    So, I thought today would be a good column to discuss what might happen to various financial markets if Trump should win.     n  Because of the media's obvious strong bias toward Hillary, the election of Trump would cause a shock similar to the one that was supposed to happen when Britain decided a few months ago to leave the European Union.     This Brexit, as the British pullout is known, wasn't supposed to happen - at least if you believed polls that were just as one-sided then as the ones in our presidential election now.    So the stock market could quiver if Trump is elected, especially shares of media companies that could suffer a presidential vendetta. And multinational firms that could be hurt, too, if Trump keeps his pledge to redo trade agreements.    Companies that do business in China and Mexico could suffer the most, because those countries have been special Trump targets.    Defense companies will benefit because Trump has vowed to boost the military. And materials and construction companies will also be helped because of his proposals to rebuild the country's infrastructure.    The stock market as a whole, however, could get banged hard, at least for a few weeks or months. That's the same prediction many made after the Brexit vote, but the markets were just fine.    But there's a difference now. After Brexit, the German government, the European Union and perhaps others intervened to keep the financial markets steady.     If Trump moves into the White House, he probably won't get that kind of help - at least not right away - from the central bank or Wall Street.     He's feuding not only with Federal Reserve Chair  Janet Yellen - who he thinks has been incompetent - but also with Wall Street.    So Wall Street might try to teach president-elect Trump a lesson by letting the market collapse a bit.    Everyone already agrees that the Fed will soon raise interest rates. But the financial markets might not wait for the Fed if Trump is elected.    Both Hillary and Trump have vowed to spend more money to get the economy going. The problem is that the US already has $20 trillion in debt. So any additional spending will get people worrying about inflation.    And inflation worries will cause interest rates to rise. And rising rates automatically mean bond prices will fall.     Rising rates also mean that the federal deficit will go up because Washington - like everyone else - will have to pay more to borrow money.    But Trump's election would bring another uncertainty into the bond market equation. He's already shown his disdain for Yellen, and there have been reports that she doesn't plan to leave that post if Trump is elected.    A fight for control over the Fed - while the dream of every columnist - would be tough on bond investors.    n  Oil prices will decline if Trump is elected - good for consumers, not so good for investors in the stuff.    That's straightforward. Trump has vowed to pump as much oil as possible in the US and make the country even more energy self-sufficient.    n   You have to be very sophisticated to invest in the US dollar. But in the end, it either goes up or down.    The minute Trump wins, the dollar will react to his threats regarding trade deals. This is all very tricky, but here's how it was explained to me.    Because the US has a trade deficit, our dollars end up in the hands of other countries. To be safe, those countries hedge - essentially buy insurance - against a decline in all the dollars they have accumulated.    If Trump wins and the dollar starts to fall, all those countries holding massive amounts of our currency will have to buy dollars to cover their shorts.     So the dollar could rise if Trump is elected - except if foreign investors see him as a possibly reckless leader. Then the dollar will lose its value as a "safe haven" in an otherwise unpredictable world.    Donald Trump is gaining in the polls, and an anti-Hillary Clinton November surprise is still expected. So if Trump wins on Nov. 8, here's what investors could expect: 
January 21, 2017	 The New York Post	  Controversial tech investor Peter Thiel has found himself wrapped up in another sticky lawsuit - only this time he has a lot more than his reputation at stake.    Thiel invested in the telecom startup that lost a spectrum auction Nov. 4 - because, the company claims in court papers, the Mexican government and its rival acted improperly.    The dispute, simmering in a Mexican court, pits the only US bidder for the spectrum against the Mexican government as the new Trump administration is looking to reset trade relations with President Enrique Peña Nieto.    The international dustup centers on Rivada Networks, the startup backed in part by the Facebook billionaire's Mithril Capital.     The nasty legal battle includes allegations that seem ripped from the pages of a script for a Mexican telenovela.    For example, one person involved in the deal is accused of murder. Then there are stolen corporate documents and accusations of favoritism at the highest levels of Nieto's government.    "We are continuing the lawsuit because we are convinced we were the victims of [bad behavior]," said Declan Ganley, CEO of Rivada. "Plus, we don't want to see the people of Mexico's opportunity for this potential network disappear."    The spectrum auction, overseen by the Mexican government, is the first step to bring high-speed, low-cost wireless services to millions of Mexicans by early 2018.    Rivada, based in Herndon, Va., gathered a group of high-net-worth investors, including Charlie Ergen's EchoStar and Ricky Sandler's Eminence Capital, to enter the auction - one of the world's most lucrative.    In addition to powerful investors, Rivada also boasted an A-list board, including Jeb Bush, Gen. Richard B. Myers and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley.    Rivada Networks operates wireless networks from Argentina to Ireland, and it is currently bidding for the right to create first responder networks all over the US as part of a project called FirstNet.    Rivada had high hopes heading into last fall - but feels Nieto's government acted to hand the lucrative spectrum to Altán, Rivada's only rival in the auction, according to a lawsuit it filed in a Mexican court and interviews with company brass.    l Nieto's Secretaria de Communicaciones y Transportes [SCT], the country's communications department, allowed Altán to eyeball nonpublic bidding documents, giving it an improper advantage.     "Rivada learned through credible sources that the Altán Consortium was improperly given access to the confidential internal SCT Business Model, which outlined the internal standards by which SCT was to judge the bids," court papers allege.     "In fact, the Business Model was used as a 'cheat sheet' for Altán's preparation of its bid: the bid, Rivada has learned, was identical to the Business Model in multiple, critical respects," court papers said.     "[Altán's] winning proposal to roll out Red Compartida [the spectrum market] is entirely original, independent and unique. Altán has not sought or had access to insider information at any point during the process."    l Nieto's administration improperly booted Ergen's EchoStar from the Rivada group just four days before the bids were due, citing antitrust issues.    "We had to reformat with other shareholders," said Rivada's Ganley, who said the group's financing also had to be quickly retooled.    "There were some inexplicable obstacles that rose from [partner bank] Banamex at the last minute," Ganley told The Post.    Rivada submitted its bid on Oct. 20, with an asset- backed corporate guarantee for $250 million and later, on Oct. 31, submitted a letter of credit from BBVA, a Spanish bank. The SCT said the completed bid missed the deadline.     Rivada claims under Mexican law governing private/public partnerships, if the deficiency isn't fatal the SCT was obligated to consider it, "and not throw someone out over a technicality," Ganley explained to The Post. "The law is about having competition for these things."    l  Ganley claims Rivada's bid boxes were robbed by a mystery motorcyclist just days before the bid was due.    The motorcyclist grabbed the boxes from a female employee, Ganley said. Fortunately for Rivada, the boxes did not contain the bids.     In addition to its legal arguments, Rivada said the Altán bid shouldn't have won because it is backed by Chinese technology.    Altán, backed by Morgan Stanley, the World Bank and the Chinese investors, is said to use technology from China-based Huawei, according to Rivada. That Chinese technology is being used just across the US border, Ganley says.    "My understanding is they plan to use Chinese technology," the CEO said. "That would never be allowed in the US."     Altán is backed by the China Mexico Fund, which has 23.36 percent stake in Altán. Industry sources say that the China Mexico Fund is a limited partner and that the group has not yet selected tech providers.    Early in the process, the adviser, British telecom expert Richard Alden, was forced to quit the Altán team after he was arrested on suspicion of murdering a woman last year in Kenya.    The woman was found dead at his home. Altán acknowledged on a call with Morgan Stanley last week that Alden had been on its team. The arrest stunned the Rivada team.    "We all need to make sure that those who are thinking of investing in Mexico [know] not only that it has courts that work, [but] that they hold everyone to the highest standards," Ganley said.    Altán, in response, said that things are much simpler than they appear. Rivada Networks "didn't present the bid bond when required by the rules detailed in the tender process."    Altán Group says its rivals are just sore losers who simply didn't follow the rules of the bid process.     "It has been a competitive process and compliant with Mexican law and practices in international tender process," a spokeswoman told The Post.    As for Thiel, he must be hoping this latest trip to court is as successful as his last. The billionaire bankrolled Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker that ended with a Hogan victory. 
May 13, 2016	 The New York Post	  LAS VEGAS - There are few places where Will Smith, Caitlyn Jenner, John Boehner, and Kobe Bryant are the sideshow - but that was exactly the scene on Thursday as the hedge fund industry gathered here for its annual powwow.     With the average fund facing a third straight year of losses - and many investors pulling their cash - the powerful investors were in no mood to party or to mingle much with the celebrity set.    Sure there were panel discussions on various investment choices and plenty of talk about politics - Donald Trump's national finance chairman Steve Mnuchin was making the rounds - but most of the action took place in a mammoth back conference room.    In the conference room, fund managers sat at communal tables or on the patio dissecting pitch books, pushing investment ideas, all in the hopes of taking in potentially billions of dollars.     David Dunn, the president of Kingsbridge Wealth Management, with $150 million of assets under management, told The Post that he was pitched by 57 funds last year. He invested in four.     It's harder to find a "better trade" in a crowded field of managers, Dunn said. "Smaller niche strategies are where the real return is."    There's more urgency to raise capital this year because, as one manager put it, "you don't want to be the fund that lost money."    There's an underlying fear in the hedge fund world that the spigot of money is about to get shut off.     In the past year, giant pensions in California and New York have pulled billions of dollars in investments. This year, so, too, have insurance giants AIG and MetLife.     "Over the last couple of years, I'm kind of disappointed with the performance," Roslyn Zhang, a managing director at the China Investment Corp., told attendees at one session.    Hedge funds raised $4 billion in February - down from $23 billion the year before, Ilana Weinstein of the IDW group said at Milken private equity conference in LA earlier this month.     Top fundraisers for Trump made pitches to hedge fund investors to line up behind the presumptive Republican presidential nominee as he seeks to raise $1 billion for the general election campaign, Reuters reports.    Mnuchin met with some of the attending hedge fund managers seeking to raise money for his new boss.    Also speaking at the event was former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who in an onstage interview, declined to endorse any candidate. Earlier this year, Bloomberg flirted with an independent candidacy, but decided against it for fear it would help Trump's chances of getting elected.    Best-selling author Michael Lewis, who has written extensively on Wall Street, pushed back at comments made by Citadel's Ken Griffin, who said during a panel discussion that the IEX exchange posted stale numbers.    "He's just talking his book," said Lewis, who noted his upcoming October book will be a prequel to "The Big Short." 
May 31, 2016	 The New York Post	  Folks, it's time to wake up and smell the sunscreen. Bikini season is here - and that means working on a six-pack rather than drinking one. If you need help getting in shape before Labor Day, check out these magazines for getting swimsuit-worthy advice.    Self talks to cover girl Sophie Turner, better known as Sansa Stark from HBO's "Game of Thrones," about her role as Jean Gray in the summer tentpole film "X-Men: Apocalypse." The result is a little bit more interesting than her Wikipedia page - for instance, she's a blonde and not a redhead in real life - but it doesn't go far beyond that. An interview with Olympic gold medalist Gabrielle Douglas morphs into a story about how "exercise is an expression of your personality." This magazine is fine for reading whenever you make it onto the elliptical machine, but don't expect much else. The number of ads featuring chocolate: 3.    Shape magazine is getting lazy, which is why it's a poor choice for readers looking to get whipped into shape. "Give in to your urge to splurge" oozes one feature with a picture of a perfect chocolate cake. "Including decadent foods (even cake!) in your diet can actually help you shed pounds," it declares. Elsewhere, it's hard to find an article about cutting calories or tightening abs. Kate Hudson, in her cover story, says she "absolutely believe[s] in enjoying my food, especially when I travel." There's zero mention of how she's rich and famous and can afford personal trainers. Skip this mag. Ads with chocolate: 5.    Health actually goes a bit deeper than the epidermal with its cover model, US Women's Soccer gold medalist Alex Morgan. The 26-year-old forward highlights the gender gap and blasts FIFA for paying women far less than men. In other indignities, women play on synthetic turf while the men's teams play on grass. "That's just proof to us that FIFA doesn't see us as equals to the men," she says. It's worth picking up for the interview, even if the rest of the mag is pretty interchangeable with the others. Ads with chocolate: 5    Women's Health gets another "X-Men" star, Olivia Munn, for its cover story. The actress blasts sports media for blaming her during her boyfriend Aaron Rodger's losing streak with the Green Bay Packers last year. The magazine does a pretty good job of being an overall read, rather than just the usual workout regimens and diet tips. There's even a music section that, amazingly, recommends Brian Eno's "Ambient 1: Music for Airports" for "melting stress." Bravo. Ads with chocolate: 3. With caramel: 2.    With Memorial Day come and gone, the liberal media has come down with a case of heat exhaustion with respect to the White House race. In "Talk of the Town," the New Yorker touches upon the increasingly uncomfortable subject of Bill Clinton, and the mixed effects he seems to be having on Hillary's campaign - getting roped into half-hour debates with millennial campaigners for Bernie Sanders, for example. Bill "is not the presence that he was, physically, or politically" when he was president," Amy Davidson notes. Meanwhile, financial columnist James Surowiecki, invoking some research about the psychology of financial losses, makes the interesting case that Donald Trump's supporters are in a gambling mood. Not good for Hillary's supposed appeal as a safe choice. Good thing this is the summer fiction issue.    New York slaps Hillary on its cover this week, declaring that "there is nothing simple about Hillary Clinton." Inside, we get a strenuous attempt at a puff piece that insists that when you get up close, Hillary is actually a great gal - warm, charismatic, smart, etc., etc. Given this interesting information, it's never explained why Hillary won't let reporters near her on the campaign trail. Apparently, in exchange for the special access she got, writer Rebecca Traister was polite enough not to ask this question. Elsewhere, Frank Rich makes the case that "the Trump candidacy looks a lot more like Reagan's than anyone might care to notice." Smart piece, Frank.    Meanwhile, the Atlantic, which recently lost top editor James Bennet to the New York Times, shows the perils of allowing a nonjournalist to write a cover story. In this case, it's a 13-page sprawler on "the mind of Donald Trump" written by a psychology professor at Northwestern University. "Who, really, is Donald Trump?" Dan McAdams asks in what the candidate himself might call an "incredibly weak" final paragraph. "I can discern little more than narcissistic motivations and a complementary personal narrative about winning at any cost." Thanks - we could have gleaned that by reading the inside flap of "The Art of the Deal." Better to check out the thought-pieces on free will and China's shrinking population. 
August 9, 2016	 The New York Post	  In a breakthrough for the Durst Organization that's also welcome news for the Port Authority and the city, financial securities firm ICAP has leased 82,442 square feet at 4 Times Square, with an expansion option of up to an additional 41,221 square feet.    It's the first deal in what's expected to be a gradual, but inevitable, lease-up of Condé Nast's former space in the 1.8-million-square-foot tower at West 42nd Street.     It's also a boost for Midtown, which has recently seen an exodus of some high-profile tenants to downtown, the far West Side and Midtown South. ICAP will be leaving some of its current space at Harborside Plaza in Jersey City.    The ICAP lease follows a $100 million capital-improvements program at 4 Times Square, which was state-of-the-art when Douglas Durst opened it in 2000, but needed contemporizing to compete with newer product. The upgrades include new entrances, lobby and elevator cabs - plus "preservation and enhancement" of Condé Nast's famous cafeteria designed by Frank Gehry, which will be the "cornerstone of a shared amenity and conference center space."    The PA is reimbursing Durst for Condé Nast's rent on the rest of its 4 Times Square lease through 2019, as an inducement for the publisher's move to One World Trade Center, where Durst is a 10-percent partner. The PA has been paying Durst $3 million a month for Condé's former space.    Condé left behind 817,000 square feet on floors 4-24. The asking rent on ICAP's new space was around $85 per square foot, sources said.    More Midtown good news: Dentons, the world's largest law firm, has extended its 210,000-square-foot lease at Rockefeller Group's 1221 Sixth Ave. The firm has been there since 1992. It's now extended its current lease for floors 23-26 through April 2025.    It's the third deal at 1221 Sixth since Rockefeller completed a capital-improvement program including new entrances, side-street plazas, a new street-level facade and interior stone work. The 2.5- million-square-footer is 93 percent leased.    The new, family-friendly Times Square has been called "Disneyfied," wholesome, vibrant, and tourist-trampled - but not sophisticated or chic.    That might change in 2017 with the opening of the Edition by Marriott Times Square at the congested corner of Seventh Avenue and West 47th Street. It will be Manhattan's second "luxury lifestyle" Edition property, following the one at Madison Square Park.    The 39-story hotel with cutting-edge interiors designed by Ian Schrager and Yabu Pushelberg has 5-star aspirations, according to developer Steven Witkoff. It will be aimed at a more trendy clientele than at other inns along the "Bowtie." (His partners are Winthrop Realty Trust, Howard Lorber's New Valley and Mark Siffin's Maefield Development.    While guest rooms will be high-end, the tower's lower floors are likely to draw the spectacle-seeking hordes. Leases have been signed with two mass-market tenants, it has been reported. The NFL and Cirque du Soleil are jointly creating a 40,000-square-foot interactive exhibition and entertainment venue on the third and fourth levels. Hershey's will move into a ground-floor space three times larger than its current 2,000 square feet across the street.     But, we asked Witkoff: Why was it seeming to take so long? Although the project was first announced in 2012, a steel framework began to take form only recently. "As we began excavating for the foundation, we found that old footings were attached to nothing," he explained. "They were literally floating free."    "We knew we had to shore it up, but before we could pull [Buildings Department] permits, we had to go back to the MTA" - necessary because the N, R and Q lines run directly beneath, Witkoff said. The process added "eight or nine months."    I was surprised to receive a shout-out from Donald Trump in his speech in Detroit on Monday. But the Feb. 7 column from which he quoted was a celebration of his early real estate accomplishments in New York - not a presidential endorsement.    While I believe Trump's projects in the 1970s-1990s are underappreciated, I also lamented his later "cartoonish TV personality, "selling his name to just about any developer willing to sign a check," "like the Trump Soho Hotel, which he neither built nor owns" and "tacky promotion of China-made shirts and ties among other goofy ventures."    I also wrote that he "was a better developer than a dealmaker." But I stand by my claims for Trump's role in helping to rescue the crumbling city. 
August 29, 2016	 The New York Post	'The fact a major Clinton Foundation donor was denied entry into the US over ties to the terrorist group Hezbollah is deeply troubling, especially when this individual had access to top aides at Hillary Clinton's State Department.' -  Trump spokesman Jason Miller     A Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire who donated millions to Clinton-family nonprofits was denied a visa to enter the United States last year on terrorism-related grounds, according to a new report.     Gilbert Chagoury, who donated millions to the Clinton Foundation and in 2009 pledged $1 billion to the Clinton Global Initiative, was denied entry last summer amid a review of his ties in Lebanon to Hezbollah, the Los Angeles Times reported Sunday.     "The fact a major Clinton Foundation donor was denied entry into the US over ties to the terrorist group Hezbollah is deeply troubling, especially when this individual had access to top aides at Hillary Clinton's State Department," Trump spokesman Jason Miller said Sunday, calling for the release of Clinton's schedules and the shutdown of the charity.    The Trump team also released a new Web ad Sunday accusing the Clinton Foundation of being a "slush fund" that "sold access to the State Department."    Chagoury, who owns Africa's largest construction company, had unique access to the State Department, Hillary Clinton's e-mails revealed.    The billionaire was on the Department of Homeland Security's no-fly list in 2010 and was pulled off a plane. He's now on the "selectee" list that allows him to fly with extra scrutiny. Chagoury has denied any support for the terrorist group.    Clinton maintains she never took action as secretary of state because of any donations to the foundation. The Clintons have announced they will stop accepting foundation donations from foreign interests if Clinton wins the White House.    Meanwhile, new e-mails show a top Clinton Foundation official, Doug Band, handpicked mega donors to attend a State Department lunch with then-Chinese President Hu Jintao in January 2011, ABC News reported.    Band e-mailed Clinton aide Huma Abedin in December 2010 suggesting names of Clinton Foundation donors to attend the high-profile event: Bob McCann, the then-president of wealth management at UBS; Dr. Judith Rodin, the president of The Rockefeller Foundation; and Hikmet Ersek, the CEO of Western Union.    It wasn't clear if the special favor for Clinton donors resulted in their attendance at the luncheon.    Asked about the revelation, current Democratic National Committee leader Donna Brazile, a longtime supporter of the Clintons, told ABC, "I don't see where the smoke is."    "I've been a government official," Brazile told "This Week." "So, you know, this notion that, somehow or another, someone who is a supporter, someone who is a donor, somebody who's an activist, saying, 'I want access, I want to come into a room and I want to meet people' - we often criminalize behavior that is normal," Brazile said. "I don't see what the smoke is." 
November 18, 2016	 The New York Post	  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called President-elect Donald Trump a "trustworthy leader" Thursday after a meeting at which Abe sought clarity on international trade agreements and US-Asian alliances.    "The talks made me feel sure that we can build a relationship of trust," Abe told reporters after the meeting at Trump Tower.     The parley came amid Japanese anxiety about the future strength of an alliance that is at the core of its security. The nation is faced with a nuclear-armed North Korea and a newly assertive China.    The meeting also included Trump's daughter Ivanka, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn.  
December 31, 2016	 The New York Post	  Now he gets tough? President Obama's actions against Russia - booting 35 suspected spies, closing two government compounds and sanctioning its intelligence agencies - are certainly deserved.     As House Speaker Paul Ryan noted, they are "an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy" with Moscow.     But, frankly, it's a little too little, too late. After all, kicking out spies should be par for the course. And the hacking, while troubling, was - let's be honest - minor compared to the evils Russia committed with impunity during Obama's tenure.     Besides, the FBI first informed the Democratic National Committee over a year ago that its e-mails had been hacked. And though a top administration aide met with Russian officials in April to complain about cyberattacks, the White House chose not to disclose them for months.    You've certainly got to question Obama's motives and timing. Consider, why was there no similarly appropriate response when Russia invaded Crimea, moved to destabilize Ukraine or supplied the missile that downed a Malaysian plane, killing 298?    Or when China hacked the Office of Personnel Management, exposing the records of 22 million government employees?    Yes, Obama eventually sanctioned some of Vladimir Putin's oligarch friends. But he nixed more forceful action, like resurrecting a missile-defense plan for Eastern Europe and offering non-lethal aid to Ukraine.    Fact is, Obama's indecision and failure to defend America's allies spurred Putin to push the envelope in Europe and Syria.     So what's going on now? First, Obama hopes to bolster the absurd Democratic notion that Russia "stole" the election, undermining Donald Trump's legitimacy.     He also may think his moves will commit Trump and leave him at odds with Russia, foiling the new president's goal of smoothing ties. One problem: Putin's not cooperating. He's refusing reciprocal sanctions and saying he'll seek a fresh start with Trump.    The new team must beware; Putin isn't to be trusted. But let's hold the applause for Obama. As deserved as his moves against Russia may be, his hands are far from clean. 
January 14, 2017	 The New York Post	  JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America reported solid fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, buoyed by a trading frenzy in the wake of Donald Trump's election.      JPMorgan Chase beat expectations with a 24 percent increase in profit, to $6.73 billion from $5.43 billion during the same period a year earlier. Net income totaled $1.71 a share, beating analysts' estimates of $1.43.    Chief Executive Jamie Dimon made a pitch during a Friday conference call for the deregulation of Wall Street, arguing that the Obama-era rules had held back economic growth.     "No rational person that I know could possibly say that all the things done were accurate, coordinated, consistent, proper and made it a safer system," Dimon said on a call with journalists. "It's time to take a look at that. I hope the new administration does."    Brian Moynihan, Bank of America's chief executive pushed a narrative of "responsible growth" during a conference call.     Profit was up 43 percent on a nearly $1 billion cut in non-interest expenses, as $19.9 billion in revenue missed analysts' expectations.     The bank also projected it would buy back about $1.8 billion in stock during the first half of the year.     "The optimism for positive change here at BofA and among our customers is palpable and has driven prices higher," Moynihan said during the conference call.    The final three months of 2016 were a roller coaster of major financial events, with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, Trump's election sparking a trading frenzy and the fallout from Wells Fargo's fake-accounts scandal taking hold.     The year started with one of the sector's worst quarters ever as stocks cratered on plummeting oil prices and weakness in the Chinese economy.    Friday was the first earnings announcement for Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan, who stepped into the role in October after John Stumpf buckled under intense pressure to resign in the wake of the bank's fake-accounts scandal.     It wasn't good. The bank's profits slipped 5.4 percent, to $5.27 billion, or 96 cents a share. Analysts expected a buck a share.     "We continued to make progress in the fourth quarter in rebuilding the trust of our customers, team members and other key stakeholders," Sloan said in a statement.  
January 20, 2017	 The New York Post	  International Data Group, the company founded by the late billionaire Pat McGovern, has sold the majority stake to China Oceanwide Holdings.    Following McGovern's death in 2014, the company was controlled by its investment arm, IDG Capital, which counts Accel Partners and Breyer Capital as limited partners.    China Oceanwide is headed by billionaire Lu Zhiqiang. At one point, IDG Capital and Oceanwide were bidding against each other for the publisher.    But at the suggestion of Goldman Sachs, which represented IDG, the two decided to do a combined bid.    Hugo Shong, the IDG Capital boss and a longtime IDG executive and protégé of McGovern, is expected to be named chairman of the new joint venture, sources tell Media Ink.      Under McGovern, the publisher of PCWorld, Macworld and CIO Magazine expanded to publish more than 200 magazines worldwide - most now available only in digital format.     After its founding as a data company in 1964, IDG grew into an international behemoth with more than 60 titles in China alone. It also has a joint venture with Hearst to publish the Chinese versions of Cosmo, Esquire and Harper's Bazaar.    Terms of the deal were not disclosed, although Reuters had previously reported that IDG was in talks to sell itself to an undisclosed Chinese buyout firm for $500 million to $1 billion.      Forbes Media was taken over in 2014 by Integrated Whale Media, controlled by Hong Kong financiers Yam Tak-Cheung (aka TC Yam) and Wong Siu Wah (aka Sammy Wong), along with Singapore businessman Wayne Hsieh.     Then in November, Guggenheim Partners sold Dick Clark Productions for $1 billion to Dalian Wanda Group, the world's No. 1 cinema owner, controlled by billionaire Wang Jianlin.     Richard Beckman, who exited as chief revenue officer at Vice Media last year, has landed at Discovery-backed Group Nine Media, parent of Thrillist and other sites, as its chief revenue officer.    Discovery, the cable-TV powerhouse, announced in October that it was putting $100 million into the company controlled by Lerer Hippeau Ventures and headed by Ben Lerer.      The move seems aimed at getting video producers more into the long- form video game, rather than being an old-fashioned traffic play.     "We have a combined 4.2 billion video views per month," Beckman said. "These are video views - not impressions. It shows engagement - and engagement is replacing reach for the sake of reach."    Beckman also joked that the "Mad Dog" nickname he picked up when he was an up-and-coming executive at Condé Nast - and which stuck with him as CEO at Prometheus Global Media and co-founder of the now defunct Three Lions Entertainment - is being usurped by Donald Trump's pick for Defense secretary, James "Mad Dog" Mattis.     "I've had it for more than 20 years," he said in mock indignation, "but I think my real title should be Alchemist, formerly known as Mad Dog."    Time is shuffling the deck again, although this week's shakeup, which has 30 people heading for the exits, is not seen as quite as big a jolt as the earthquake that hit last July, eliminating all publisher jobs.     Among those who are exiting the company - either through job eliminations or early retirement packages - are executives who were handed promotions only seven months ago:     In the latest moves, Greg Schumann and Karen Kovacs were each elevated to the rank of group presidents, sales.     Schumann, who was overseeing pharmaceuticals, will be in charge of auto, financial services, government/industry, home and technology/telecommunications.     Susan Parkes-Cirignano, formerly in People public relations, become senior vice president, advertising and brand marketing.  
September 5, 2016	 The New York Post	  Jayson Heyward blooped the Giants to death Sunday at Wrigley, which caused Hondo to suffer a third straight setback that reduced his earnings to 3,589 northrups.      Monday: Mr. Aitch expects Zoolander to be a model of excellence against the White Sox - 20 units on the Tigers to shred Sale.     Word out of China is Obama was very upset about the way he and his staff were treated when the U.S. delegation arrived in Hangzhou. Rumor has it that in an attempt to ensure it doesn't happen again, he has ordered Secretary of State John Kerry to send a couple of pallets of cash to the Chinese government ... Donald Trump has taken a one-point lead over Hillary Clinton, according to a Reuters-Ipsos poll. The Pantsuit will address that development, along with the latest on her email scandals, if she ever comes out of hiding and ends her media blackout, which presently stands at 275 days.  
October 27, 2016	 The New York Post	   I know that by now I'm supposed to anoint Hillary Clinton as the next president - and give up on the crazy notion that Donald Trump will win.    And I'll say it again. I don't care who wins. I don't like either, although I find someone as crooked and careless as Hillary more troublesome than a pig like Donald.    And while most (all?) of the media has written off Trump, the mogul hasn't said or done anything stupid in days and he's neck and neck with Hillary in some big polls and gaining in others.     We've seen a lot of hacked e-mails from others that have been damaging to Hillary but none of her e-mails. Unless someone puts the kibosh on the release of Hillary's personal e-mails - which we know were stolen - there could be a lot of very damaging things coming out about her between now and Nov. 8.    So, I thought today would be a good column to discuss what might happen to various financial markets if Trump should win.     n  Because of the media's obvious strong bias toward Hillary, the election of Trump would cause a shock similar to the one that was supposed to happen when Britain decided a few months ago to leave the European Union.     This Brexit, as the British pullout is known, wasn't supposed to happen - at least if you believed polls that were just as one-sided then as the ones in our presidential election now.    So the stock market could quiver if Trump is elected, especially shares of media companies that could suffer a presidential vendetta. And multinational firms that could be hurt, too, if Trump keeps his pledge to redo trade agreements.    Companies that do business in China and Mexico could suffer the most, because those countries have been special Trump targets.    Defense companies will benefit because Trump has vowed to boost the military. And materials and construction companies will also be helped because of his proposals to rebuild the country's infrastructure.    The stock market as a whole, however, could get banged hard at least for a few weeks or months. That's the same prediction many made after the Brexit vote, but the markets were just fine.    But there's a difference now. After Brexit, the German government, the European Union and perhaps others intervened to keep the financial markets steady.     If Trump moves into the White House, he probably won't get that kind of help - at least not right away - from central banks or Wall Street.     He's feuding not only with Federal Reserve Chair  Janet Yellen - who he thinks has been incompetent - but also with Wall Street.    So Wall Street might try to teach president-elect Trump a lesson by letting the market collapse a bit.    Everyone already agrees that the Fed will soon raise interest rates. But the financial markets might not wait for the Fed if Trump is elected.    Both Hillary and Trump have vowed to spend more money to get the economy going. The problem is that the US already has $20 trillion in debt. So any additional spending will get people worrying about inflation.    And inflation worries will cause interest rates to rise. And rising rates automatically mean bond prices will fall.     Rising rates also mean that the federal deficit will go up because Washington - like everyone else - will have to pay more to borrow money.    But Trump's election would bring another uncertainty into the bond market equation. He's already shown his disdain for Yellen, and there have been reports that she doesn't plan to leave that post if Trump is elected.    A fight for control over the Fed - while the dream of every columnist - would be tough on bond investors.    n  Oil prices will decline if Trump is elected - good for consumers, not so good for investors in the stuff.    That's straightforward. Trump has vowed to pump as much oil as possible in the US and make the country even more energy self-sufficient.    n   You have to be very sophisticated to invest in the US dollar. But in the end, it either goes up or down.    The minute Trump wins, the dollar will react to his threats regarding trade deals. This is all very tricky, but here's how it was explained to me.    Because the US has a trade deficit, our dollars end up in the hands of other countries. To be safe, those countries hedge - essentially buy insurance - against a decline in all the dollars they have accumulated.    If Trump wins and the dollar starts to fall, all those countries holding massive amounts of our currency will have to buy dollars to cover their shorts.     So the dollar could rise if Trump is elected - except if foreign investors see him as a possibly reckless leader. Then the dollar will lose its value as a "safe haven" in an otherwise unpredictable world.    Donald Trump is gaining in the polls, and an anti-Hillary Clinton November surprise is still expected. So if Trump wins on Nov. 8, here's what investors could expect: 
November 18, 2016	 The New York Post	  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe went to Trump Tower on Thursday, seeking clarity on the president-elect's positions on international trade agreements and US-Asian alliances.    Faced with a nuclear-armed and unpredictable North Korea and a newly assertive China, both Japan and South Korea rely on US leadership and close military, diplomatic and trade ties with Washington.    If Donald Trump calls the relationship into question - as he did repeatedly on the campaign stump - it could mark a historic geopolitical shift.    Abe arrived at the Fifth Avenue skyscraper in late afternoon and entered through a side entrance, avoiding reporters.  ,   
February 18, 2016	 The New York Post	  Apple CEO Tim Cook vowed Wednesday to fight a federal court order to unlock California terrorist Syed Rizwan Farook's iPhone - setting the stage for an epic battle between law-enforcement agencies and privacy advocates.    The unprecedented clash could affect millions of cellphone users across the United States by opening what Cook called a "back door" into iPhones that hold ­everything from banking passwords to embarrassing photos.    "In the wrong hands, this software - which does not exist ­today - would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession," Cook warned in an open letter to Apple customers.     "The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices."    The outcome will ripple across the globe, with Russia, China and other authoritarian governments the big winners if Apple fails to overturn the order handed down late Tuesday.    "Why in the world would our government want to give repressive regimes in Russia and China a blueprint for forcing American companies to create a back door?" US Sen. Ron Wyden ­(D-Ore.), a leader on tech and privacy issues, told the Guardian.    The case involves an employer-issued iPhone 5C carried by ­Farook, a homegrown ISIS supporter who went on a December shooting rampage with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., before the couple was gunned down in a shootout with cops.    California US Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym, a former federal prosecutor, sided with the Justice Department, which said investigators had been stymied by encryption software on Farook's iPhone that is instructed to erase its data after 10 consecutive unsuccessful attempts to unlock it.    Federal agents want to retrace the couple's movements between the time of the massacre and their deaths - and learn if they got outside help.    Pym ordered Apple to create special software so the FBI could bypass the self-destruct feature, along with a "unique identifier" to prevent it from being used to unlock other iPhones.    Pym also gave Apple five days to appeal her order. As a jurist on the lowest rung of the federal-court system, her ruling can't set a binding precedent without ­being affirmed by higher courts.    Google CEO Sundar Pichai sided with business rival Cook, tweeting: "We build secure products to keep your information safe and we give law enforcement access to data based on valid legal orders.    "But that's wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices and data. Could be a troubling precedent," he added.    But NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton hailed Pym's decision, saying that "the right to privacy is not a total right in the sense that if it is being used for criminal purposes, that's where the courts come into play."    Donald Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, also said he agreed "100 percent with the courts."    "It's ridiculous that the government has to be put in a position where if they have information about a possible attack, we waste a second," he said.    Gary Miliefsky of SnoopWall, a counter-cyber-crime company that works with police departments, governments and banks, among others, predicted disaster if Apple lost the case.    "The iPhone is a Cadillac with six air bags. If they back-door it, they've turned it into a Ford Pinto," Miliefsky said.    'The US government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a back door to the iPhone. - Apple CEO Tim Cook    The federal government and Apple CEO Tim Cook are warring over privacy laws as officials seek access to California terrorist Syed Rizwan Farook's iPhone.    * Believes "the technique could be used over and over again" Warns the software is "too dangerous to create" and will compromise personal information and put personal safety at risk 
June 29, 2016	 The New York Post	  In an economic address Tuesday in Monessen, Pa., the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said it was time for the American people to "take back their future" as British people did by voting to exit the European Union.     "Our friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy, politics and borders," he said.     "I was on the right side of that issue - with the people - while Hillary, as always, stood with the elites, and both she and President Obama" advocated for the losing side.    The mogul rolled out a revised slogan - "Make America Wealthy Again" - and blamed globalization for costing the United States millions of jobs that "totally wiped out our middle class."    He cited the North America Free Trade Agreement signed by President Bill Clinton and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization during the Clinton administration.  
July 31, 2016	 The New York Post	  Democrats cheered President Obama's speech for Hillary Clinton last week, and rightly so: It was a stem-winder. Too bad those same delegates also roundly rejected his last major initiative - the Trans-Pacific Partnership.     "No TPP" signs were some of the most common on the convention floor, and the party platform strongly opposes the treaty.    Clinton came out against TPP (which she'd long favored) during the primaries as she moved left to fend off Bernie Sanders.    Yet Democrats have been moving against free trade for decades now. In remarks to New York delegates last week, Sen. Chuck Schumer - who in January takes over as Senate Democratic leader - recalled how he'd turned down then-President Bill Clinton's personal entreaty to support NAFTA back in the 1990s.    Indeed, Obama needed lots of Republican votes to even get the authority to negotiate the final TPP treaty - which he considers vital not only to boosting the US economy but to building a stronger Pacific alliance to contain China's dangerous regional ambitions.    But Democrats still refuse to support the president on TPP, while GOP nominee Donald Trump has been bashing it from the start of his campaign.    None of this means it's dead: Trump insists he's not anti-trade; he just wants to negotiate deals that are better for America.    And Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe - a TPP supporter and close Clinton ally - caused a stink mid-convention by suggesting that a President Hillary Clinton might flip back to supporting the deal with a few cosmetic changes.    The Clinton camp went all-out to deny McAuliffe's claim. Whether you believe that, we suppose, depends on how much you trust Hillary - who's going to have to abandon at least a few of her current promises if she's going to have an economic-growth agenda.    It would help, of course, if the president made a real effort to change Democratic minds on the issue. 
September 18, 2016	 The New York Post	  We interrupt our regular dispatches on mendacity, chaos and polarization to bring you this special bulletin: Good news is breaking out across the country! True story.    Despite a push from the American wing of the anti-American movement to get traitor Edward Snowden a pardon, nobody holding important power is buying it. Not the president, not the Congress and neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump.     They all demand that Snowden come in from the Russian cold to face criminal charges under the Espionage Act, making this a rare moment of national political unity. It is a thing of beauty worth celebrating, all the more so because the stakes are so high.      Imagine if it were a partisan wedge issue. Even a crack in the wall would give fuel to an idea that is extremely dangerous to America's national security.    That was the message sent by the House Intelligence Committee, which unanimously adopted a report saying Snowden "did tremendous damage." In a bipartisan letter, the panel scoffed at claims Snowden was a hero who acted out of conscience, saying he was a disgruntled employee whose leaks of military programs helped America's enemies.     The panel said it agreed with President Obama's statement three years ago that "I don't think Mr. Snowden was a patriot."    Thankfully, Obama is holding firm, with press secretary Josh Earnest telling reporters that "Snowden is not a whistleblower," adding that "his conduct put American lives at risk . . . and the policy of the Obama administration is that Mr. Snowden should return to the United States and face the very serious charges."     The spark for the sudden interest is Oliver Stone's movie lionizing Snowden. The crackpot caucus, including George Soros, Susan Sarandon, Noam Chomsky, Cornel West and so-called human-rights groups, is using the film to demand the pardon and turn Snowden into a hero.    Their arguments turn truth upside down. The head of the American Civil Liberties Union claimed that cases like this one "are precisely why the presidential pardon power exists," while an Amnesty International official said, "We will need more Edward Snowdens."     Ah, no on both counts. The vast majority of presidential pardons are granted only after conviction and after the applicant has served most, if not all, of his prison sentence. Because Snowden fled rather than "face the music" as Hillary Clinton put it, he doesn't deserve even the courtesy of consideration.    And the last thing we need are more Snowdens. Letting him off without paying a price would encourage more treasonous behavior.    After he had already bolted, Snowden was charged in 2013 with theft, "unauthorized communication of national defense information" and "willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person."     He scurried first to Hong Kong, then to Vladimir Putin's Russia. He's still living there under asylum, which Putin granted to embarrass America, and almost certainly to learn everything Snowden knew.     Against that history, the claims of Snowden and his confederates that he performed a public service are laughable. Unless, of course, he meant public service to Russia, China, Iran and Islamic State, the beneficiaries of his disclosures.     Innocent Americans, meanwhile, were put at risk, and taxpayers had to pay many billions to develop new intelligence programs to replace those Snowden revealed.     At a time when national unity is usually an oxymoron, it is heartening that national security remains at least partially sacrosanct. In addition to the united front against Snowden, Trump and Clinton halted their campaigns for the anniversary of 9/11, just as previous candidates did.    Those actions prove that America remains capable of pulling together to get the big things right. Raise a glass to more of that. 
October 21, 2016	 The New York Post	  Hillary Clinton solicited a $12 million donation from a government her State Department called corrupt, then later realized the "mess" it would cause to her presidential run, ­e-mails reveal.    King Mohammed VI of Morocco agreed to give the money to the Clinton Foundation, provided that it hold a convention in his country in May 2015 with Clinton the keynote speaker.     But Clinton realized that the conference, slated for a month after she announced her run for president, would hurt her candidacy.     "No matter what happens, she will be in Morocco hosting CGI [Clinton Global Initiative] on May 5-7, 2015. Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this," top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to campaign manager Robby Mook in a November 2014 e-mail revealed by Wiki­Leaks.    In another e-mail, Abedin warned that if Clinton didn't attend the summit, the $12 million would be off the table, and that Clinton "created this mess and she knows it."    "Just to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter," Abedin wrote in a January 2015 ­e-mail to Mook and campaign manager John ­Podesta.    "CGI also wasn't pushing for a meeting in Morocco and it wasn't their first choice. This was HRC's idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx $12 million both for the [foundation's] endowment and to support the meeting," Abedin continued.    "It will break a lot of china to back out now when we had so many opportunities to do it in the past few months. She created this mess and she knows it."    The king gave the money to the Clinton Foundation and underwrote the CGI summit with the quid-pro-quo understanding that Hillary would attend, and other dignitaries attending were led to believe that she would be there.     But Hillary sent Bill and Chelsea Clinton to represent the family while she campaigned in Nevada and California.    It was unclear how much went directly for the summit and how much went to the Clinton Foundation - but the total added up to $12 million, according to the e-mails.    Guests at the May 2015 CGI summit - which was closed to the media - stayed at the five-star Selman-Marrakesh hotel, a posh lodging featuring a stable of Arabian horses and luxury amenities.    The meeting was officially paid for by OCP, a Moroccan-government-owned mining company that has been accused of human-rights violations.     Clinton supported the monarch when she was secretary of state, and the US-financed Export-Import Bank gave OCP a $92 million loan guarantee during her tenure, The Daily Caller reported.    Politico reported in 2015 that Clinton "was seen by [Morocco capital] Rabat as among its staunchest supporters in the Obama administration." The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice charged OCP with "serious human-rights violations," including exploitation of workers by not "adequately compensating the impoverished people who live there," the Daily Caller said.    And Mohamed Yeslem Beisat, the Washington envoy for the self-described "government in exile" Polisario Front, told US News & World Report in April 2013 that "OCP is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation - it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past 40 years."    "They're doing this because they know Hillary has some chances of being president of the United States. And they want her to support their brutal occupation of Western Sahara," Beisat told the magazine.     Human-rights advocates have called the company's mined phosphates "blood phosphates" - similar to the term "blood diamonds," referring to precious stones mined in war zones and/or used to finance deadly conflicts.     The e-mails were stolen from the account of Podesta, who has warned that the communications may have been doctored.    US intelligence agencies have fingered the Russian government as the culprits behind the hack - charging that Russian President and Donald Trump supporter Vladimir Putin was trying to influence the US election in Trump's favor.    In Wednesday's final presidential debate, Trump insisted - without offering evidence - that "no one knows" who hacked the ­e-mails.    Clinton slammed her opponent for using the purloined e-mails to attack her, as well as his past statements encouraging the Russians to hack her own e-mails from when she was secretary of state. 
October 21, 2016	 The New York Post	  Hillary Clinton wrangled a fat $12 million donation from the King of Morocco last year in exchange for her scheduling and attending the annual summit of her family foundation's Clinton Global Initiative in that country - but she never showed up despite pocketing the cash.    Top Clinton aide Huma Abedin bluntly said in a November 2014 e-mail that the ex-secretary of state would attend the May 2015 summit in Marrakesh at the behest of Moroccan King Mohammed VI.     "No matter what happens, she will be in Morocco hosting CGI on May 5-7, 2015. Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this," Abedin wrote to top Clintonista Robby Mook.

November 5, 2016	 The New York Post	  Biologists in North Carolina have confirmed the presence there of "zombie bees": parasitized insects that display erratic behavior.    Experts determined some local honeybees had been infested with fly larvae and were having their brains and organs eaten from the inside out.     A Florida man called 911 after being locked out of his hotel room and told cops his 4-year-old daughter was choking on candy, urging them to send an ambulance as soon as they could.    When officers arrived and opened the door, they discovered that the Fort Meyers resident was alone and he promptly confessed to making the false report.    A new step for mom's china: The owner of a New Mexico cremation company turns human remains into dishware.    "I collected the bones of 200 people and created a ceramic glaze using that," said Justin Crowe of Nourish. "The project was made to infuse a sense or mortality in everyday moments of life."    Officials in El Paso, Texas, admitted this week that they were duped by a phishing e-mail scam that tricked them into sending $3.2 million in city funds to fake bank accounts.    A radical right-wing group in India has already declared Donald Trump the winner of the US presidential election - and they chose to celebrate Friday.    Members of the Hindu Sena, or Army of Hindus, banged on drums and sang songs proclaiming that the Republican candidate had "already won."    "Trump's victory is confirmed early, due to his thoughts against Islamic terrorism and love for India and Hindus," said Vishnu Gupta, Hindu Sena's national president.

Investigators reopening the case. Supposed facts overlooked. Updated forensics, DNA data, weapon examination. Hourlong what-might-have-really-happened episodes.     It's got a forensic psychologist, police sergeant, investigator probing what's labeled "new" evidence: content from the infamous Bronco, blood spatter, potential eyewitness, etc. And, this being your lucky day, even America's best houseguest Kato Kaelin.    I've done hundreds of mentions, articles, Page Ones dealing with this 20-plus-year-old horror. I knew the players. I knew of the drugs. I reported prostitutes claiming he'd abused them. I named those involved hustling book publishers. November '94, I wrote, "Nicole said she knew O.J. would eventually kill her."    While reporters kvetch more about Russia than America, Joe Biden saying, "Stop already, it's over," has made those canceling DC's longtime historic inaugural party now feel guilty. "We should've given Trump a chance. We should've given the party. Sorry we didn't," they told me.    And while masses pack tuxes for ballrooms and boots for parades, our ­Emperor-elect remains a calm presence.

January 18, 2017	 The New York Post	  Less than a week after Scaramucci accepted an advisory role in President-elect Donald Trump's administration, Scaramucci's SkyBridge Capital announced that it has been sold to the US-based arm of China's HNA Capital and lesser-known Washington, DC-based RON Transatlantic for a reported $200 million.      That's despite the fact that when asked by The Post in November if he would consider leaving SkyBridge to serve Trump full time, Scaramucci said, "This is like you would be asking me to leave my local bodega," before admitting he'd have a hard time turning down the president.    "The value may be lower than otherwise given Scaramucci's short time frame," attorney Martin Sklar of Kleinberg Kaplan told The Post.    Sklar explained that it is common to use a percentage of assets under management, usually 2 percent, as a starting point in conjunction with other factors when valuing a fund.     On top of running Skybridge, Scaramucci also has a stake in the SALT Conference, an annual hedge fund bacchanalia held in Las Vegas. Skybridge said that under terms of the sale agreement, the conference would be spun out as a "standalone entity."    Separately, ahead of Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross' Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday, the Office of Government Ethics posted Ross' federal financial disclosure statement Tuesday.     The form revealed Ross' art collection, which is said to be worth more than $50 million, as well as the famed investor's other investments.  
January 17, 2017	 The New York Post	  It's no surprise Donald Trump's pushback against Rep. John Lewis' charge that he's an "illegitimate president" has caused a furor. But, asks Byron York in the Washington Examiner, how many Democrats agree with Lewis? So far, the response has been mixed: "Some openly disagree with Lewis. Others disagree but don't want to say so explicitly. Still others agree but don't want to say so explicitly. And some wholeheartedly support Lewis." Even Bernie Sanders refused to sign on to the "illegitimate" claim. Because for some Democrats, it "would move them a bit too close to a kind of birtherism that they spent years denouncing." Indeed, "if anyone other than John Lewis were leading the legitimacy fight, even more Democrats might distance themselves from it."    The first step toward correcting a problem "is admitting you have one," says Noah Rothman at Commentary, adding: "The left isn't there yet." Case in point: Human Rights Watch, which has just declared Donald Trump a threat to global human rights. Of course, this is all speculative, since Trump "hasn't taken office yet," so "nothing has happened." And a close look shows these complaints to be "hollow partisanship," since the "threats" include appointing pro-life judges and repealing ObamaCare. Which means "it isn't Trump who represents a threat to human rights in HRW's estimation but conservatism." So, like that Harvard study "which laughably determined that North Carolina is today less free and democratic than North Korea, Human Rights Watch has given its critics ample justification to ignore its findings."     The confirmation process of Education Secretary-designate Betsy DeVos, according to the National Review's John Fund, will "test the reform bona fides of New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker, a school-choice supporter who has served with DeVos on the board of a school-choice group." In his two terms as mayor of Newark, he "expanded charter schools." But now that he's eyeing a run for president, Booker "suddenly has 'serious concerns' about DeVos, despite having worked closely with her in the past," for fear of "withering fire from the powerful teachers' unions." If Booker rejects DeVos, "he will not only have given the school-choice movement he has championed a slap in the face, he will also have called into question the reputation he had of being a liberal problem-solver."    Washington Post Editorial-Page Editor Fred Hiatt says Donald Trump "is not all wrong about China" - which gives him "an opportunity to reshape what, if not handled carefully, could become the world's most dangerous bilateral relationship." Though wrong on some specifics, Trump's "underlying message of basic unfairness was right. China is not operating by the same rules as everyone else." Yet "initiating a trade war, by slapping tariffs on Chinese products, would likely harm Chinese and Americans alike without accomplishing much." So Trump "should insist on more reciprocity in economic relations, but consistent with fairness and principles of economic freedom, not simply to gain an upper hand." That would benefit "American workers and firms," but mostly "the Chinese people."    It'd be easy to call Donald Trump's transition "a mess for the president-elect," says Matthew Cooper at Newsweek, but for one thing: "Trump is getting what he wants." He notes, "it's unlikely any of his cabinet nominees will be rejected by the Senate." Yes, several "nominees took issue with some of Trump's enunciated positions." But Trump has backed off some of his more controversial stances, so "the differences between what his nominees stated and what Trump has stated isn't as great as had been implied." Moreover, "on any number of other issues, Trump is likely to get enough of what he wants to claim victory." So "he looks poised for a lot of victories, despite critics underestimating him, which, come to think of it, sounds pretty familiar."  
December 26, 2016	 The New York Post	  A furious Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday summoned America's Israeli ambassador to Jerusalem to protest the surprise US failure to block a United Nations anti-settlement resolution.    Israel's Foreign Ministry also demanded visits from the ambassadors of the countries that voted in favor of the resolution, including those from the permanent members of the Security Council - Russia, China, the UK and France.     The State Department said in a brief statement Sunday that Prime Minister Netanyahu and US Ambassador Dan Shapiro were to meet Sunday night. Reports confirmed the meeting took place, but did not offer any details.     Israel has accused President Obama - who broke with longstanding US policy toward its close ally - of colluding with the Palestinians against the Jewish state.    "From the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed," Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday.    Netanyahu said his nation was considering a "plan of action" against the UN, without elaborating. Israel had earlier pledged to cut millions in funding to some UN agencies.    "We will do all it takes so Israel emerges unscathed from this shameful decision," Netanyahu said.    The resolution, which condemned Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, sparked outrage in Israel and led to a new low in the tepid relationship between Netanyahu and Obama.     Yet Netanyahu urged Likud ministers to stop criticizing Obama because he was worried the lame-duck Democrat could take further action to hurt Israel before he is replaced by Donald Trump on Jan. 20, The Jerusalem Post reported.    But Culture Minister Miri Regev told Army Radio that Obama let the anti-settlement resolution pass because "his ego overcame his brains," the paper said.    Meanwhile, Jerusalem's planning committee is reportedly set to approve 390 new apartment units in disputed neighborhoods. 
December 26, 2016	 The New York Post	  A furious Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday summoned America's ambassador to Jerusalem to protest the surprise US failure to block a United Nations anti-settlement resolution.    Israel's Foreign Ministry also demanded visits from the ambassadors of the countries that voted in favor of the resolution, including those from the permanent members of the Security Council - Russia, China, the UK and France.     The State Department said in a brief statement Sunday that Netanyahu and US Ambassador Dan Shapiro were to meet Sunday night, without releasing further details.    But Israeli media said it was unclear when the sitdown would take place, and neither Netanyahu nor the White House provided any further details.    Israel has accused President Obama - who broke with longstanding policy toward its close ally - of colluding with the Palestinians against the Jewish state.    "From the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed," Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday.    Netanyahu said the Jewish state was considering a "plan of action" against the UN, without elaborating. Israel had earlier pledged to cut millions in funding to some UN agencies.    "We will do all it takes so Israel emerges unscathed from this shameful decision," Netanyahu said.    The resolution, which condemned Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, sparked outrage in Israel and led to a new low in relations between Netanyahu and Obama.     Netanyahu urged Likud ministers to stop criticizing Obama because he was worried the lame-duck Democrat could take further action to hurt Israel before he is replaced by Donald Trump on Jan. 20, The Jerusalem Post reported.    But Culture Minister Miri Regev told Army Radio that Obama let the anti-settlement resolution pass because "his ego overcame his brains," the paper said.    "I wasn't surprised by the actions of the Americans or the UN, because they were never our friends," Regev said.    Regional Cooperation Minister Tzachi Hanegbi, the most moderate Likud minister, told reporters at the Prime Minister's Office that Israel felt betrayed by Obama.    "Thankfully, in 25 more days, the administration responsible for this horrible decision will be forced off the stage," Hanegbi said.    "I believe the next administration will clean this decision that stained the Obama administration. Obama surrendered to the Iranians, abandoned the Syrians, and stuck a knife in the backs of the Israelis."    Meanwhile, Jerusalem's planning committee is reportedly set to approve 390 new apartment units in disputed neighborhoods. 
December 28, 2016	 The New York Post	  Israel is "temporarily reducing" ties with 10 countries that voted for the UN Security Council resolution demanding a halt to settlement building in the Palestinian territories, the nation's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.     Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon refuted reports that Israel was suspending ties with the countries, but said his nation was "temporarily reducing" visits and work with embassies, Agence France-Presse reported.    The countries targeted by Israel are Britain, France, Russia, China, Japan, Ukraine, Angola, Egypt, Uruguay and Spain.    "We'll limit our contacts with the embassies here in Israel and refrain from visits of Israeli officials to those states, and of visits of officials from those states here," Nahshon told AFP.     The diplomatic discord is the result of Friday's vote, in which 14 of 15 Security Council members demanded "Israel immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem."    Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Tuesday that he hoped a Mideast conference in France on Jan. 15 would set a timetable for independence.    "The decision [at the UN] lays the foundation for any future serious negotiation . . . and it paves the way for the international peace conference slated to be held in Paris," Abbas said.    Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly called on Abbas to meet for direct talks without preconditions.     Despite the resolution, Israel is moving ahead with plans for thousands of new homes in East Jerusalem, where Palestinians want to establish their capital.     Palestinians claim the West Bank and East Jerusalem - home to Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites- as theirs.    Israel's government is banking on support from the Trump administration to undo the damage - saying again Tuesday it had "ironclad" evidence from Arab sources that the White House helped craft the resolution.    Meanwhile, Bronx Congressman Eliot Engel told NY1, "We were all kind of blindsided" by President Obama's move."

April 13, 2016	 The New York Post	  Mark Zuckerberg took thinly veiled swipes at Donald Trump and the two largest Asian countries on Tuesday, blasting all for talk of "building walls."    "I hear fearful voices talking about building walls," the 31-year-old tech billionaire said as he took the stage at Facebook's annual F8 developer conference in San Francisco. "Instead of building walls, we can build bridges."     But as the Facebook chief hammered at his familiar ambition to "connect the world," the real targets were China's authoritarian government, which has stubbornly resisted Facebook's expansion there, as well as telecom regulators in India.     "I'm starting to see people and nations turning inward against this idea of a connected world," Zuckerberg griped, saying unnamed authorities were "blocking free expression, reducing trade and even in some areas reducing access to the internet."    Zuckerberg also touted new "chatbots" that companies' apps can use to interact with clients on Facebook's Messenger, which has grown to 900 million monthly active users.    Portraying the process of downloading and using separate mobile apps as cumbersome, Zuckerberg claimed buying shoes and ordering an Uber will be easier through Messenger.    "To order flowers, you never have to call 1-800-Flowers again," Zuckerberg said, demonstrating how the flower-delivery giant had integrated its service into Messenger, allowing a user to browse and order flowers directly through the texting service.     Zuckerberg also highlighted Facebook's latest efforts in virtual reality, telling attendees that eventually Oculus' bulky headset will be replaced by a device that looks like an ordinary pair of glasses.     The VR goggles of the future could also perform tricks with AR, or "augmented reality," which enhances a user's visual field with virtual images. 
June 16, 2016	 The New York Post	  Once the watershed for "Let me be perfectly clear . . . I am not a crook . . . ," the newly exquisite hotel reopened Tuesday after Euro Capital's $125 million scrub. The jammed debut outnumbered those who bid adieu to Richard Milhous.    Amid staffers in Emmywinning "Mad Men" costume designer's uniforms, against an ultramod, curved, undulating copper wall with customcurled silver lamps, former Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, twotime GOP nominee (for vice president in '76, and president in '96), told me:     "I've spoken with Donald Trump. Once he called me, once I called him. I like him. Two weeks ago, I said I'd be his senior adviser - but to be president of the United States, he has to tone it down. Getting things done in Washington means working with both sides of the House.    "Yes, this country can be No. 1 again. I am encouraged with the new generation. Look, I remember we had problems with our generation.    "Both candidates are flawed. But this is the year to run. Sound bites are easy. Problem is, you have to back them up. Donald needs solid people. He's never been in politics, but he can do it." Dole's wife, Elizabeth, stunning in a designer suit and heels, stood inside a herd of wash 'n' wear partying locals as Sen. Dole said: "I'm going to the convention. My friends want me to be there.    'Your age is not a factor. You have a sound voice. But if the economy is good, you cannot beat Bill Clinton. Your campaign cannot suggest things mightn't improve. Saying things could get worse is not a winner.' "Donald's got a big following. Republicans like the guy but feel he's gone too far. He can win.    He's just got to tone it down." And why is Dole at the reopening of this National Registry of Historic Places hotel, which once housed bodies like Elizabeth Taylor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Martha Mitchell and Nixon's secretary Rose Mary Woods, who somehow couldn't account for 18 minutes of her boss' erased tape?    "I love the Watergate Hotel. It will be great again. We have a lot to do. We'll all be great again."     "My mom never saw a tag sale she didn't like. Of her thousands of glossy, ornate, rococo objects, she said, 'It's what Marie Antoinette would've had if she'd had any taste.' About Louis XVI cream and pink painted chairs that upheld Wendy Williams' rear, she said: 'My own ass has been on every seat.'     "Tons of china, service for all New York, like for when Nancy Reagan came. Frames, objects, boxes, books, tables, Fabergé. Mom once gave me notes for friends. Her red chinchilla jacket to you, large vase to Deborah Norville.' One big-ticket item, maybe $150,000, will be her mahogany commode." Who peed in it? "I can't say exactly but, trust me, it's for an older, large prostate."    Melissa is then in Washington, DC, to open and close the Kennedy Center's Joan Rivers Tribute and preserve forever Joan's Master Joke File.     As for settling the medical claim surrounding her mother's death, minus a deposition or protracted lawsuit: "I have that minute-by-minute log. The outcome could not be different. My son did not need to relive that horror. Nor can I live through that pain. Those who need to assume responsibility did."    Overheard in the Hamptons: "You can overnight in the Lincoln Bedroom or do a flyover in Air Force One, providing your wallet is considered carry-on luggage. 
August 28, 2016	 The New York Post	  Dear John: I'm trying to help my daughter get a mortgage. She's in the midst of a messy divorce. Her soon-to-be ex hasn't worked (or looked for a job for that matter) in two years.    She's a very hard worker. Makes good money and is a great mother. She had maintained great credit and is a highly regarded employee with great potential.     In the midst of the divorce, their mortgage payment fell behind 120 days. This happened only one time. That's what's killing her.    All payments have been current for six months. She's found a house and wants to bid but needs a mortgage pre-approval, which she can't get. She's trying to start a new life for her kids and herself. She will have 20 percent to put down.    And by "we" I mean Billy Procida, a financier and head of Procida Funding & Advisors, which is based in Englewood Cliffs, NJ. Procida is a New York City guy whom I met a few months ago when his rock band was playing at the Highline Ballroom. How's that for luck?    His company does business in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York. Your needs were well below what Procida usually finances but, as a favor to me, he put you in touch with some mortgage companies. And you recently told me you have a couple to choose from and that the only delay at this point is on your end.     Dear F.U. Sir, punctuation and sentence structure are so important in a letter like this since you - obviously - want to be thought of as a thoughtful, level-headed guy.     So please be more careful next time. But I do like the multiple exclamation points at the end to show passion.    The trouble is, I don't know if you are replying to my analysis of the employment numbers or my column about how the National Security Agency has copies of what are likely to be e-mails that are very embarrassing to Hillary Clinton.     For us to have an educated, grown-up conversation, like I'm sure you are seeking, I obviously need to know what bug is up your a**.     Dear John: I loved your idea two years ago on this topic of allowing US companies to repatriate profits at a lower tax rate.    I'm glad Trump is bringing it up now (although it gets buried by his stupid statement of the day shtick). You should also note to your readers that this could be repeated going forward, as US companies are making money overseas every day.    My business is actually looking seriously at bringing production back from China to simplify our supply chain. I'm sure a lot of US manufacturers would give this a closer look if, in addition to this repatriation tax break, we lowered corporate tax rates or provided tax credits to companies that were "onshoring." J.S.   Trump's pal Carl Icahn also backs the repatriation idea. So if this guy actually gets elected, you might get your wish.  
October 21, 2016	 The New York Post	  Hillary Clinton solicited a $12 million donation from a government her State Department considered corrupt, then realized the "mess" it would cause to her presidential run, a newly leaked ­e-mail reveals.    King Mohammed VI of Morocco agreed to give the money to the Clinton Foundation, provided that it hold a convention in his country in May 2015 with Clinton as the keynote speaker.     But Clinton realized that the conference, slated for a month after she announced her run for president, would hurt her candidacy.     "No matter what happens, she will be in Morocco hosting CGI [Clinton Global Initiative] on May 5-7, 2015. Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this," top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to campaign manager Robby Mook in a November 2014 e-mail revealed by Wiki­Leaks.    In another e-mail, Abedin warned that if Clinton didn't attend, the $12 million would be off the table.    "Just to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter," Abedin wrote in a January 2015 ­e-mail to Mook and campaign manager John ­Podesta.    "CGI also wasn't pushing for a meeting in Morocco and it wasn't their first choice. This was HRC's idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx $12 million both for the [foundation's] endowment and to support the meeting," Abedin continued.    "It will break a lot of china to back out now when we had so many opportunities to do it in the past few months. She created this mess and she knows it."    The king gave the money to the Clinton Foundation and underwrote the CGI summit with the quid-pro-quo understanding that Hillary would attend, and other dignitaries attending were led to believe that she would be there.     The deal with Morocco was struck even though the State Department - under Hillary Clinton - accused the country's government of "arbitrary arrests and corruption," according to Fox News.     It was unclear exactly how much went directly for the summit and how much went to the Clinton Foundation - but the total added up to $12 million, according to the e-mails.    Guests at the May 2015 CGI summit - which was closed to the media - stayed at the five-star Selman-Marrakesh hotel, a posh lodging featuring a stable of Arabian horses and luxury amenities.    The meeting was officially paid for by OCP, a Moroccan-government-owned mining company that has been accused of human-rights violations.     Hillary Clinton supported the monarch when she was secretary of state, and the US-financed Export-Import Bank gave OCP a $92 million loan guarantee during her tenure, The Daily Caller reported.    Politico reported in 2015 that Clinton "was seen by [the Moroccan capital] Rabat as among its staunchest supporters in the Obama administration."     The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice charged OCP with "serious human-rights violations," the Daily Caller said.    And Mohamed Yeslem Beisat, the Washington envoy for the self-described "government in exile" Polisario Front, told US News & World Report in April 2013 that "OCP is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation - it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past 40 years."    Beisat added, "They're doing this because they know Hillary has some chances of being president of the United States. And they want her to support their brutal occupation of Western Sahara."      Human-rights advocates have called the company's mined phosphates "blood phosphates" - similar to the term "blood diamonds," referring to precious stones mined in war zones and/or used to finance deadly conflicts.    US intelligence agencies have fingered the Russian government as the culprits behind the hack - charging that Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to influence the US election in Donald Trump's favor.    In Wednesday's final presidential debate, Trump insisted - without offering evidence - that "no one knows" who hacked the ­e-mails.    Clinton slammed her opponent for using the purloined e-mails to attack her, as well as for his past statements encouraging the Russians to hack her e-mails from when she was secretary of state. 
March 17, 2016	 The New York Post	  Eloise had better get ready for a new landlord - the historic Plaza hotel will hit the auction block next month, according to a ­report Wednesday.    The foreclosure auction was triggered after 75 percent owner Sahara India Pariwar - an Indian conglomerate whose chairman was imprisoned in 2014 for defrauding investors - defaulted on loan agreements, Bloomberg News reported.     A second luxury hotel property, the Dream Downtown, located near the High Line in Chelsea, will be sold with The Plaza as part of a package, the report said.    The two properties' mortgage is currently held by billionaire brothers David and Simon Reuben, who have reportedly scheduled a foreclosure auction for April 26.    Built in 1907, the five-star Plaza has 282 hotel rooms and 152 privately owned condo units. But only the hotel, restaurants and retail shops will be sold.     The Reubens have been talking about an auction for a long time without actually putting mallet to block, skeptical hotel-industry insiders told The Post on Wednesday. But if the auction occurs, the price could top $1 billion, they said.    "The Baccarat just went for $2 million a key," one hotel developer told The Post of the new West 53rd Street luxury hotel, which sold for $230 million last month to a China-based ­insurance group.    "The Plaza will likely go for more," as much as $3 million a key or more, "due to its trophy location on Fifth Avenue and its history," the source said.     "It's been a dirty little secret that The Plaza has been headed to foreclosure," an industry source said, adding that "there are some offers in the wings."    The Plaza - and its famous, fictional resident, children's-book character Eloise - has had many owners, including Donald Trump. 
January 18, 2017	 The New York Post	  Much of liberal America is in an absolute tizzy over his impending presidency, with denunciations and declarations of defiance competing for the most apocalyptic scenarios. Will the world end Friday or Saturday?    The sturm und drang is not limited to the homefront. Europe is reeling from Trump's salvo that Brexit is a "good thing" and NATO is "obsolete." And China threatens to "take off the gloves" if Trump keeps flirting with Taiwan.     But if the president-elect is rattled or even worried about the turmoil, he's doing a masterful job of concealing it.    Days from his inauguration, Trump was the calmest man in America. Smiling, gracious, making jokes, laughing at mine, tossing off asides to an aide - if you didn't know what he's been through and the awesome responsibility he's about to assume, you never would have guessed it.    To be sure, he was hardly oblivious or giddy. It was the holiday for Martin Luther King Jr. and the papers were filled with stories of Trump's dispute with civil-rights icon John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat. Lewis started the row by saying he would boycott the inauguration because he sees Trump as an "illegitimate president," which is a shockingly cheap shot.     Yet, predictably, most journalists hammered Trump's counterpunch, a tweet that said Lewis "should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart." Predictably again, Trump was accused of being racially insensitive to a black hero on the day that honors Martin Luther King Jr.     "So unfair," Trump said, referring to The New York Times' tilted story, which led the front page. "It's really dishonest."    His tone was more matter-of-fact than outraged, and it occurred to me that this was in contrast to his Twitter personality, which gives the impression that he is almost always angry. The platform might serve him better if he used it more often as a happy warrior.     My personal experience with Trump is limited, but I have known many public figures who would have spent days curled in the fetal position if they had taken half the pounding he's endured the last 18 months. Even a single false accusation of racial insensitivity would have sent most to the medicine cabinet and the bottle.     Then there's that new life Trump starts Friday at noon. Maybe it hasn't hit him yet, but he shows no sign of being intimidated about becoming the most powerful man in the world, #45 in the line that starts with George Washington and includes Abraham Lincoln, FDR, JFK and Ronald Reagan.    He showed some spark when he mentioned his meeting with the head of Lockheed-Martin about the soaring cost of the F-35 aircraft. I asked if it was true the company had offered $600 million in reduced costs. He nodded yes and said, "We saved $600 million in half an hour's work."    I started with President Obama's latest poison pill, of having the Justice Department investigate FBI Director James Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton probe. I asked Trump if he would push to have the inspector general widen the review and examine all the evidence, including whether Clinton should have been indicted.    "We have not gotten into that yet," he said calmly, before saying Comey had treated Clinton "extremely well" by not recommending criminal charges.     I then raised the prospect of his being tested soon after taking office, saying it's almost a ritual that each new president gets tested by a foreign adversary. What do you expect and from where?    As I mentally raced through possibilities, he cut my speculation short. "I don't think we're going to be tested," he said. "I'm not a game player. They understand me."    "It's a terrible deal," he said. "Frankly, it's worse for Israel than it is us, but it's terrible."   China? "It will all be fine" he started benignly, before switching to the trade deals he pledged to fix or scuttle. "We have a big problem with China," he said, more emphatically. "They've been sapping our wealth through these horrible, horrible trade deals. Everybody takes advantage of us, but the trade deals are just so bad."    At that point, Peter Thiel, the entrepreneur and philanthropist, walked into the office, and after brief bantering, I stood up to leave. I wished Trump Godspeed and walked out, uncertain of what I had learned.     Later, it hit me - I had witnessed something important and wonderful. Donald Trump is a man at peace with his responsibility.    The next leader of America is standing strong in a world gone mad. Tested by fire, he is calm, confident and ready for action as he approaches his rendezvous with history. May God smile on his tenure.  
August 24, 2016	 The New York Post	  More than half the private citizens who got face time or spoke with Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state forked over bundles of cash to the Clinton Foundation, a new investigation revealed Tuesday.    At least 85 of the 154 nongovernment fat cats who got access to Clinton donated to her family charity or promised to back its programs, either personally or through businesses or other groups, according to a review of State Department documents by The Associated Press.     Combined, the donors shelled out as much as $156 million, with at least 40 donating more than $100,000 each and 20 giving more than $1 million - more evidence that the family's foundation doubled as a pay-for-play operation for those seeking access to Clinton, critics charge.     n  A famed economist who asked for her help as the Bangladeshi government pressured him to resign from a nonprofit bank.     n  Estée Lauder executives who met with Clinton while her department worked with the firm's corporate charity to counter gender-based violence in South Africa.    Analysts said the revelations offer further proof that State under Clinton was rife with conflicts of interest because of its deep ties to the foundation.    "The real conflicts of interest and appearances of conflicts are legion. This is proof positive the foundation should be shut if Clinton is elected president," Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, told The Post.    Donald Trump pounced on the revelations during a speech in Texas as further evidence of the Democratic nominee's shoddy ethics.    "America can never elect a candidate who, like Hillary Clinton, did government favors for those giving her family and her foundation massive amounts of cash," he said, calling the investigation's results "the tip of the iceberg."    Call logs show that Slim-Fast billionaire S. Daniel Abraham, a Clinton fund-raising bundler and foundation donor, was listed in her date books for eight meetings.     Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi economist who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for pioneering low-interest micro-credit for poor business owners, met with Clinton three times and spoke with her by phone during a period when the Bangladeshi government was investigating his oversight of a nonprofit bank.     Throughout the process, he pleaded for help in messages routed to Clinton, who ordered aides to find ways to assist him.    And after his meetings with Clinton, she warned the Bangladeshi government in a speech that "we do not want to see any action taken that would in any way undermine or interfere in the operations of the Grameen Bank."    In another case, Clinton was host at a September 2009 breakfast meeting at the New York Stock Exchange that listed Blackstone Group Chairman Stephen Schwarzman - a major foundation donor - as one of the attendees.      A day after the breakfast, according to Clinton's e-mails, the State Department was working on a visa issue at Schwarzman's request.    Blackstone donated between $250,000 and $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation, and eight Blackstone executives also gave between $375,000 and $800,000. And Blackstone's charitable arm has pledged millions of dollars in commitments to three Clinton Global Initiative projects.     Clinton also met in June 2011 with Nancy Mahon of MAC AIDS, the charitable arm of MAC Cosmetics, which is owned by Estée Lauder.     The meeting occurred before an announcement about a State Department partnership to raise money to finance AIDS education and prevention.     The public-private partnership was formed to fight gender-based violence in South Africa, State said at the time.    Estée Lauder executive Fabrizio Freda also met with Clinton at the same Wall Street event attended by Schwarzman.     Later that month, Freda was on a list of attendees for a meeting between Clinton and a US-China trade group.     State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said the agency was not aware of any agency actions that were influenced by the Clinton Foundation.    The 154 individuals who met or spoke to Clinton did not include federal employees or foreign government representatives.    The AP sought Clinton's calendar and schedules three years ago, but the department stonewalled so the wire service had to sue in federal court to get access to those materials and other records.    In another disclosure, Fox News reported that a senior executive at the foundation left almost 150 telephone messages over two years for Cheryl Mills, Clinton's top aide at the State Department.    A review of Mills' call logs shows at least 148 messages from Laura Graham, who was the Clinton Foundation's chief operating officer between 2010 and 2012.     No other individual or nonprofit appears in the logs with anything approaching that frequency or volume, according to the review of the documents, which were released to the conservative advocacy group Citizens United as part of a long-running lawsuit over a Freedom of Information Act request.    New details emerged Tuesday on the close ties between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton's State Department:     * At least 85 of the 154 nongovernment individuals who got access to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton donated to the Clinton Foundation or promised to back its programs.    * Combined, the donors shelled out as much as $156 million, with at least 40 donating more than $100,000 each and 20 forking over more than $1 million.    * Laura Graham, a senior executive at the foundation, left almost 150 telephone messages over two years for Cheryl Mills (left), Clinton's top aide at the State Department - more evidence of the close relationshipbetween the foundation and State.    * The Associated Press first sought Clinton's calendar and schedules three years ago, but State stonewalled and the wire service had to sue in federal court to get access to those materials and other records.  
September 27, 2016	 The New York Post	  There were too many words spoken in Monday night's presidential debate. I like it when the selling points are succinct - like they are on political buttons and bumper stickers, to wit: "Hillary Stands for Something When She Isn't Falling Down/ Trump '16," or "If Tr ump Wants a Great Wall, Send Him to China/Hillary '16."      In a great tradition that I began during the last presidential vote, here are some slogans I'd like to see:  
October 22, 2016	 The New York Post	  Hillary Clinton was finally asked a direct question at Wednesday's debate about the conflicts of interest between the Clinton Foundation and her work as secretary of state, but "more or less avoided the question," writes David A. Graham at The Atlantic. And Donald Trump "effectively let her off the hook," proving yet again that "she has gotten very lucky" in this election. Yet "the point of ethics guidelines is to avoid even the impression that there might be shady business, and in the case of the Clinton Foundation, that did not work." The issue "won't go away" if she's elected. "It will become more important."    Fox News' Chris Wallace caught a lot of pre-debate heat when he promised not to fact-check the candidates during Wednesday's face-off, so "he must feel vindicated" now that he's getting rave reviews, writes Paul Crookston at National Review. "He was at once the fairest moderator of the cycle and the one who drew the most substance out of the candidates," pressing them "on their positions not by contradicting their facts, as previous moderators had, but by asking questions with policy specifics" and posing "questions that were narrow rather than loaded." At a time "when trust in the news media has slipped down to 32 percent," says Crookston, "Wallace demonstrated how the industry can regain some lost respect."    Mayor de Blasio "wasted no time" before blaming the police sergeant involved in this week's fatal shooting of an emotionally disturbed woman, writes Seth Barron in City Journal. And "it may well be the case" that the cop "made serious errors." But the "real mistake," says Barron, "was the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's neglect of Deborah Danner's serious mental illness." After all, her case "was known to the city" and she "didn't take her anti-psychotic medicine." Kendra's Law has "proven effective at keeping the mentally ill out of hospitals and shelters and promoting compliance with doctor's orders," notes Barron. It's "a working solution to the problems of people like Deborah Danner, but the mayor refuses to use it."     The Philippines "is America's oldest ally in Asia, and until recently one of the closest," notes Max Boot in Foreign Policy. But its new "crude populist" president, Rodrigo Duterte, is transforming that relationship "in a fundamental and worrying manner." He "journeyed to Beijing this week to announce his 'separation from the United States' in military and economic terms," declaring that "a new alliance of the Philippines, China, and Russia would emerge." Why the flip-flop into Beijing's bed, given that "the Philippine people remain largely pro-American"? Says Boot: "It is a product of his peculiar psychology." Yet this spells potential disaster, since Washington may now "find itself hard-pressed to hold the 'first island chain' in the Western Pacific" whose defense "has been a linchpin of US strategy since the Cold War."    Israel's latest archeological discovery - the site where the Romans breached Jerusalem's walls during the great Jewish revolt in the year 70 - normally would only be of academic interest. But not now, writes Jonathan Tobin in Commentary. Because in light of UNESCO's recent vote to deny the Jewish history of the Temple Mount, it's "another reminder of the insidious nature of the war still being waged to extinguish the rebirth of Jewish sovereignty in the Jewish homeland." As Tobin notes, "all you have to do to prove the existence of historic Jewish ties to Jerusalem is to start digging virtually anywhere in the city or, for that matter, anywhere in the country." Which is why the Palestinians "are so quick to resist archeological work," especially in Jerusalem. 
November 5, 2016	 The New York Post	  If Donald Trump wins the White House on Tuesday, he'll be only the second United States president born in New York City.    So while you're waiting for a National Historic Landmarks plaque to go up on his childhood home at 85-15 Wareham Place in Jamaica Estates, Queens, go visit the birthplace of the one president born and bred in New York City - Theodore Roosevelt.    An imposing brownstone at 28 E. 20th St. marks the birthplace of our 26th president. Roosevelt, who was born on Oct. 27, 1858, lived here until 1872. The house is a near-replica of the original, which was torn down in 1916. When T.R. died in 1919, a group of rich society ladies raised money to rebuild the house, stocking it over the years with furniture and decorations donated by family members. The blue china in the living room was a gift of Eleanor Roosevelt, T.R.'s niece.     Theodore was a sickly child who spent most of his time with his nose in a book. His father famously said to him, "You have the mind, but you haven't got the body. To do all you can with your mind, you must make your body match it." So his father set up gymnasium equipment on the second-floor porch, and this is where 12-year-old Teddy began to bulk up. You can see the stepladder he used to crawl out the window to get to his gym.    The house, now a museum run by the National Park Service, recently underwent a $3.7 million renovation. It contains plenty of T.R. memorabilia, including the shirt he wore during an assassination attempt in Milwaukee in 1912. The bullet was slowed by a 50-page speech he had in his coat pocket. The speech, punctured by the bullet, is also on display.    In the dining room hangs an engraving of "Lady Washington's Reception" that depicts the Founding Fathers, including Alexander Hamilton (also founding father of the New York Post). These days, when tour guide Russel Fershleiser points him out, tourists ooh and ah. Such is the popularity of "Hamilton" that A.H. is upstaging T.R. in his own home.    Presidents have been darting in and out of NYC since the time of George Washington. As a general, he famously bid farewell to his officers at Fraunces Tavern on Pearl Street in 1783, telling them while fighting back tears, "With a heart full of love and gratitude, I now take leave of you."    Every president since Herbert Hoover has stayed at the Waldorf Astoria on Park Avenue (although since Chinese investors bought the hotel, President Obama has stayed elsewhere during NYC visits). The presidential suite is on the 35th floor and, it's said, is equipped with high-tech communication equipment and a bomb-proof floor. When the prez isn't in town, you can stay there. The suite is still available for election night at $2,500.    After he left the White House, Hoover moved into Suite 31A on the 31st floor of the Waldorf Towers. He died there Oct. 20, 1964. His Waldorf living room was re-created at his presidential library in Iowa.    John F. Kennedy thought the Waldorf was stuffy. He preferred the more stylish Carlyle Hotel at Madison and 76th Street, and stayed there so often that it was dubbed the New York White House. Legend has it that there was a secret passage through which Marilyn Monroe could slip in and out undetected. After Kennedy was assassinated, Jackie Kennedy lived in a suite there for 10 months. Caroline and John Jr. played in the lobby on rainy days.    Columbia University is closely associated with two presidents: Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama. As president of Columbia from 1948 until 1953, Eisenhower lived in a mansion at 60 Morningside Drive. Old faculty members heard rumors that Mamie Eisenhower enjoyed martinis at 11 a.m. in her bedroom on the top floor.    Obama's Columbia digs were more modest. As an undergrad in the early '80s, he lived in a third-floor walk-up at 142 W. 109th St. and, in his senior year, at 339 E. 94th St. A former roommate, Phil Boerner, recently recalled that they often ate breakfast at Tom's Restaurant on Broadway at 112th Street, which served as the gathering place for Jerry's gang on "Seinfeld."    Big Apple co-op boards are notoriously tough, especially if you're a disgraced ex-president. Richard Nixon moved to the city after a few years in exile in San Clemente, Calif. In 1979, he put down a deposit on a penthouse at 19 E. 72nd St., but the board vetoed the sale. Nixon wound up buying a 19th century townhouse at 142 E. 65th St. Arthur Schlesinger, a Kennedy aide who lived nearby, quipped, "There goes the neighborhood." But by all accounts, Nixon was friendly and approachable during daily walks.    Two presidents took the oath of office in the city: Washington, on the site where Federal Hall now stands, and Chester A. Arthur, in his townhouse at 123 Lexington Ave. Arthur was sworn in at 2:15 a.m. on Sept. 20, 1881, after President James Garfield was assassinated.    When he left the White House, Arthur returned to 123 Lex and died there in 1886. Since 1944, the building has been home to Kalustyan's, an Indian spice and grocery store.    Although many presidents lived in NYC, only one has his final resting place here. That would be the man who is buried in Grant's Tomb, at 122nd Street and Riverside Drive - Ulysses S. Grant, who is there with his wife, Julia. 
December 29, 2016	 The New York Post	  At the State Department Wednesday, John Kerry tried to emulate the late Fidel Castro with a tedious, whiny, self-absorbed and self-serving 72-minute marathon of musings about Israeli-Palestinian peace.    Contrary to the event's title and hype, Kerry's homily was light on "vision." That part of the speech was summarized, an hour into the thing, in a sketchy six-point plan only a political theoretician could like, which will soon join numerous other peace plans now collecting dust in forgotten archives.      Most of the speech was a defense of President Obama's decision to allow (Israel says orchestrate) a one-sided UN resolution last Friday. Why did America abstain? Israel settlement policies bury the two-state solution, boomed Kerry, and that "promises there will be greater violence and instability" in the Mideast.    After eight years of Obama, genocide and wholesale slaughter are already rampant in Syria, Yemen, Libya and the rest of the Mideast. ISIS controls land and exports terrorists to Europe and America. Russia and China instill fear in their neighbors. Kim Jong-un's nukes threaten US territory, and soon Iran will join him.    So Obama rushes to put out a fire in the only place that isn't burning at the end of his presidency     In his Wednesday sermon, Kerry conveniently forgot key events of the past eight years. So let's remind him.     Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, for one, refused to negotiate with Israel even after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu froze settlements for 10 months in 2010. In 2014, Kerry himself proposed to the two sides "parameters for peace" - likely the same six-point plan that he made public Wednesday. Netanyahu accepted it "with reservations." Abbas has yet to give an answer.    Elected for a four-year term, Abbas has been in power for nearly 12. Throughout, he has refused to negotiate with Israel's elected prime minister, because, he argues, Netanyahu is no man of peace - and just look at Israel's settlement policies.    So rather than shaping Palestine's future with Israel, Abbas has sought to take his beef to the world.    Which is why Kerry's endless protestation - the US abstention was no different than votes by "every past US administration" - is so off: Ronald Reagan, indeed, abstained on anti-settlement UN votes. But the US opposed an independent Palestinian state at the time. And Reagan opposed Israel's return to the "indefensible" armistice line that existed between 1949 and 1967.    Friday's US abstention was different because it enabled the Palestinian notion that the United Nations, speeches in Washington and international conferences - like the one scheduled to take place in Paris Jan. 15 - will deliver Israel's acquiescence and help bring Palestinian goals to fruition. Can international prosecutions and renewed boycott drives be far behind?    In his (thankfully short) response to Kerry Wednesday, Netanyahu expressed concern that a version of Kerry's "vision" would be adopted in Paris, and then, once again, quickly translated to a Security Council resolution.    And as Friday's vote shows, ganging up on Israel is the lowest common denominator for world diplomats. (Even America's closest allies at the Security Council, by contrast, rejected UN Ambassador Samantha Power's attempt that same day to impose an arms embargo on South Sudan.)    By elevating the Israeli-Palestinian dispute to the top of the global agenda as the world burns, Obama and Kerry gave themselves an easy way out. In the process, they made agreements between future Palestinian and Israeli leaders less likely, and harmed the ties that are being formed behind the scenes between Israel and Sunni Arab countries.    "Stay strong Israel, January 20 is fast approaching," President-elect Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday.

December 30, 2016	 The New York Post	  Hondo , doing his best to make HondoNation great again, vaulted into the Bettor's Guide penthouse with a so-so 8-8 record in Week 16 that nonetheless enabled him to snag a two-game lead on the sputtering Drew Loftis.    After engaging in some extreme vetting of this week's tussles, Mr. Aitch expects to retain his lofty status with the following:      Bills over Jets: With the toe tag having been put on Rex Ryan's coaching tenure in Buffalo, the "bet the new coach" theory applies with the Bills. New starting quarterback EJ Manuel may labor early, but he will find his groove against the Jets' laissez-faire "D."     From emailer BarkingMut, the HondoNation SoBe correspondent: DT Sheldon Richardson, with his Santa-like corpulence, tried to pick the Jets up after their humiliating Christmas Eve shellacking in New England by asking: "Where's the Ho Ho Ho's at?"    Michelle Obama, addressing Donald Trump's victory, told Oprah recently: "Now we are feeling what not having hope feels like." Now she knows what it's like to be a Jets fan.    Emailer Alan Weisberg, looking on the bright side of the Jets' dismal season, writes: At least they finally found somebody with stones.    Giants over Redskins: Hondo isn't buying the notion the Giants have no reason to go all out. By winning, they not only will go into the playoffs on a positive note, but also will eliminate the possibility of Odell Beckham Jr., their resident drama king, entering the concussion protocol because of another postgame head-banging session.    Dolphins over Patriots: The most interesting contest of the weekend might be the one between Mark Cannizzaro and Ms. Charleen as they try to avoid the shame of sweeping the basements in the overall and Best Bet standings. It's a tough race to handicap because both players are eminently capable of achieving the rare double-downer.    Titans over Texans: Houston lacks motivation, because it is locked in as the AFC's fourth seed. That means, even with Mariota out and the Titans reduced to Cassel-ing, the Texans will get rooked out of a 10th victory.     Browns over Steelers: Speaking of lacking motivation, Mike Tomlin intends to rest his killer Bs - Big Ben, Bell and Brown, which means it's the Steelers' scrubs against the Browns' starters, who are mostly scrubs.     Buccaneers over Panthers: Have to ride the Buccaneers, who have an outside shot at the playoffs, over the Panthers who have no shot. It's basic handicapping theory: Always take slim over none.     Cowboys over Eagles: Phil Jackson and Jeanie Buss have called off their engagement. It's unknown who called the play, but sources say the Lakers' co-owner no longer enjoyed his obsession with the triangle.     Vikings over Bears: There was a Michael Moore "Sighting" by Page Six this week at a restaurant in Hell's Kitchen. Speculation is he has begun preparing for the afterlife.    Ravens over Bengals: President Obama, doing some legacy building, recently proclaimed: "We made America more respected around the world." That's so true, if you exclude Russia, the Ukraine, China, Europe, and the Middle East.     Colts over Jaguars: The President finally took a hard line with the Russians on Thursday, giving the boot to 35 of their diplomats because of alleged hacking during the election. That will teach them to expose Hillary Clinton's lies.     Seahawks over 49ers: Obama claims he would have been reelected if he had run again, because Americans like his progressive agenda. Actually, they don't like it, and said as much on Nov. 8, when, presented with the proposition: "If you like my progressive agenda, you can keep my progressive agenda," they declined.    Falcons over Saints: Regarding the movie script about Monica Lewinsky's White House internship that is being shopped, the casting director will have to find an actor who can bend it like Bubba, not Beckham.    Chiefs over Chargers: There could be more security guards pleasuring themselves at this week's game at Qualcomm Stadium. That's because Chargers officials called a meeting and told all the guards that anyone thinking of engaging in such activity should beat it.     Cardinals over Rams: Topping the list of returned Christmas gifts this year are (according to Hondo's estimates): Chipotle gift certificates, e-cigs and the Samsung Galaxy Note 7s. Had some unlucky individual received all of those presents, they would have run the risk of blowing up while throwing up.    Broncos over Raiders: The Raiders have to be aching in their collective McGloins with Derek Carr up on the blocks for the foreseeable future. As Mr. Aitch sees it, the Silver and Black might want to stock up on some of Colorado's primo ganja to ease the pain of possibly plunging from the second seed and an opening-round bye to the fifth seed and a wild-card tussle in Houston. Just smoke, baby!    Packers over Lions: Ban Ki-moon, whose tenure as Secretary General of the UN comes to a close Saturday, has been tabbed to push the button to make the ball drop on New Year's Eve. That seems fitting, since he headed up an organization known for dropping the ball.    Speaking of New Year's Eve, rumor has it Hillary still is so distraught about losing the election she is refusing to take part in Saturday night's annual midnight dropping of her pantsuit in Chappaqua. 
January 3, 2017	 The New York Post	  In 2015, it was reported that China hacked the US Office of Personnel Management ("The Bum's Russian," Dec. 30).      It hacked into the personal records of millions of government employees, yet President Obama brought no action against this very serious issue.    Why now? Why this slap on the wrist against Russia? Could it be because Hillary Clinton shockingly lost an election that was a repudiation of his entire presidency? Al DiLascia    Let me get this straight: This country has a president who gives billions to a terror-sponsoring nation (Iran) and lets Syria kill thousands of innocent people but sanctions Russia for hacking Democrats' e-mails and exposing the truth?    Whenever Republicans do something stupid, Democrats have an amazing ability to prove they can be even dumber.      With the Republicans electing a big man-baby as president, Obama will not be outdone and acts even more like a baby than Trump by expelling Russia's diplomats.    If the Russians were truly hacking the election, Obama should have done something about it before Election Day, but he chose not to.     President Obama is such a strong and powerful leader, he finally sanctioned the Russians after years of hacking.     Why now? Because Obama is out of office in three weeks and won't have to face any retaliation. What a coward.     With only a few weeks left to his presidency, Obama finally grew a pair and issued sanctions against Russia for meddling in the election.     He was aware of the meddling for a while, but it took Hillary's loss to get the president to do something. It didn't matter if the hackers were stealing top secrets or military info.    Nothing better symbolizes the audacity of Obama, the Clintons and the Democratic Party than their willingness to incite a brand-new Cold War with Russia over Hillary's loss.    Obama's final shots against Russia confirm what doctors have often observed: that corpses are capable of flatulence even several days after death. Paul McGregor 
January 22, 2017	 The New York Post	  A Florida man whose house key is shaped like a gun was almost kept off a Carnival cruise because the company bans even replica weapons.    Henry Echevarria, who works in law enforcement, eventually agreed with cruise staffers to keep the key in a safe during the trip.     "It was comical because it's like, really, what am I going to do with that? You know they give you steak knives on the cruise," he told a TV news program.    Joseph Sandman, out on bond and facing serious sexual-assault charges, stopped to buy a six-pack in December because he was anxious about his case, according to his lawyer.    But the move was the 18th time Sandman allegedly violated the terms of his release, leading to his arrest.    A trucker found himself with a huge mess in suburban Indianapolis after the trailer on his big rig disconnected and overturned, spilling 38,000 pounds of the small spherical toys onto the side of the road.    Ron Herbst was a 19-year-old petty officer on the USS Coral Sea when he tossed the bottle with a message including his name and the date into the Atlantic.    A few months later, Gordon and Cindy Brevik found it while on a Florida vacation but simply put it away.     President Trump's official "Make America Great Again" caps are sold on his campaign Web site and sport a manufacturer label asserting "Made in the USA."    But knockoff versions hawked in DC Friday for the inauguration were reportedly made in China, Vietnam and ­Bangladesh. 
January 26, 2016	 The New York Post	  FORGET "wherefore art thou Romeo?" Here's where Len Cariou is. At off-B'way's Lion Theatre, premiering "Broadway and the Bard: An Evening of Shakespeare & Song."    Tony winner. Done musicals like "Sweeney Todd," "A Little Night Music," "Applause." What's he know from "thee" and "thou?"    "Please," he said, aggrieved. "In '59, I did 'Henry V.' In my native Canada's Stratford Theatre, in my 20s, I did Shakespearean roles. 'King Lear' I played twice when I was 35. You learn so much. From the gravitas, the language, you acquire a presence.     "Tough to ad-lib. You can't make up Shakespeare. The rhythm's 10 beats to a line. You just mumble something and get to your next words. It's scary. Especially when you listen to guys doing it a long time.    "You can't get a cough or cold. And there's no understudy. Just me onstage. You must protect yourself. Rest. Watch yourself carefully. Dress warmly." Drink? "Of course. Don't be silly."    About cellphone annoyances: "I've stepped out of character and said, 'Will wouldn't appreciate that.' A high school came to one performance, which became ridiculous. At the footlights I said, 'Shut up, or I'll have the police clear the building.' Act 2, the offender was gone, and so was the entire balcony."    Will and Len open the 28th and run through March 6. "That's the only time the theater was available, so six months ago I said, 'OK, let's do it.' "    A WORD for Charles Osgood, whom CBS-TV's bouncing and who told me: "My wife, five kids and I spend 10 weeks a year in our St-Tropez house. Otherwise, I'm up 3:30 a.m. Sundays." Osgood's reported news since Lincoln's bar mitzvah. I know time marches on, but so should his Peabody- and Emmy-winning "CBS News Sunday Morning."    SEVENTH Avenue mumbles. Nobody's dressing. It's sweaters and pants. Nobody's buying. It's Internet and online. With fashion gone the way of the bra, stores no longer keep merchandise. Good stuff's on consignment. To make room for the incoming season, unsold merchandise is marked down quickly, then shipped to discount houses. A VIP designer: "Can't make a living anymore. Nobody purchases retail."    SPIKE Lee, who's newie movie's "Chi-Raq": "Chicago's the homicide capital of the world" . . . GLORIA Vanderbilt, 91, getting HBO's documentary on her life and loves and loves and more loves. Years back, I remember Philippines' First Lady Imelda Marcos' East Side townhouse. She and Gloria playing with jewels and ropes of pearls stacked in an open trunk. I doubt that's in HBO's coming doc.    EVERYONE in trouble knocks the media. Always. It's their first zap. Mark Ruffalo in the film "Spotlight" says the media fights for the little guy. "Reporters are the last defense against tyranny." Thank you, Mark. Everyone else: Pay attention.    SELENA Gomez: "Victoria's Secret models make you want to work out and never eat anything" . . . JOHN Catsimatidis inviting 100 eaters for Chinese New Year buffet, 8 to 11 p.m. Our Place China Chalet, East 79th. If you're not invited, not my fault . . . MAR-a-Lago charity auction. Besides the Candidate and more security than Iowa has corn, one guest bought Mrs. Trump a bracelet, saying, "We know she liked it."    AN American five minutes, that creature looking to lead America by zapping its No. 1 city, New York, New York? Cruz rhymes with Shih Tzus. Stick a muzzle on him. 
January 22, 2017	 The New York Post	  Two images bookend the most remarkable political contest of modern times. In the first, Donald Trump rides an escalator down to the lobby of Trump Tower to announce his fanciful campaign for president. In the second, Election Night maps on television screens flash red as 30 states fall like dominoes into Trump's column.    Just 17 months elapsed between those unforgettable moments, yet that span stands as an epoch unto itself in the history of America. We were eyewitnesses to a revolution, a rising up of people who felt shunned, betrayed and left behind. They called themselves "deplorables and irredeemables," turning Hillary Clinton's slurs into a rallying cry as they threw off the yoke of the old political order and trusted the nation to a true outsider.    Donald John Trump is the most unlikely revolutionary ever to stalk western civilization. He built buildings and a personal fortune, then nearly lost it all before rising again by making his name synonymous with wealth and success.    His life was his brand and it was more grandiloquent than any opera. He was a playboy, a serial seducer and the incarnation of a new and sometimes vulgar Gilded Age.    His marriages, divorces and high jinks were catnip for newshounds. He was tailor-made for TV and became a household name with his signature line, "You're fired!"    He was a rich celebrity who had it all, but it wasn't enough. He had the chutzpah to dream he could spin his star power into political gold.    For his daring, he was mocked and made the butt of endless jokes, especially about his hair. Perhaps their laughter blinded the savants, for they missed the birth of a phenomenon. A clue that foreshadowed the ultimate outcome was hiding in plain sight, yet precious few saw it.    From the moment Trump stepped off that escalator in June of 2015 to join the race, producers at television news programs realized that the more they turned their cameras on him, the more viewers they got.    So that's what they did, and in a flash, Trump's rallies were bursting at the seams as thousands showed up when other candidates were lucky to draw hundreds.    His slogan, Make America Great Again, was so in-your-face that there was no mistaking its meaning.    The scoffers, including nearly every major news organization and all the pooh-bahs of Washington, consoled themselves by thinking it was a bread-and-circus act, that people were turning out just to gawk at a rich buffoon.    They reassured each other that when the voting started, the unwashed rabble would come to their senses and Trump would crash and burn like a cheap hot-air balloon. Then they, the all-knowing elite, would go about their business of anointing a respectable Republican who would dutifully lose the general election to Clinton. That's the way the world worked. *    That mistake would be forgivable if it were a one-off. But it was just the start of the establishment's failure to understand what was happening in the huge swath of America that stretched beyond the Beltway and between the urbanized coasts.    To this day, most of the professional scoffers still write off Trump's stunning upset as the revenge of an angry white working class stewing in hate. Journalists who bother to sojourn to red-state hinterlands approach his supporters as if they are visiting the zoo.   Trump knew his audience from the start. Just as his genius for selling his brand made him rich, his genius for reading the electorate made him president. There was a desperate hunger among millions upon millions of Americans for a bold leader and he aimed to feed it.    He was all brass bands and bare knuckles and exactly what Republicans and many independents wanted. He didn't take crap from anyone and said what those voters were thinking about jobs, trade, immigration and so much more.    His slogan, Make America Great Again, was so in-your-face that there was no mistaking its meaning. It was nationalist and populist, and the fact that those ideas offended the tender sensibilities of the political and media elite was a bonus. Trump's no-bulls-t approach struck a deep chord in the hearts of Americans who felt abandoned by both political parties and their government.    Their patience and their bank accounts were exhausted. From the horrors of 9/11 to the quagmire in Iraq to the economic collapse in 2008, George W. Bush's presidency was a demoralizing slog. Then came eight years of Barack Obama's lectures, apology tours and liberal overreach. As ObamaCare and other stifling impositions slammed the door on the American Dream, many citizens were equally furious at Republicans in Congress for failing to fight back.    None of them was fooled by happy-talk statistics about jobs when the economy they lived in still dragged along the bottom. Throw in the nightmares spawned by the medieval butchery of the Islamic State, including a spate of homeland slaughters, and a huge slice of the electorate was primed to put someone very, very different in the Oval Office. *    Alas, smooth sailing is not in Trump's DNA. He had - and has - a knack for going too far, and his embrace of the claim that Obama was born in Africa, and thus ineligible to be president, threatened to derail him until he formally backed down. That misbegotten venture remains an open wound to many African-Americans who see it as a racial attack on the first black president.    But it is also true that Trump is "an equal-opportunity offender," as his daughter Ivanka once said. In that and other ways, he evokes memories of another pot-stirring New Yorker, the late, great Ed Koch. In fact, Koch might have been thinking of Trump as well as himself when he wrote, "I'm not the type to get ulcers, I give them."   Trump's gift for the zinger insult - "Little Marco" and "Lyin' Ted" - found its ripest target in Jeb Bush. "Low energy" fit like a glove, and the former front-runner wilted.    Yet Trump looked like he had another gift, too: an ability to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Again and again, he would build momentum, only to throw a banana peel in his way, or have one surface from the past. The tape where he boasted that he would walk up to women and "grab them by the pu-y" nearly sank him because there was no denying his own words.    That was the low point of a pattern that would play out right up to Election Day. Indeed, it hasn't fully stopped yet.    The transition, for all his great success in jawboning Carrier Corp. and carmakers to build their products in the USA instead of Mexico, is also being defined by angry Tweet storms as Trump punches down the likes of actress Meryl Streep. To the extent that they mean anything, polls show him losing ground during a period when presidents-elect mostly expand their popularity.    But his critics, especially those whose heads are exploding over his election, should also remember this: His upside is enormous. His fierce determination to succeed now stands to benefit the nation.   Trump, though he certainly can be headstrong, is also willing to change course when he has to. And don't forget his incredible stamina, which helped him beat Hillary Clinton by outworking her down the stretch.    Most important, the areas of his signature focus - unchecked illegal immigration, a decline of good-paying manufacturing jobs and a depleted military - are fundamental to a national revival. They are daily obstacles to our fellow Americans, and our security and must be fixed if our democracy is to endure and prosper.   Trump was tested by the fire of a brutal campaign and was on the receiving end of an unprecedented barrage. It was one thing for the slings and arrows to come from his opponent and the White House, quite another for the media to conspire against him. The powerful confederacy against him made his triumph all the more amazing.    Still, it is worth repeating that while he is president No. 45, he is the first to have had neither government nor military experience. That seems risky and it is a virtual certainty that he will be tested early and often, both at home and abroad.    Already, the boycott of his inauguration by sour-grapes Democrats breaks new ground in disrespect and dangerously sows seeds of disunion. Who knows what challenges China, Iran, Russia and the Islamic State will present.    Besides, it's not as if Barack Obama leaves Washington and the world in splendid shape, so there's no shortage of existing difficulties. History, if it's honest, cannot treat Obama kindly.    Now it's time to look forward. Donald Trump is the new sheriff in town and, like Sinatra, he did it his way. Say a prayer for him and the exceptional nation he leads. 
February 23, 2016	 The New York Post	  I know what you're thinking: Isn't this supposed to be the city of big hats, rodeos, the solar system's sexiest pom-pommers and JFK's final carpool?    Yes, now and forever, but Big D is likewise home to other varmints you might not be expecting: art geeks.     Ah, but being an art fiend around town is more lucrative than it may seem, from the art walks along the mean streets of its Deep Ellum 'hood, to curating the gallotel  er, hotellery  or whatever it is you'd like to call the hybrid museum/inn that is the iconic Hilton Anatole.    And this being Texas, the rivalry between artscapes is no less intense than that of, say, nearby TCU and Baylor's.    Murals of Krang from "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." Number 5 of "Short Circuit" fame. The Icee polar bear. If you didn't know any better, the graffiti artists around east Dallas' Deep Ellum neighborhood were totally NWA - nerds with artistry. Hell, they wear that title proudly, according to local celebrity tagger, Pabst Artcan Tall Boy 2015 winner and body artist Jerod "DTOX" Davis, who leads tours ($40/pp) of the former warehouse district that's couched between I-45 and Exposition Avenue. Nearly every wall of every building here doubles as a giant graffiti canvas. Even Mark Cuban, notoriously protective of his Mavericks brand, signed off on a mural of a celebratory Dirk Nowitzki after the Mavs beat the Heat in the 2011 NBA finals.    Historically serving as an enclave for Dallas' black and European immigrant communities, Deep Ellum was a hot bed of jazz and blues clubs and domino parlors going back to the early 1900s (the current name of the hood itself is local slang for the original moniker, "Deep Elm") - Texas' kinda-sorta version of New Orleans, hold the Gallic flair. It was also where Henry Ford set up a Model T assembly plant in 1914. The area started to fall into disrepair after World War II, and it was nearly destroyed by crime by the end of the century.    But the city began revitalizing Deep Ellum in the 2000s; today you'll find all sorts of new clubs, jewelry stores, galleries, restaurants - all of which smartly commission local street artists to tag their walls (it's going to happen anyway). The aforementioned Krang, e.g. - a mutant, supervillain brain who pilots an android body from its stomach, on the off chance you didn't know - enjoys a wing and a beer on siding at Deep Ellum's BrainDead Brewing.    BTW: If you stumble on any Montana Cans-wielding writers working on a piece-in-progress, they're more than happy to chat you up.    Talk about a night at the museum. You'll come to this Downtown landmark for the stylish suites, V Spa and S R steakhouse atop the roof   but you'll stay for the exhibits.    Long before the burgeoning Design District that surrounds it got into the gallery game, the 1,606-room hotel's father and East Asian art-o-holic, developer Trammell Crow was busy culling his own collection. Today it has more than 1,000 pieces, making it one of the largest art-n-antique collections ever amassed by an American hotel.    They're not hard to miss, from the 12-foot panels of the Berlin Wall painted by Jurgen Grosse, to a room filled with gobs and gobs of English Wedgewood Porcelain from the 1850s, to the hand-painted gold-and-enamel plates dating back to 17th-century China.    Eccentric sculptures permeate the 45-acre grounds: lazing Buddhas, boxing rabbits, a "Riding into the Sunset" Will Rogers on horseback. Life-sized-ish, Thai-crafted elephants that were placed in the lobby to greet partygoers of the 1984 Republican National Convention remain today (I smell a "Trunks for Trump" promotion just waiting to happen).    Take a guided art tour of it all, or DIY with the help of a the hotel's free Anatole Art app for iPhone or Android.    Oh, and the Anatole's unveiling a whole new pool/swim-up bar/lazy river/luxe cabana'd complex called Jade Waters this summer, so even if you hate art, there's that (rooms from $209).    Not sure if you've noticed, but Texans are concerned with size. Quite concerned. Fittingly, Dallas has the largest arts district in the entire country. Spanning some 68 acres and 19 connected blocks, the three-decade-old DAD is a village of museums, performance spaces, restaurants, churches, a school, offices and coveted residences.    The headliner is the 370,000-square-foot Dallas Museum of Art, which sports 23,000 works from over 5,000 years of human imagining and tinkering. Temporary exhibits to look out for: "Jackson Pollock: Blind Spots," currently on display until March 20; and in April, "Saints and Monsters: Prints by Albrecht Dürer," devoted to the terrifyingly cool, supernatural works of the German Renaissance printmaker. But the best time to visit is when the sun goes down on the third Friday of each month when the DMA hosts "Late Nights," featuring concerts, film screenings and readings till midnight (general admission is free; special exhibit tix are $16).    Or, right across the way, make like the city's many yoga rats, food truck fanatics, ping-pong paddlers, outdoor movie screeners and concert goers and mosey on over to Klyde Warren Park. Serving as the district's central gathering space - nay, the entire city's, as it connects the DAD to both Uptown and Downtown - the 5.2-acre decked park hosted the inaugural Park & Palate food-and-wine fundraiser (tastings, cooking demos, live music, chef judging, booze, etc.) last September. 
March 8, 2016	 The New York Post	  Last week Nancy Reagan's close friend told me: "She's seeing nobody. I can no longer visit. Too frail. Can't even telephone. Our last conversation the voice was so weak I barely heard her."    Ronald Reagan and my husband headed sister theatrical unions concurrently. Reagan, president of SAG, the Hollywood movie colony's Screen Actors Guild. Joey, president of AGVA, New York's American Guild of Variety Artists, which monitored Sinatra to Elvis to circus pros, every performer who worked live.     They were friends. I have photos from when Joey escorted brand-new President Reagan to the New York Post newsroom to walk around, meet its staff.     Nancy became a dominant personality - before haute couture, red dresses, astrology, children's quarrels, buying White House china, asking California's previous governor to quit the mansion quickly so she could move in. I remembered her first day as first lady.    We were in Poland. Joey had Reagan's California home number and tried placing a congratulatory call. No operator. I jiggled the phone. Waited. No operator. We went downstairs to complain. Hotel manager: "Sorry. She's not working now. It's food time."    "But we're calling the president of the United States!" Manager: "Yes. But sorry. It is her food time."    After chewing her Polish ham sandwich, the Communist operator placed our call. Nancy answered. The first words we heard from the first day of the first lady was her first shout: "Honey, it's for you."     FORMER Sen. George Mitchell, 2016 St. Patrick's Day Parade grand marshal, to Ray Kelly, grand marshal of 2010's St. Pat's Parade, "Tips?" Kelly: "Comfortable shoes" . . . LE Cirque table talk: Come summer Christie's will prep Joan Rivers' Connecticut estate auction . . . GOV. George Pataki: "The presidential election's still early. Maybe someone emerges. Maybe somewhere we get another Abraham Lincoln."     CATE Blanchett to an interviewer: "I'm tired of talking about Cate Blanchett. Can't we talk about something else?" . . . STUFFING yourself at great Italian places like Campagnola you hear things. Come August Bill Clinton hits 70. Win or lose, never mind election, a big party's being planned . . . BERNIE Socialist. (Note the B.S. initials. Same odor as Pres. B.O.) I just felt like mentioning that . . . CBS-TV's Rolls-Royce of news magazines, "60 Minutes," rolls right along. After Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, son of Pierre Trudeau, the country's most colorful PM since the Ice Age, exec producer Jeff Fager's scheduled the president of Argentina. Lesley Stahl's sit-down is March 20 . . . Amy Schumer's GQ fantasy: "In a hibachi restaurant Tracy Morgan makes me laugh until I can't breathe."     WALKING dog-centric New York I'd meet 15 or 20 sporting furs, cashmeres, booties. Ralph Lauren's shop gave my Yorkies three sweater fittings. Maybe since we live longer, or lonelier minus loved ones, or impersonally because work is via cells, computers, pets became part of us. Family. They're little people.    Last Tuesday when I lost Jazzy, Ivana sent her dog Tiger Trump's picture. E-mails, phone calls, letters, more flowers than at Gotti's funeral from dog owners Carolina Herrera, Randy Levine, Melissa Rivers, Buffy Cafritz, Caroline Hirsch, Joanna Mastroianni, Judy Wilpon, Dr. Rock Positano. I can't remember names right now. My eyes fill with tears. 
March 14, 2016	 The New York Post	  Spring arrives in a week, bringing daffodils, hay fever and an urge to clean the house - not to mention the snowstorm that late March usually sneaks in. Read on for the best in vernal equalizers.    Woman's Day touts "clever uses for baby powder" - probably not the best idea considering Johnson & Johnson has to pay $72 million for an ovarian cancer death linked to talcum powder. The magazine, apparently unfazed by this development, suggests using it between the bed sheets to absorb moisture and for silencing creaky floor boards. Just don't shake it on your body   The April issue of this Hearst magazine is an unremarkable mix of organizing tips, household budgeting, minimizing pet fur, etc. Stuff we've read a million times. The spring-theme fashion section was surprisingly modern and fresh. The rest is forgettable. Spring forward.     New editor Elizabeth Graves is starting to put her own imprint on Martha Stewart Living, the domestic diva's namesake magazine, now under the Meredith umbrella. Under Eric Pike, who exited the top of the masthead last year, the title had become a little too high concept, even for city slickers who love home arts and crafts. Graves is getting back to basics. There's a feature on tidying up the pantry, recipes for brisket and pound cake and new uses for yogurt. For collectors, the mag suggests a nice display of vintage dustpans and brushes. Trust Martha to turn trash pans into a lusted-after object with an artful photograph on the inside back page. The mag's still glamorous founder never fails to raise a giggle with some advice on how to get her hair-do. That's coupled, of course, with some shots of her modeling years. Martha, as always, is the "mane" event.    Family Circle delivers a meat-and-potatoes issue, offering little of the aspirational ideas we crave from a magazine. But it knows its readers, who will lap up home tips from HGTV's Chip and Joanna Gaines and a profile of Hallmark Channel regular Lori Loughlin. As its name suggests, the long-running magazine is focused on family issues, such as a twin coping with her brother's autism and a tennis-crazed family. The spring-theme reading is limited to a giant product spread on the 50 best cleaning products, a neutral fashion palette and, of course, Easter egg decorating.    When we think of spring, the fireplace doesn't immediately jump to mind. Regardless, Good Housekeeping offers ways to spring-ify the hearth: Start with some plants and some art. Elsewhere, the mag offers up no less than seven pages of bunny and egg-motif decorating ideas . We'd rather indulge in egg coloring than try out the 25 spring-cleaning hacks (or tips as they used to be called). Iron the carpet is one such nugget - we kid you not. There's plenty to read in the issue, ranging from the couple that took up goat farming to teen suicide prevention, but we take serious issue with the mag's suggestion that getting through a sink full of dishes can boost happiness and reduce stress.    Aside from its story on El Chapo, in which Mexican actress Kate del Castillo accuses Sean Penn of hiding his journalistic intentions as they were planning their visit to the drug lord (Penn's assertions to the contrary are "total and complete bulls--t," she says), the New Yorker finally does a piece about "deep tensions" inside the Democratic Party. Ryan Lizza, who has written something like half a dozen stories on such tensions in the GOP, gets Bernie Sanders on the record while Hillary Clinton abstains. "It doesn't matter what her policies are," says Sanders, who doubts whether Clinton will "stand up and fight" for the jobless given her warm ties with Goldman Sachs. Elsewhere, check out Amy Davidson's piece on the 1924 Democratic National Convention, in which the party narrowly escaped giving an institutional seat to the Ku Klux Klan.    Time's gauzy goodbye to Nancy Reagan hit the stands right before last Friday's dust-up over her AIDS legacy, courtesy of Hillary Clinton. Indeed, through the lens of the Clinton years, it's almost surreal to recall what a pair of billing-and-cooing lovebirds Ronnie and Nancy were. That's despite Nancy's "dragon lady" persona pushed by the press, from the $200,000 she spent on china upon her White House arrival, to her supposed pivotal role in ending the Cold War as she left. Patti Davis reveals her mother constantly blasted the TV as a widow to cope with loneliness. "I had to practically yell to be heard," Davis writes. Back in the present, Joe Klein says the media has realized "too late" that John Kasich was worth more of its attention than Donald Trump: "What a fresh voice we have squandered."  
May 22, 2016	 The New York Post	  She had listed a water heater that we were selling on letgo.com. The buyer said he would be sending a check for more than the amount of the listed price of $350, and asked her to distribute various amounts to others.     I thought this to be suspicious and did some research, and came up with similar information as you recently did when you played along in an internet fraud attempt.      I received the check at my work address, as I did not want to provide the buyer with our home address.     I have attached the check and the notes my daughter received. It's sad to think there are people out there who actually are scammed by these disgusting creatures.     Hopefully, more people will be made aware by your recent article, and the people running these scams will be stopped and punished! R.O.    First, nobody sends you more money than you deserve - except your mom and dad (and in some families, even they can't be trusted).    So if someone comes up with a convoluted method of paying you for a good or service, there is something amiss, and don't get involved.     Second, don't ever let anyone near your house if you are selling something. And certainly don't let anyone in your house!    And if you do sell something, don't take personal checks. They may as well be written on Charmin. Demand cash - and even then you can't be sure it's not counterfeit. Thanks for sharing this.     My daughter got involved in a similar scheme, and we actually took the material we received to the local police station.    We asked if they wanted the "evidence," but they were not interested. So no wonder these guys continue to scam people.    Dear E.S.: In fairness to the cops, what can they do? These guys might be somewhere in Africa, and local police just don't have that kind of reach or resources.     Educating the public to these scams is really the only defense. And that's what my column intends to do - although I have to take credit for doing it in an entertaining sort of way.     So don't cash the check. And unless you are trying to have some fun at the scammers' expense, don't contact them.    Dear John: I enjoy your columns. But it looks like the oil traders are spoiling your prediction that gas prices would stay low.    Obviously, Brent crude has really jumped up. Who is doing it? I have read of no shortages on the world market. B.S.    Dear B.S.: Yes, gasoline prices are up, and I take it personally that speculators are trying to make me look bad.    But this is the start of the famous peak driving season, a built-in seasonal excuse to drive energy prices higher despite the supply-and-demand factors in the marketplace.     Yes, there is still too much oil and gasoline out there. And, yes, the US economy barely expanded in the first quarter, and hardly grew in the fourth quarter of 2015. So there is no reason that traders should be predicting an increase in demand. China's economic growth is slowing. Japan is in the pits. Europe is a mess, and technology is making cars more fuel efficient.     So all speculators have to count on is the peak driving season. When we learn that driving isn't peaking, prices go lower.    But the bigger problem is that Washington is not reining in speculation in essential commodities like oil. And nobody in the media - except me - points out that these jumps in oil prices are the result of Wall Street greed. If Wall Street speculators were forced to take physical delivery of the oil represented by the contracts they buy, we'd either have lower prices or a lot of barrels stacked in backyards in Greenwich, Conn.     So my next prediction is for oil to go back down sharply and quickly this summer. And it will become an issue in the presidential campaign after Donald Trump gets nominated. In fact, that's an issue that could get him elected. 
September 20, 2016	 The New York Post	  Jessie Graff is one tough "American Ninja Warrior." The 32-year-old stunt performer ("Supergirl," "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.") made history in August by becoming the first woman to complete Stage 1 of the NBC show's National Finals course. Here, she tells The Post's ANDREA MORABITO about the daily diet and fitness routine that made her "Ninja" ready.     I never think about [exercise] as keeping in shape, I think about it as what skills do I need to be able to do and what muscles do I need to build to be strong enough to do those skills? What kind of abuse am I going to be dealing with at work, and how do I build an armor for myself to prevent injury?    I have a lifting routine - push day (bench presses, lateral raises), pull day (pullups, curls) and leg day (plyometrics, squats) - which I do six or seven days a week on a three-day cycle. In addition, I'll do an hour or two of martial arts stuff - jump kicks, spin kicks, sweeps and feet stances - if it's leg day. On pullup day, I'll go rock-climbing for two or three hours or go swimming. On push day, I'll do press handstands and boxing. There's lots of stunt-specific training and skill training that has to be mixed in as much as possible on the appropriate day, but everyone's schedule in stunts is chaotic.    I eat a balanced meal every three to five hours. I have coffee in the morning, but instead of creamer I use either a chocolate or vanilla protein shake - it's still sweet but it has natural sugars and many other redeeming qualities. I usually have a protein bar with that, too. Every meal I make sure to have one to two servings of protein, and pack in as many vegetables as I can - lots of dark greens - and one to two servings of whole-grain carbs like brown rice or quinoa and sometimes fruit.    I'm super lazy when it comes to cooking; if it takes more than 15 minutes, I am out. I'll throw a frozen fish patty in a pan with avocado oil, and it cooks while I make a giant salad with blueberries, cranberries, plain Greek yogurt, chia seeds and walnuts.    I also make big vegetable mixtures; I always have broccoli, frozen peas and frozen white corn. I keep protein bars in my car with packs of roasted seaweed [for] when I'm dashing from one thing to the next.    I definitely plan on doing ["American Ninja Warrior"] again; I will train with that intent. I'm trying to use the publicity I have right now to get more acting roles so that I can play my own superheroes. If I happen to get an action movie . . . and I'm in China while they're shooting, that would trump competing on "Ninja Warrior" next year. 
October 30, 2016	 The New York Post	  Be the first off the ball with a jet-like first step. Be first to strike in engaging the offensive tackle. And, most importantly, be the first to the quarterback, the first to swipe down on arm and separate ball from hand.    So much of Umenyiora's NFL career was based on speed. How ironic that his life out of shoulder pads and cleats is all about patience and waiting.    "I had no idea the amount of work, to see all the stuff you have to do in order to get something like that to happen,'' Umenyiora recently told The Post. "If I was to see that happen that would be tremendous. It would be crazy.''     Tremendous and crazy are merely two of the sentiments attached to Umenyiora's assigned project: Settle an NFL team in the United Kingdom. Not for a one-game visit, akin to the road trip the Giants successfully completed in their Week 7 victory over the Rams, but an NFL team permanently based out of London. This is something the league wants and the league usually gets what it wants. And Osi Umenyiora, former Giants pass rushing defensive end, has been tasked to help make it happen.    "It's a perfect role for him,'' said Jerry Reese, the Giants general manager, who took Umenyiora in the second round of the 2003 NFL Draft and admits he is one of his favorite picks and players. "He's got his boots on the ground. If anybody can get it going it'll be Osi.''    It is not an official title, but Umenyiora is working for the NFL as a special ambassador in the United Kingdom. He spent 12 years as a player, amassing 75 sacks (and two Super Bowl rings) in his 10 years with the Giants - he is in the team's Ring of Honor - and 10 more sacks in his last two years with the Falcons. Umenyiora lives seven or eight months in London and the other months in Atlanta.    "They're trying to get it to a point where I'm here in London full time,'' he said. "We'll see how that goes.''    This is a labor of love. Umenyiora was born in London and spent the first seven years of his life there before his family moved to Nigeria and later to Alabama, where he went to high school and began his ascent in football. He now lives in the Notting Hill section of London with his 9-year-old son, T.J., and wife, Leila Lopes - the former 2011 Miss Universe representing Angola. Umenyiora resides about 20 minutes from his childhood home in the Golders Green section.    "It's a wonderful city, outside of the weather,'' he said. "It's truly incredible, the people are so together, it's cool. No violence, or very little violence, people aren't running around here with guns, you just feel safe walking around. It's a real cool city. No Trump over here.''    The Giants and the NFL brought Umenyiora back to London in 2007, for the first time since he was 7, for the first-ever International Series game, won by the Giants 13-10 in the rain at Wembley Stadium. "I remember the game was horrible, it was terrible,'' he said. "But the experience was great.''    The experience stayed with Umenyiora and forged his belief the NFL overseas could work. The NFL reached out to him after his retirement following the 2014 season and a unique role was born.    Umenyiora works for the BBC as part of NFL-themed TV shows on Tuesdays (review of what took place the previous weekend) and Saturdays (a look at the upcoming games). For the Giants-Rams game, Umenyiora was up in the booth at Twickenham Stadium, providing analysis during the time outs and breaks - the BBC does not go to commercials during games. By all accounts, he is a natural, keeping his comment loose and lively.    "I think he's a great guy,'' said Neil Reynolds, a British NFL studio host on Sky Sports, a competitor of the BBC and of Umenyiora. "I interviewed Osi when I was working on Sky Sports, loved watching him as a player and I think he's got a real future as a broadcaster. People always reach out to me on Sky and say 'Oh, we watch on BBC, we're not watching on Sky' and I say 'Absolutely fine, Osi's got you taken care of because he does a great job.' ''    Reynolds and Umenyiora collaborate for NFL event promotional work; in the summer they teamed for a six-night NFL cavalcade starting in Scotland and ending in the south coast of England. It is all about growing the NFL in the soccer-mad, rugby-loving, cricket-watching U.K.    Can it happen? There are three games in London this season - the Redskins and Bengals finish up this year's series on Sunday - and possibly a fourth added next year. Mark Waller, the NFL's executive vice president of international, said there will be 40,000 fans attending all three of this year's NFL games. That is a reasonable season-ticket holder base, in the minds of the NFL. In addition to Wembley and Twickenham, a brand-new state of the art soccer stadium in Tottenham will be completed in 2018 and the NFL is already booked to play there. It will be in the 60,000-seat capacity range - ideal for what the league is looking for overseas - and will be NFL-ready, with all the necessary bells and whistles, including a retractable football field that can slide in and replace the soccer pitch. If the NFL lands permanently in England, it will be in Tottenham.    "He's fantastic,'' said Waller, who grew up in Africa, went to boarding school in Wales and works for the NFL out of New York. "It's such a great thrill for us to have him. He's doing fantastic. He's doing fantastically on the BBC. He's become quite a figure and that was always the goal when he came over, we wanted him to have the chance to be the face of the sport with our broadcast partners. The last time I saw him he was very happy.''    He is happy, and also a realist. Cracking a robust sports market is tough. The day after the Giants-Rams game, The Sun newspaper in London splashed Chelsea's 4-0 beatdown of Manchester United on the back page. What followed were six full pages of Premier League coverage and then pages of Grand Prix racing and graded horse race entries. Buried 11 pages into the sports section - the very last page - was a small picture and six-paragraph story that called the Giants' 17-10 victory at the famous rugby facility "a snoozefest'' that "was not a game to convert fans of the oval ball to gridiron.'    "I feel like they're so traditional in what they like over here,'' Umenyiora said. "The kids like it, actually the kids love it, but it's the older generation fighting to hold onto their values and their traditions. So it's a constant battle trying to promote the game and trying to put it out front and center. It would be similar to another game coming into America and trying to take on American football.    "We're trying to position the NFL as the new cool young sport. The younger generation really likes it. But it's been a battle, no doubt about it.''    If anyone can win the battle, those who have seen him in action believe Umenyiora is the man to lead the charge.    "Having someone like Osi here, he's got that British background, won two Super Bowls, likes to talk about how he beat up Tom Brady, it's all great for the fans   they actually can see it, touch it and feel it,'' Reynolds said.    "This is his neighborhood, he knows about it, and he's just such a good and such a charismatic person and caring person, it's a great role for him,'' Reese said. "I can see him being the president one day, what do you call him [in England]? The prime minister, I could see him in that kind of role, an official office.''    Umenyiora laughed at that suggestion - "Jerry's so funny, man'' - and realizes some players - perhaps a majority - would be skeptical of living in London and playing for a team based on foreign soil. He said he would advise players, "It's not going to be a huge amount of time in your life so take advantage of it, experience something different, make money for you and your family, let your family experience something different and don't be so closed-minded and be all 'No, no, no, I got to stay here.' It's a great place, man. Experience life. It's not like you're playing in the middle of China. You're in London.''    In his head, Umenyiora knows "the NFL has put so much money into it, they've invested so heavily into London.'' In his heart, he believes "if we continue with the path we've been on for the last couple of years I think there eventually will be a franchise here.''    If that day ever comes, he joked (or maybe not) he wants to be the general manager of the London team - or perhaps attain an even a loftier goal. Osi Umenyiora, NFL commissioner in the U.K.? 
January 4, 2017	 The New York Post	  Consolidation in the media and entertainment industries will pick up in 2017, sparked by shifting consumer habits and expected relaxed antitrust enforcement by a Trump White House, a report from a media analyst on Tuesday predicted.     Epix, MGM, Pandora, Spotify, T-Mobile and WWE are each fingered by BTIG's Richard Greenfield as takeover targets.    Comcast, to keep pace with AT&T, which in 2015 gobbled up DirecTV and is in the process of buying Time Warner, will be on the acquisition hunt, Greenfield predicted. Possible targets include Epix and T-Mobile.    After noting Comcast has no platform for SVOD (Subscription Video on Demand), the analyst said an Epix acquisition would allow the media conglomerate to license its Universal movies to the premium channel and offer Epix to its subscribers.    Comcast's interest in T-Mobile could be as a spoiler - to thwart a tie-up with Sprint - or strategic, Greenfield said. T-Mobile's national wireless platform would strengthen Comcast's ability to go head-to-head against AT&T.     BTIG also expects MGM to be swallowed by AT&T to give it the Bond franchise and "a robust unscripted TV production unit."    And although Pandora has maintained that it wants to remain independent, competition will drive the music streamer into the arms of a suitor, perhaps Sirius, the analyst predicted.    Spotify could also fall - if only because no big media player can resist delivering "other product offerings such as video content" to Spotify's 40 million subscribers, BTIG said.     Expectations that WWE will crack the China market this year made it a takeover target, BTIG predicts.    None of the companies has made overtures to buy or be bought, and the opinions belong only to BTIG. 
January 22, 2017	 The New York Post	  For those not attending the inauguration, Activate consultant Michael J. Wolf threw a final-night dinner in Davos, Switzerland, for 80 at the famed Post Hotel.     After a week of panels about how wealth is distributed around the globe, guests were lured with the promise that there wouldn't be any speeches.     Matt Damon and Willi.i.am, were slated to eat traditional Swiss food alongside global circuit-goers Eric Schmidt, Martin Sorrell and Arianna Huffington.      Yahoo's Marissa Mayer and satellite TV entrepreneur Charlie Ergen were invited, along with journalists WSJ Editor-In-Chief Gerard Baker, Yahoo Finance boss Andy Serwer and Fortune's Alan Murray.     Our tipsters say Topic A at Davos this year was China's stunning new role as a global champion of free trade, and the business community's renewed sense of optimism.     "There was talk about AT&T and Time Warner, Facebook's role in the election, European Union regulations on technology companies and who President Trump will pick to run the FTC," said our insider in the Swiss mountains.      According to SEC documents filed last week, MSG will loan its executive chairman its Gulfstream G550. In return, Dolan will lease his older G450 back to the company. Dolan does, after all, hopscotch the country, playing gigs with his band.     An MSG spokesman explained: "There are two jets, and when Jim's plane is taking the Knicks boss Phil Jackson somewhere and he needs it, then there are two. It makes sense."     Deal-watchers could find out this week. Verizon has been hemming and hawing about whether it will follow through on its $4.83 billion deal to acquire the portal after Yahoo got hit with news of two hacks.     The two companies' earnings calendars might provide a clue. Yahoo reports its fourth-quarter report on Jan. 23, after the bell. Then Verizon reports its latest numbers on the morning of Jan. 24.     Last year, Yahoo's earnings were released Feb. 2, and Verizon's were out on Jan. 21. Our Street sources believe the dates portend something good, and suggest the two parties have been spending a lot of time negotiating the extent to which Yahoo retains legal liabilities.     She just doesn't usually employ them. It's been a year since Alison Brod Marketing & Communications, a boutique firm in Murray Hill, had a man on staff.    "Any man can apply," Brod told our Lisa Fickenscher. "But most of the résumés we get are from women."    That might have something to do with the clients she attracts and the employee perks she provides at her firm.     Among her clients are nail polish company OPI, Drew Barrymore's Flower Beauty makeup line and Ralph Lauren Fragrances.    "Some people view [us] as a giant sorority," Brod told On the Money, adding that the company has taken on some male-oriented clients recently, like Dollar Shave Club, Burger King and JackThreads.    OPI sends a manicurist twice a month; Brod also offers complimentary haircuts, blow outs and spray tanning, all conducted in the fully equipped office salon.     The 65 women who work at the firm also have access to an endless supply of free beauty products that make the office look like an aisle at Sephora.     Hollywood actor and Australia's global tourism ambassador, Chris Hemsworth, is back in New York, inviting Americans Down Under.    Hemsworth signed on as Australia's ambassador in January of last year, launching the country's popular coastal and aquatic campaign.    Now he's back for a private "virtual tour" of Australia at an event Monday night, ahead of Australia Day on Thursday.     The event's invited guests include VIPs Naomi Watts, Deborra-Lee Furness and Rebecca Breeds, along with Aussie tourism minister Steve Ciobo.    Australia is seeing record visits by Americans. Arrivals from the US have crossed the 700,000 mark, reaching 705,000 in the past 12 months, up 18.3 percent.  
November 9, 2016	 The New York Post	  Donald Trump scored a stunning and historic upset victory in the presidential election Tuesday night, once again defying predictions and winning key battleground states to capture the White House.    Giddy supporters at the New York Hilton - who were sullen just hours earlier - erupted in cheers as the GOP nominee closed in on victory, chanting, "President Trump," "Drain the swamp," and "Lock her up!" about Hillary Clinton.    The celebration grew wilder still when TV monitors showed people crying at Clinton's party at the Jacob Javits Center.     "We won the presidency, the Senate and House. When's the last time that happened?" Rollins told The Post. "The polls were bad! Trump is going to be president. He's won this thing. He caught the wave of public discontent and rode it. Washington has to be stunned."    "If I can think of an analogous election, it would have to be Andrew Jackson. This is the people revolting against the Republican establishment," he said.     In a tweet posted earlier that night, Clinton seemed resigned to what had to be a heartbreaking upset after working for years to become the first female president in the nation's 240-year history.    Lena Dunham, the outspoken Clinton backer and "Girls" actress, was asked to comment about the election results as she left a Clinton VIP party at around 10:45 p.m.    "Somewhere, [Vladimir] Putin is laughing manically," another Clinton supporter said as others broke down in tears.    Neera Tanden, a Clinton confidante whose blunt e-mails were among those released by WikiLeaks, was spotted leaving the Javits Center at 11:05 pm.    Asked about the results, Tanden said: "I've been through a lot of battles with her, and I've seen her come out strong."    Asked about gloomy numbers coming out of Michigan and Wisconsin - blue states that are key to Clinton's survival - Tanden said, "We'll see how it goes."    "I honestly feel a piece of my soul died," said Katie Larson, a 25-year-old musician living in Manhattan. "We lost a piece of our dignity as Americans."    "After Brexit and this election, everything is possible from now on. A world collapsing before our eyes. Dizzying," tweeted Gerard Araud, French ambassador to the US.    Chinese state media described the election as the embodiment of America's democracy in crisis in contrast to China's stability under authoritarian rule.    The state-run Xinhua News Agency said the campaign highlighted that "the majority of Americans are rebelling against the US's political class and financial elites."    Argentine Foreign Minister Susana Malcorra said a win by Trump in the US election would stall recent moves to improve relations between the countries.     She said the "more closed, isolationist and xenophobic" model represented by the Trump would have a negative impact on the world and relations with Latin America.     Shervin Pishevar, co-founder of the venture-capital company Sherpa Capital, which helped fund Uber, Airbnb and Slack, tweeted that if Trump wins, he would start funding a campaign to allow California to secede from the US and form a new country.    The mood among Team Trump had soured after Clinton widened her lead in the polls following FBI Director James Comey's announcement Sunday that he would not be pursuing criminal charges over her email server.    "I will be watching the election results from Trump Tower in Manhattan with my family and friends. Very exciting!" Trump tweeted.   Trump did well in the South and Midwest, while Clinton ran stronger in the Northeast, easily winning New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and Massachusetts.    By 11 p.m., sales at the New York Hilton party's cash bar were brisk as Trump's prospects looked less grim.    It's looking "good" for Trump, George W. Bush's former strategist Mark McKinnon said inside the filled ballroom.    "I think this is really a significant movement," added Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Alabama), one of Trump's biggest boosters.    "I need every brain cell available," he said, adding that he anticipated getting grilled by the press.    Meanwhile, stock futures cratered, plunging 700 points at one point, and bonds rallied as the outcome of the election remained unclear.    Nervous traders questioned whether Clinton could win as expected. The Mexican peso fell sharply against the US dollar, reflecting Trump's bellicose warnings of tariffs and determination to build a wall along the southern border.    "I would say the market is a bit more cautious as it doesn't seem to be such a quick and decisive victory for Hillary as it seemed," Ian Lyngen, head of US rate strategy at BMO Capital Markets, told CNBC. "But it's not over, yet."     Clinton had the lead in most national polls heading into the election and in enough battleground states to get to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win. 
July 21, 2016	 The New York Post	  Nothing could be more boring to write about. I can hear you snoring already. But if Donald Trump becomes president, you will hear that word a lot. You'll especially hear it in connection with China.     Tariffs are the taxes placed on imported goods, usually when the other country has done something you don't like. Tariffs and taxes have caused wars in the past.     You know all about the Boston Tea Party, which led to the American Revolution. The Brits wanted to tax the colonists' tea.     Trump, who will accept the Republican Party nomination for president Thursday, has said that he'd like to impose 35 percent to 45 percent tariffs on goods coming into the US from Mexico and China.     A group of reporters from The Post met with Trump a few weeks ago at his self-named tower in Manhattan, and I asked him specifically about the punishment he plans for China.     He didn't back off the idea of a tariff. The Chinese, he said, want to do business with us and they will pay the tax. I pointed out that it could lead to a trade war - we tax them, they tax us - and then, just to top it off, the Chinese would start stealing more of our technology than they already have.     There's another aspect of that particular trade war that Trump ought to familiarize himself with quickly. And if nobody else does it, I will bring it to his attention. Perhaps he'll even read this column.     Right now, the Chinese own $1.3 trillion in US government bonds. That's the most of any foreign country, followed not so closely by Japan's $1.1 trillion. The US has total debt now exceeding $19 trillion, but much of that is held by the inaptly named Social Security Trust Fund and by US citizens.     That $1.3 trillion puts China in a very good position to be mischievous, especially in retaliation for Trump's threats and, later, his actions.     What could China do? It's already been selling large amounts of US bonds. But a massive dump of government securities - or even the threat of such a move - would cause interest rates to rise because Washington would have to find someone else to replace the Chinese as bond buyers.     Rising rates would cause the US economy to slow because money would cost more to borrow. It would also cause the government to pay more to borrow money, which would make our deficit larger.     And it would cause the value of the dollar to rise more than it already has. That would make our exports more expensive and imports - including those from China - more competitive with US products.     Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester does not believe that the Fed should drop money from a helicopter to boost the US economy. It was all a big misunderstanding between her and a reporter for the Australian Broadcasting Corp.     And that's a welcome piece of news because, as I said in last Thursday's column, that would be a shocking thing for someone on the Fed to suggest.    The way the press people at the Cleveland Fed explain it, Mester was asked a direct question about "helicopter" money by a reporter. She then started talking about the fact that the Fed may need to be more accommodative if the economy still doesn't show signs of life.     The reporter took that as a yes on helicopter money and the story - later corrected - went around the world. I didn't see the correction and that's probably because the Cleveland Fed did its best to hide the matter. Instead of a press release that would have had to repeat the helicopter controversy, the Cleveland Fed simply mentioned the mix-up on its Web site - not exactly where a lot of people would see it.     The Cleveland Fed also refused to answer some of my questions, especially: Why wasn't Mester clearer with her helicopter answer. For example, she could have just said, "No, that's not an option."     Perhaps she was trying to leave the helicopter option open? No response from the Cleveland Fed. And what was Fed Chair Janet Yellen's take on the whole controversy? No response.     I told you a couple of months ago that gasoline prices would drop this summer. And they have. Some prices in New Jersey are now in the $1.70s a gallon.     In fact, according to Jodie Gunzberg of S&P Dow Jones Indices, unleaded gasoline has hit its lowest July price levels since 2004 and is having its second-worst third-quarter start since 1988.     It's the "worst," of course, for the people who produce and sell gasoline. But that's great news for those of us who drive.     How'd I know this would happen? For one thing, gas futures contracts were falling even as speculators were driving up oil prices in spring. Oil prices have now also declined.     And I also knew because despite what people in Washington would like you to believe, economic growth still stinks. So the "peak" driving season was a little sickly - a little "peaked," if you will. 
May 24, 2016	 The New York Post	  Donald Trump has begun lining up candidates for the ultimate job interview - his vice- presidential running mate.    The presumptive Republican presidential nominee is considering a list that includes a retired general and some of Washington's most powerful lawmakers.    One of the most talked-about candidates on the billionaire's short list is Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, who met Monday with The Donald at Trump Tower in Manhattan.      Corker emerged from the 80-minute meeting claiming there was no reason to believe he's on Trump's short list - exactly what a VP candidate is supposed to say.    "We had actually never met before. . . We had a conversation," Corker told reporters. "It was a good meeting about foreign policy, domestic issues."    Corker, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he and Trump discussed US relations with China and Russia. Corker would bolster Trump's perceived weakness on foreign affairs.    Sources said Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions - one of Trump's earliest supporters - also is under consideration. Sessions' views on immigration match Trump's.    A surprise name on the list is retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a national security adviser to Trump who has emerged as one of the most buzzed about veep contenders, sources familiar with the deliberations said.    Flynn retired in 2014 after a 33-year career in military intelligence that included hunting down terrorists as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.    Flynn would be an out-of-the- box choice because Trump has strongly suggested he would likely select someone connected to Congress or with elective experience to be his veep.    "I think I'll probably go the political route," Trump said this month on MSNBC's Morning Joe. "Somebody that can help me with legislation and somebody that can help me get things passed and somebody that's been friends with the senators and the congressmen and all."    In February, Flynn said Hillary Clinton should drop out of the presidential race while the FBI investigated her use of a private e-mail server.   Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Monday declined to discuss specific names being considered for vice president.    We're not going to go down that route. Mr. Trump is going to be the person making the final decision," he said.    Lewandowsky emphasized that Trump prefers "someone with elective experience," which would make Flynn a dark horse.    He said Trump's meeting with Corker focused mostly on "foreign-policy discussions," not the vice presidency.    During a recent interview with Fox News host Greta Van Susteren, Trump suggested as many as seven candidates were on his veep list.    Meanwhile, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is pushing for consideration in the veepstakes, sources said.

November 12, 2016	 The New York Post	  Alibaba just published eye-popping results for its annual Singles Day sales bash - but it wasn't enough to offset the Trump factor.    The China-based e-commerce giant said it raked in nearly $17.8 billion during the splashy, 24-hour sales event Friday - a figure that easily dwarfs, for example, last year's tally of $3 billion in online sales across the US on Cyber Monday.     Still, Alibaba's stock dipped 1.4 percent on Friday, to $92.99, capping a three-day selloff that left the shares 7 percent lower.    The worry is that President-elect Donald Trump will follow through on his protectionist rhetoric against China, potentially crippling the Middle Kingdom's fast-growing, but fragile consumer economy.    "America and China cannot ignore each other," Joe Tsai, Alibaba's executive vice chairman, said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.     In addition to Tsai's tone of desperation, a few insiders saw other potential signs for worry for Alibaba as Trump organized his transition team from his aerie in Trump Tower.    The shopping shindig orchestrated by Alibaba's billionaire founder, Jack Ma - called Singles Day because it is held on Nov. 11, or 11/11 - was live-streamed Friday from a 60,000-seat stadium in Shenzhen and headlined by A-list stars like Scarlett Johansson, Kobe Bryant and David Beckham.    The originally scheduled headliner was pop star Katy Perry, who backed out at the last minute citing a family emergency.    "She could not make it out due to a family matter," Alibaba spokesman Bob Christie told The Post. "That's all we know."    That wasn't enough to quash speculation that Perry - a vocal Hillary Clinton supporter who tweeted, "WE WILL NEVER BE SILENCED" after Trump's victory - was removed from the Singles Day lineup by Alibaba because of Trump-related concerns.    "You could imagine that, under the circumstances, Katy Perry might be seen as whipping up the crowd with the wrong kind of message," one investor speculated.    Singles Day sales topped $1 billion during the first five minutes alone, kicking off sprees that easily surpassed last year's one-day total of $14.3 billion, according to the Chinese tech titan.     Still, those numbers are measured in what Alibaba calls "gross merchandise volume," or GMV - a term that has become fodder for short sellers who question whether it isn't larded with significant amounts of fake and canceled sales.    As reported by The Post, an investigation of Alibaba's accounting by the Securities and Exchange Commission, disclosed by the company in May, is being assisted by at least one whistleblower. 
December 4, 2016	 The New York Post	 China issued a formal diplomatic protest Saturday after Donald Trump took a call from the president of Taiwan, but congressional Republicans and diplomatic hard-liners applauded the Friday phone chat as a clear sign there's a new sheriff in town.    "Plaudits to president-elect Trump for his historic phone call to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen," tweeted Rep. Pete King (R-LI). "Strong message to China. New day in Asia."     Texas Sen. Ted Cruz chimed in, "I would much rather have Donald Trump talking to President Tsai than to Cuba's Raul Castro or Iran's Hasan Rouhani. This is an improvement."    Former UN Ambassador John Bolton - in the running to become Trump's secretary of state and someone who was present in Trump Tower on Friday - pooh-poohed critics' worries the call could undo decades of delicate diplomacy and lead to conflict between the superpowers.    "The president of the United States should talk to whomever he wants if he thinks it's in the interest of the United States, and nobody in Beijing gets to dictate who we talk to," he told Fox News on Saturday.     Bolton has pushed for closer relations with Taiwan and a tougher American stance against China's aggressive territorial claims in the South China Sea.    And Trump pointed out that the United States has continued its trade and defense relationships with Taiwan regardless of its official diplomatic status.    "Interesting how the US sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call," Trump wrote on Twitter.    Tony Nash, of the data-analysis firm Complete Intelligence, thinks the call is a sign of things to come.     He tweeted: "The Trump Taiwan call put China on defense after it's played offense w weaker neighbors for years. US policy in Asia will not be status quo."    Daniel Blumenthal of the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank, believes the phone call will not have much of an ­effect on relations between the two superpowers.     The White House, which was unaware of the phone call ahead of time, said that it changed nothing about the nation's "longstanding policy" on China and Taiwan.    The call broke nearly 40 years of strictly observed protocol. It was the first direct communication between a Taiwanese and US leader or leader-in-waiting since 1979, when President Jimmy Carter withdrew diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in favor of a US relationship with China.   China sees the island nation as a breakaway province and considers its democratically elected government illegitimate.    The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Saturday that it had lodged "stern representations" with the "relevant US side" - without saying whether that meant the US State Department or the Trump transition team.    In Trump's 10-minute talk with President Tsai, aides said, the two leaders "noted the close economic, political and security ties . . . between Taiwan and the United States" and congratulated one another on their recent ­victories.   Trump said on Twitter Friday that Tsai had initiated the call: "The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency." But aides to both leaders said the conversation was prearranged.    "Of course both sides agreed ahead of time before making contact," said a spokesman for Tsai, who was even photographed while speaking to Trump.    Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi initially made light of the incident despite his government's later formal objections, dismissing it as "a little trick" on ­Taiwan's part.     "This is just the Taiwan side engaging in a petty action and cannot change the 'One China' structure already formed by the international community," Wang said.    Social-media-fueled rumors that Trump had used the Taiwan call to promote his business interests there were flatly denied by his representatives Saturday, according to The Wall Street Journal.

June 23, 2016	 The New York Post	  Donald Trump launched a searing attack on Hillary Clinton on Wednesday, slamming her as "a world-class liar" who "may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States."    Speaking deliberately and reading from a teleprompter at his Soho hotel, Trump hammered Clinton as a failed secretary of state who can't be trusted on issues ranging from Middle East turmoil to immigration and trade.    "Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to ISIS, the barbarians. Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East and on the road to nuclear weapons," Trump said to a crowd of about 50 in the made-for-TV event.     "Hillary Clinton's tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign-policy disaster after another," he said, speaking in a moderate tone.    The uncharacteristically disciplined speech was Trump's first major address since shaking up his campaign in what promises to be a brutal battle for the White House.    It also came as the billionaire businessman faced growing questions about his readiness not only for the presidency, but for the race he will need to run to win given his bare-bones campaign operation.    Team Trump hoped the carefully scripted speech and modulated delivery would quiet those concerns and rally Republicans around their fierce opposition to Clinton.     He said the former first lady used her career in public life to get rich by cutting deals with brutal foreign regimes that then donated millions to her family's foundation or paid for Bill Clinton's speeches.    "She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund doing favors for oppressive regimes and many others and really many, many others in exchange for cash, pure and simple," Trump said.    He specifically took aim at the Clintons for raking in millions from Saudi Arabia and other countries that criminalize homosexuality.     As president, Trump added, Hillary would be controlled by Wall Street, CEOs and foreign governments who paid the Clintons to give speeches over the years.   Trump also accused Clinton of giving "China millions of our best jobs and effectively let China completely rebuild itself. In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!"    During the 45-minute speech, Trump pledged to "appoint judges who uphold the Constitution," reform the nation's immigration policies and repeal ObamaCare.   Trump continued with a laundry list of charges against Hillary and the Obama presidency - including the failure to maintain the country's infrastructure while making trade deals that cost American jobs.    "When I see the crumbling roads and bridges or dilapidated airports or factories moving overseas to Mexico or other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed but not by Hillary Clinton, only by me," he said.    He also appealed to Bernie Sanders' supporters to back him - and repeatedly questioned the presumptive Democratic nominee's honesty.    "Hillary Clinton, most people know, she's a world-class liar. Just look at her pathetic e-mail server statements or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack and the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total lie. This was one of the beauts," Trump said.    Clinton, speaking in North Carolina, said Trump was peddling "outlandish lies" and "reckless ideas that will run up our debt and cause another economic crash."   Trump's attacks, she said, were an effort to distract people from the issues. "That's why he's attacking my faith. Sigh," she said, referring to his comments a day earlier questioning her Christianity.     * "ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama."  
December 29, 2016	 The New York Post	  I made a very bold call last year in predicting that Donald Trump would win the presidency - or, more precisely, that Hillary Clinton would lose. I'm not feeling quite that daring, or lucky, when it comes to my outlook for the coming year.    But I'll still dip my little toe into the shallow end of the forecasting pool. So here goes nothin'.     I think the president-elect will start off smoothly in his relations with other Republicans - pomp and circumstance and all that. But unless Trump calms down both his rhetoric and his policies, there will be friction within just a few months.   Trump's comments on nuclear weapons proliferation will be only one major issue of contention. Even if other politicians agree with his view that the US can out-nuke anyone else in the world, that won't be an issue Trump is likely to get much public backing on.    That's not really a germane topic for this column. But there's another bombshell issue that is: the economy.    Trump has called for a massive spending program - mainly for infrastructure improvements throughout the US - that he says will get the economy moving again.     Great idea, if the new president has found a magic way to pay for all this spending that nobody else has thought of.     If he hasn't, any big spending bills are likely to be blocked in Congress. Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan simply aren't going to bend on this issue and Trump is going to come up with an empty wallet for his big plans.     Still, the very fact that Trump is talking about adding to the already massive $20 trillion US debt load will likely spook the financial markets eventually and cause interest rates to continue rising.     Despite common belief, most interest rates aren't really controlled by the Federal Reserve. Rates are dictated by the demand for money worldwide and concern over future inflationary pressures. And you can track that by looking at the bond market, where rates began rising months before the Fed's recent increase.    Trump's talk about spending massively will press the inflation button in the minds of the financial world. And that'll mean higher borrowing costs even if the Fed backtracks (as I think it will) on its promise of three rate hikes next year.     For years I've been ranting about Chinese goods, especially counterfeits, coming into the US. But this isn't the time for Trump to begin this battle.     Right now the Chinese own about $1.35 trillion in US debt. In recent months, the Chinese have been selling some of that debt, although the reasons for the sales are unclear.     If Beijing were to decide to sell more or all of its US holdings and, worse, not buy any more debt, interest rates in the US would go up.    If Trump continues to antagonize China and causes retaliation, there's no telling what kind of chaos might happen in interest rates.    Most Americans didn't like Russia messing with the election. They aren't going to like China fooling with our financial markets any better.     If, by luck, the world economy suddenly starts to perk up at the same time the US is still hearing about Trump's spending plans, interest rates could go ballistic.     Well, anyone who lived through the rate hikes of the early 1980s knows that it can happen. Back then, interest rates became double-digit quickly.     A number of things will occur if that happens. One, many of those people who have been forced into the stock market might suddenly find the high interest rates in bonds much more appealing. So, stock prices will go down.    When similar messes were about to happen - like when the Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell nearly 800 points on election night as Trump's victory became clear - someone came to the markets' rescue.    Another rescue effort could happen if all the dark forces I mentioned above conspired against the financial markets. Or there might be no rescue the next time.    One of the smartest moves for any incoming president is to acknowledge all the problems up front. Trump would be wise, for instance, to allow the economy to weaken if that's what it is doing anyway without any heroic rescue efforts.     And the same goes for the financial markets. If stocks and bonds get routed, Trump can again blame his predecessor. 
November 13, 2016	 The New York Post	  When Donald Trump said last week that he will double the American growth rate, his skeptics scoffed. The left doesn't think 4 percent growth is possible because they never came close to that target under Obama.     But there's no law of nature or economics that says America is doomed to anemic growth rates. We believe with the right policy fixes that fast growth is not just possible, but probable.    In the 1980s the Reagan agenda had quarterly growth rates of 6, 7 and even 8 percent. One month recorded 1 million new jobs. Now that's a recovery. And Trump is right that if India and China can grow at 8 to 10 percent, surely we can aspire to half that growth rate.    Faster growth of the economy is imperative if America is to retain our world superpower status - especially given the new rivalry of fast-growing China. This requires the new Trump plan, which will take American competitiveness seriously.    First, Trump will enact the biggest pro-growth tax cut since Ronald Reagan's 1981 reform. Trump will simplify the tax code and significantly reduce marginal rates, encouraging investment and economic expansion. His proposed corporate tax rate of 15 percent would make it easier for American firms to repatriate earnings, bringing capital back to these shores.    The House tax bill is similar to Trump's. We can get this through Congress in the first 150 days. The Tax Foundation says this will add about $150 billion in higher output.    Next, a pro-growth energy policy would develop all of America's abundant resources - oil, natural gas and coal. Trump's plan could make America the world's No. 1 energy producer within five years, producing millions of new jobs and trillions of dollars of extra output - along with new royalty payments to the government. And we will not waste hundreds of billions of dollars subsidizing 500 million solar panels - mostly built in China.    ObamaCare is Obama-Gone. It's the fastest-growing entitlement program of all, and it will be replaced with a consumer-choice health plan. This will cut costs for families and businesses by as much as 30 percent.    On the regulatory front, Trump wants to immediately repeal dozens of President Obama's anti-business executive orders. At the top of the stack to go in the dust bin is the clean power plant law that has put tens of thousands of our coal miners out of work.   Trump would also bring an America-first, pro-business approach to economic policy. Having someone in the White House who knows how to run a business and meet a payroll has to be a psychological lift for this battered and bruised economy. 
November 15, 2016	 The New York Post	  Tech stocks on Monday got whacked for a fourth straight day as investors braced for a possible trade war with China under a Donald Trump presidency.    A get-tough strategy with China could lead to stiff tariffs being placed on products imported from that country - hurting sales.     Tech giants like Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet are down sharply since Trump's Nov. 8 victory.    Apple shares bore the brunt of the downdraft on Monday, falling 2.5 percent, after a government-controlled newspaper in China warned that "iPhone sales will suffer a setback" if Trump follows through on campaign threats to "wreck" US-China trade relations.    The NYSE-listed shares of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant led by billionaire Jack Ma, were also battered, falling 3.5 percent - and are down more than 10 percent since Election Day.    The Apple selloff came despite pleas from analysts that the iPhone maker, which holds more than $230 billion in cash overseas, could be the biggest beneficiary of Trump's proposal to dangle tax breaks for companies looking to repatriate their holdings.    Shares of Amazon - whose billionaire boss Jeff Bezos had joked before the election about using one of his rockets to send Trump into space - lost 2.7 percent Monday, to close at $719.07.    That capped a losing streak that has left Amazon down 8.7 percent since Trump's election - a bloodbath that slashed nearly $6 billion from Bezos's paper wealth, leaving him with just $62.9 billion.    Elsewhere, shares of Facebook and Google parent Alphabet may have gotten slammed simply because they were tech stocks, as money managers dumped them to chase more Trump-friendly sectors, including banks, pharmaceuticals and defense.    "It appears to be a bit of a rotation among sectors," said Kevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management.     Also hard hit were Tesla Motors and SolarCity, whose proposal to merge is coming to a vote later this week.  
May 31, 2016	 The New York Post	The Issue: President Obama's recent claim that foreign leaders say they're concerned about a Trump presidency.    President Obama is correct that Donald Trump has foreign leaders nervous ("Bam: Don has world leaders on edge," May 17).      The leaders of China, Russia, Iran, ISIS, Cuba and all the other traditional bad guys Obama bows down to are worried that Trump will no longer let them get away with their threats against the United States and our allies.     Obama's treasured legacy will melt away very quickly if Trump wins, and he knows it. Already, Obama acts as though he himself is campaigning for a third term.      Given Obama's famous narcissism, it's possible that Obama may do whatever it takes to keep Trump from the presidency.     Obama's right. Iran's probably worried about what will happen the next time it abuses US sailors. Russia's no doubt nervous about whether it can continue to buzz US warships and planes. And China may have to stop building military bases in the South China Sea.     I bet Mexico is surely in a tizzy, wondering how on Earth it's going to pay for that border wall.     The fact is, Obama and many foreign leaders share the same fear: Trump will make America great again. 
January 24, 2017	 The New York Post	  Two days after he used inaccurate numbers to excoriate the media over reports about the crowds at President Trump's inauguration, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told a packed briefing room Monday that he intends to always speak the truth.    "I believe that we have to be honest with the American people," Spicer said in his first full-blown press conference.       "I think sometimes we can disagree with the facts. There are certain things that we may not fully understand when we come out, but our intention is never to lie to you."    The presidential spokesman also doubled down on his statement Saturday that Trump's swearing-in garnered the highest number of viewers ever.    "It was the most-watched inauguration. On one network, there were tens of millions of people that watched online," he said. "It's unquestionable. I don't see any numbers that dispute that.    "If we make a mistake, we'll do our best to correct it," Spicer added, warning journalists that their relationship with the White House is a "two-way street."    When asked about his false statement Saturday that the Washington Metro system recorded more riders on the day of the inauguration than when ex-President Barack Obama was sworn in for his second term, he said he provided the best numbers available.     Spicer said he'd been given incorrect information about the ridership but insisted that - when TV and online viewership are combined - it was the most-watched inaugural in history.    According to Nielsen ratings, however, Trump's inauguration fell short of the top TV viewership, with Ronald Reagan's 1980 event at No. 1.    Moving to foreign affairs, Spicer said that Trump, who spoke with his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, is committed to providing military assistance to that country.   Trump "underscored the United States remain committed to the bilateral relationship which helped both countries overcome challenges in the region for decades," Spicer said.    Washington's annual $1.3 billion in military aid for Egypt was briefly suspended under Obama in 2013, after the ouster of then-President Mohamed Morsi, but was reinstated in 2015.    n The Trump administration is willing to partner with Russia to combat ISIS. Trump has been "very clear" that he will "work with any country committed to defeating ISIS," Spicer said.    n The administration vowed that the US will prevent China from taking over territory in international waters in the South China Sea. "I think the US is going to make sure that we protect our interests there," Spicer said. "It's a question of, if those islands are, in fact, in international waters and not part of China proper, then yeah, we're going to make sure that we defend international territories from being taken over by one country."    n Illegal immigrants with criminal records will be targeted for a stepped-up deportation drive promised by Trump.    "People who can do harm or have done harm and have a criminal record are the focus," Spicer said when asked about the future of a program that shields from deportation undocumented immigrants who arrived as children.    n Trump, who has made creating American manufacturing jobs a centerpiece of the early days of his term, will be hosting breakfast at the White House with the heads of Ford, GM and Chrysler on Tuesday. Spicer did not reveal the specific agenda.    n  The White House will designate four "Skype seats" in the press briefing room as part of its plan for a more "diverse group of journalists" to ask questions.  
May 29, 2016	 The New York Post	  As Barack Obama enters the twilight of his reign of error, he is still doing things his peculiar way. A craven deal to bring Iran's mad mullahs in from the cold, a visit to Castro's Cuba, hugs for nuclear survivors in Hiroshima.     At home he is shutting down coal mines and throwing open America's borders and schoolhouse bathrooms. He rarely bothers to pretend that Congress matters anymore, with every executive action a headline-grabbing dare to the courts to stop him.      Each day brings a new notch on the legacy belt as he appears determined to do things just to prove he can. History will sort the wheat from the chaff, but the short-term impact of Obama's eight years can be summed up in two words: ­Donald Trump.    Obama begat Trump. Without Obama's mixture of breathtaking arrogance and stunning incompetence, there is no constituency or emotional space for a Trump.     A year ago, that would have been a preposterous claim. Yet at this remarkable juncture, with Trump having secured the GOP nomination, it all seems obvious now. Trump is the inevitable reaction to the blundering Obama colossus.     I say that not because Trump is the most likely of all Americans to fix what Obama broke, though he will have to try. Rather, Trump, in his own peculiar way, is Obama's doppelganger.     Both are radicals. Obama's radicalism is revealed through his policies, while Trump's is revealed through his personality. They are as different as night and day, yet they are like two sides of the same coin.    Obama voters got the president they wanted - 51 percent of the country still approves of his performance. Now the other half seems determined to have its Big Daddy president.   Trump's policies remain a mystery, but that's hardly a first for a nominee. Obama was not the unifying president he vowed to be, with a poll in his first term finding that 54 percent of the country thought he was far more liberal than anticipated. The people were right - he leaves the Democratic Party far, far to the left of where it was eight years ago.    But it's more than Obama's extreme partisanship and identity politics that paved the way for Trump. It's also that Obama solved no serious problems facing the country, and turned some into full-blown disasters.    He doubled the national debt, the economy is stuck in neutral, and instead of cooling race relations, he turned them into a bonfire - the bonfire of Obama's vanities.    Nor is it incidental that the world is on fire. By abdicating America's leadership role, Obama created the vacuum that China, Russia and ­malignant forces everywhere are rushing to fill. Could anyone possibly do worse?   Trump, of course, still must vanquish Hillary Clinton to complete the pendulum's full swing. Polls showing the race tied reflect the nation's mood, but the Electoral College is what matters, and Dems hold a clear advantage.    In 2012, with 270 electoral votes needed, Obama got 332 to Mitt Romney's 206. Recent polls showing a dead heat in three key swing states - Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio - pointed a possible path to GOP victory.     While neither Trump nor Clinton is trusted and liked by a majority of Americans, Trump's advantage is that he is the far better candidate and generates wild enthusiasm. Clinton is a dud on the trail, and her e-mail scandal, compounded by the inspector general report showing she's been lying to the public all along, makes her baggage almost unbearable.    But beyond the Electoral College advantage, Clinton has a better organization than Trump. Her campaign and super PACs are way ahead in fund-raising and ad buys, while Trump can't make up his mind about how much money he'll need and how to get it. His firing of a top aide reveals a continuing ­turmoil that should have been ­resolved by now.     All things considered, Clinton enters the summer as the front-runner for the general election. Although Bernie Sanders is still scrapping for the nomination and the FBI has not had its say, she's likely to survive both challenges.    Trump is the only Republican who could beat her, but it won't be pretty. Because he's a street fighter and her tenacity is as strong as her character is crooked, the squeamish should turn away now. A brutal slugfest is guaranteed. 
December 3, 2016	 The New York Post	  Donald Trump took a call from Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen on Friday, ending nearly 40 years of diplomatic silence between the US and the island off China.     No US president or president-elect has spoken with a Taiwanese leader since 1979, in deference to mainland China, which considers Taiwan its territory.    It was unclear whether Team Trump was signaling a broad change in US policy or if the chat was a spontaneous gesture of friendliness.   China's foreign minister responded by saying he hopes Beijing-Washington relations won't be "interfered with or damaged."    "The one-China policy is the cornerstone of the healthy development of China-US relations and we hope this political foundation will not be interfered with or damaged," Wang said. 
November 19, 2016	 The New York Post	  Candidate Donald Trump repeatedly vowed to get rid of the nation's top senior military officials within 30 days of taking office. But that, warns The Washington Post's Josh Rogin, "could provoke a crisis in civil-military relations at the very beginning of his presidency." For one thing, "an immediate and thorough housecleaning could provoke pushback from the military and accusations of political interference." Moreover, "a purge of generals based on their willingness to support a president's policies would be a dangerous endeavor that flew in the face of military culture and tradition." But "if Trump does decide to dismiss generals in an unprecedented way, there's not much that could be done to stop him."   Trump has been president-elect for barely a week, and "the same pundits who said he could never win are making it sound like his presidency has already failed," writes James S. Robbins in USA Today. They say his transition is in disarray, he hasn't produced "a set of developed proposals" and is backing away from campaign positions. Yet before his own inauguration, Bill Clinton "managed to flip-flop on his China policy, water down his promised middle-class tax cut and abandon his pledge to admit Haitian refugees." Plus, two of his Cabinet picks were mired in scandal. Meanwhile, "Trump is sprinting down the track compared with Ronald Reagan's laid-back transition." Says Robbins: "People in a hurry to declare Trump's presidency failed should at least have the courtesy to first let it begin."    The incoming president should turn for advice to someone who's been dead for more than 50 years - Gen. Douglas MacArthur, "who actually has a lot in common with Donald Trump and should be one of his role models." That's the judgment of MacArthur biographer Arthur Herman, writing for Fox News. Like Trump, the hero of World War II and Korea "was a maverick, an anti-establishment figure" who faced the "opposition of America's political elites, who saw him as vain and arrogant." Herman suggests the general would offer these four pieces of advice, based on his own experience: "First, stand your ground." Second, "trust your gut." Third, "know your enemy." And finally, "keep your word."    Warren Harding was "a problematic president" who "wasn't particularly well-qualified" for the job, notes William Kristol in The Weekly Standard. But there's one way in which he was impressive - and it's a lesson Trump should learn: "His administration was stocked with (mostly) well-qualified men who served with considerable distinction." Kristol cites Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes and Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, "whose tax reforms and deregulatory efforts spurred years of economic growth." Moreover, his "first two Supreme Court appointments - William Howard Taft and George Sutherland - were distinguished." Trump should focus on Harding's successes, but also his "failures, particularly the scandals that exploded into public view after Harding's sudden death" - scandals caused by "cronies" who "betrayed his trust and tarnished his reputation."    If Trump's victory does nothing else, it should put to rest the hoary argument that "money buys elections," writes former Federal Elections Commissioner Bradley Smith in The Washington Examiner. After all, "Clinton's campaign outspent Trump by more than two-to-one. Pro-Clinton ads outnumbered pro-Trump ads by three-to-one. Independent groups (the 'super PACs') supporting Clinton outspent independent groups supporting Trump by three-to-one." And even before 2016, well-heeled candidates like Jon Corzine, Meg Whitman and Linda McMahon had lost races. Fact is, "money is simply the facilitator by which candidates speak to voters, but voters will make up their own minds." And "money simply can't make up for a message that people aren't interested in." - Compiled by Eric Fettmann 
January 10, 2017	 The New York Post	  Michael Ledeen at PJ Media says Donald Trump can send a powerful message by inviting an Iranian ayatollah to his inauguration. Specifically, Ayatollah Hossain Boroujerdi, recently released from prison after a decade behind bars. Boroujerdi "is one of those dissidents who are so beloved by the Iranian people that the murderous regime of Ali Khamenei does not dare to put them to death or even on trial." He has "repeatedly criticized the fundamentalist doctrines of the Iranian theocratic state, and has dramatically spoken about the most explosive issues in the Muslim world, including anti-Semitism." Inviting him to the inauguration would "deliver a stunning message to the Islamic world" and "show that we understand that there are freedom-loving Muslims."    Chinese leaders "have been remarkably quiet" since the election, despite Donald Trump signaling that "his administration will pursue policies fundamentally disadvantageous" to Beijing, notes Gordon Chang at The National Interest. Some suspect they're "merely lying in wait, but there are signs they have themselves been ambushed and still do not know how to react to Trump." His two immediate predecessors "pursuing misguided approaches, tried to minimize" China's initial provocations. But Trump, by publicly taking a call from Taiwan's president, "turned the tables on Beijing, striking the Chinese even before the swearing-in." As a result, he's "unnerving overly confident Chinese officials." The Chinese "have just met someone impossible for them to intimidate."    An important word is missing from the joint intelligence report on Russia's alleged election-based cyberattacks, notes Andrew McCarthy at National Review: "Podesta." And the failure to even mention Hillary Clinton's campaign chief, John Podesta, whose e-mails were hacked, is "significant . . . in light of the intelligence community's recent history of politicizing its analyses." Because "influencing elections" usually means disinformation, not publicizing "true but embarrassing information." And the report "pointedly declines to tell us what specific information gives them such 'high confidence' " Vladimir Putin was behind it. In fact, it "concludes that while Putin appears to have been rooting for Trump," Moscow "assumed Clinton was going to win" and was "mainly trying to undermine . . . her anticipated presidency, not swing the election to Trump."    Heather Mac Donald at City Journal disagrees with those "incensed at the suggestion that the Black Lives Matter movement could have influenced the behavior of the four individuals in Chicago who tortured a disabled white man for hours." In fact, she says, the blame lies with "the reign of racial victimology, inner-city gang culture and black anti-white animus." Because "we live in Ta-Nehesi Coates's America, characterized by the assumption that blacks are the eternal targets of lethal white oppression." And Black Lives Matter is "just a more in-your-face manifestation" of this concept. She says "the establishment typically looks the other way at manifestations of black anti-white animus." But "the violence in the Chicago torture video does not arise in a vacuum."    People who want less immigration - 38 percent in a recent Gallup Poll, versus 21 percent who want more - traditionally "have been underrepresented in the US Congress," argues Ramesh Ponnuru at Bloomberg View. Now Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) appears to be succeeding Attorney General-designate Jeff Sessions "as the Senate's foremost immigration restrictionist." Yes, he overstates his case, but "he's probably right" when he says that "low-skilled immigration puts downward pressure on wages at the bottom of the labor market and that reducing it would relieve that pressure." It would "help low-wage workers and promote assimilation and social cohesion."  
December 5, 2016	 The New York Post	   President-elect Donald Trump launched a Twitter attack against China on several issues Sunday - as reports emerged saying that his controversial call with Taiwan was meant to be an intentional slap in the face to the communist nation.      Several insiders who helped plan Friday's historic chat told The Washington Post that Trump had been secretly plotting to provoke the superpower for months and that the conversation with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen had been in the works for weeks.    "They knew that there would be reaction and potential blowback," Stephen Yates, a former national-security official and expert on China and Taiwan, told The Post.     "Once the call was scheduled, I was told that there was a briefing for President-elect Trump," he said.    A spokesman from President Tsai's office added, "Of course both sides agreed ahead of time before making contact."    The call between the United States and Taiwan - a diplomatic first since 1979 - was part of Trump's new strategy to send a message to China that the new president intended to play rough, the insiders said.    Right after the billionaire won the election, his campaign team began compiling a list of foreign leaders to speak with in the weeks to follow, and the Chinese rival was reportedly one of his top choices.    Meanwhile, Trump fired off a pair of tweets Sunday - blasting China for devaluing America's currency and taxing US products - which seemed to reflect his new strategy.    "Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?" Trump wrote at about 5:30 p.m. "I don't think so!"     The "military complex" reference was apparently aimed at an artificial reef the Chinese have built in the South China Sea that can support a military base.     "China is the big abuser,"he said during the campaign, calling Beijing and other nations "grand masters at monetary manipulation."    Sunday's tweets came after China lodged a complaint with the United States on Saturday over the call with Taiwan. China considers Taiwan to be part of its nation, and in deference to that, the United States has walked a fine line and not had top-level talks with Taiwanese leaders in a generation.    The Trump camp has chosen to downplay the phone call, with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and aides coming to Trump's defense Sunday.     "He took the call, accepted her congratulations and good wishes and it was precisely that," Pence said Sunday on ABC's "This Week."    Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, Trump's former campaign manager, told "Fox News Sunday" that "it was just a phone call." 
February 7, 2016	 The New York Post	  Long before Donald Trump stamped his name in gold on buildings around the world, posted snarky midnight tweets and joined the race for the White House, he was New York's most important and bravest real-estate developer.     Whatever you think about his political views or crazy campaign, Trump doesn't get enough credit for being a transformative planner who is in love with the city.    No matter how many times they watch "Taxi Driver," younger New Yorkers and older ones who arrived recently have no idea of what the city was actually like in the mid-1970s through the mid-'90s. Notwithstanding Studio 54 and a short-lived Wall Street boom, the metropolis was reeling. Rampant street crime, AIDS, corporate flight and physical decay brought confidence to an all-time low.   Trump waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out.    Except in Battery Park City, which was then as remote as an offshore island, few other developers built anything but plain-vanilla office and apartment buildings. Trump - almost by force of will - rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead.     Many of his brainstorms were ahead of their time. Some - like his struggle beginning in the early 1970s to build what's now called Riverside South - were so far ahead, it can be hard to connect the dots between Trump's works and the neighborhood transformations they spawned and inspired years later.    His brick-and-mortar milestones are lost on those who know him mainly as a cartoonish TV personality, or are weary of his self-promotion and his omnipresent name on hotels, golf courses and casinos around the world.   Trump himself is largely to blame for being a prophet without honor in his home city. He grew weary of the risky, time-consuming development grind and started selling his name to just about any developer willing to sign a check. The result was horrible projects like the Trump Soho Hotel which he neither built nor owns.     His disastrous foray into Atlantic City casinos - Why, Donald? - his tacky promotion of China-made shirts and ties among other goofy ventures further cheapened his name.    The regrettable result is that Trump's true legacy is obscured in pointless scrutiny of what he "really owns" and schadenfreude over setbacks such as losing the Plaza Hotel and the Riverside South complex which he brought into being. (Trump was a better developer than he was a dealmaker, his books on the subject to the contrary.)    A more enlightened yardstick would measure what Trump created and how the projects lifted all boats around them. It's time to commemorate them before he's lost to the presidency - or to the mercy of late-night TV comedians. 
December 20, 2016	 The New York Post	 China's willingness to return a US Navy underwater drone it seized in the South China Sea "should not be the end of the saga," writes Gordon Chang in The Daily Beast. "Washington must impose costs on Beijing for what constituted an act of piracy - and an act of war." In fact, he says, the seizure "is only the latest act in a course of belligerent conduct spanning this century" by China against the US. Yet President Obama "cannot even talk about Chinese aggression." So "Beijing now thinks it can, with impunity, do whatever it wants wherever it wants."    Much is being made of the fact that many of Trump's Cabinet picks "have key philosophical differences with the missions of the agencies they have been tapped to run," notes David French at National Review, the fear being that "they don't want to lead their agencies so much as [to] 'dismantle' them." Says French: "Many on the left think this is a terrible thing. I think it's fabulous." That's because the critics "are wrongly equating the agency's very mission with the progressive policies they favor." But "the Obama administration didn't have the popular support to pass its agenda through Congress, so it went around Congress on a massive scale, including through executive actions and regulatory rulemakings." Now that's all "subject to repeal."    Marc Thiessen in The Washington Post takes Obama to task for his "chutzpah" in criticizing his successor for skipping his daily intelligence briefings: "This coming from the same person who skipped more than half of his daily intelligence briefings in his first term." Indeed, "not only did Obama commit the same malpractice," he "used the same excuses as Donald Trump to justify it": that he was regularly briefed by his national-security team. Asks Thiessen: "So Obama could rely on other national security briefings, but Trump cannot?" As for ridicule of Trump for saying he's "a smart person," Obama's NSC spokesman said his boss didn't need briefings because he's "among the most sophisticated consumers of intelligence on the planet." As it happens, says Thiessen, they're both wrong: "They do need briefers."    Buck Ryan of the University of Kentucky's First Amendment Center writes in the Lexington Herald Leader that he recently was disciplined for "sexual misconduct." His crime? "Singing a Beach Boys tune covered by Alvin and the Chipmunks." The tune was the classic "California Girls," which the university's Title IX coordinator ruled "included 'language of a sexual nature' and was somehow offensive." Ryan sang the song for students at a Chinese university, using local places instead of the original American ones. "UK's three-month investigation of my case revealed no student complaints," but his punishment "bans me from receiving international travel funds and strips me of a prestigious award worth thousands of dollars." And "when I inquired about my due process rights, I was told by the provost that I didn't have any."    Leonid Bershidsky at Bloomberg is unimpressed with Facebook's announced plan for combatting "fake news." The site will "effectively outsource the fact-checking of news stories flagged by users as possibly fake to third-party groups" that sign "a code developed at the Poynter Institute." But that undermines Facebook's "own impartiality and may open the way for censorship on social networks." For one thing, "Facebook's choice of partner immediately cuts off a large swath of conservative readers. Poynter's International Fact-Checking Network, home to the code of principles, is funded, among other donors, by George Soros's Open Society Foundations," raising the issue of "partisan bias." And many of the groups "sometimes disagree about the veracity of the same statement" - because "truth is sometimes complicated and multilayered." - Compiled by Eric Fettmann 
January 20, 2017	 The New York Post	  Will President Trump's foreign policy look more like the outgoing president's, or that of Obama's hero, Franklin Roosevelt?    In 1945, the World War II winners - Josef Stalin, Winston Churchill and FDR - met in Yalta, Crimea, to shape the fate of postwar Europe. US-led victory made America the world's top player, and its wealthiest. We became a global force for good.    A stark contrast with what will be on display next week, when Russian, Iranian and Turkish officials will meet in Astana, Kazakhstan. They'll try to end the civil war in Syria, which has led to the deaths of half a million and empowered the region's extremists, and in the process reshaped the Mideast.     President Obama talked a lot about the five-year Syrian war. Russia, Turkey and Iran acted. Which is why they convened the Astana summit, and are calling the shots.    Obama fans in Washington, Oslo or at the United Nations still believe he regained the world's respect after Bush's America lost it. That's not how it's seen in Aleppo, and that's not what our allies believe.    Though he took a liking to the phrase "America first" during the campaign, he'll have to avoid slipping into the isolationist baggage the slogan comes with. Trump's national-security team is certainly starting on the right track by pushing to beef up the military budgets Obama has depleted. Let's hope it succeeds.    Projecting military power is one way to avoid war. And a revamped military will be crucial to reclaiming America's rightful place on the world stage.    Take China. As its military expanded in the last decade, ours shrank. President Xi Jinping became increasingly aggressive, threatening neighbors, annexing territory and dominating the seas around him. Obama's "pivot to Asia" turned out to be an empty slogan, giving Chinese adventurism a (mostly) green light to make mischief.    Taking a post-election phone call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen shocked the buttoned-up diplomats at Foggy Bottom, but it also signaled to Xi that he can no longer do as he pleases in the region. That there's a new sheriff in town.    As for our allies: Trump will need to leave his campaign attacks on Japan, America's strongest and most reliable friend in the region, behind. Hopefully, his Trump Tower meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe shortly after the election will, as quickly as possible, be followed up by a bilateral US-Japanese trade agreement to replace Obama's ill-fated multinational Asian trade pact.    "Multinational trade pacts don't work," a European diplomat told me recently. Trump agrees - he was making that argument from the beginning, in fact. Which is why he's promising a bilateral pact with Britain's Theresa May, who announced she was moving her country full speed ahead toward its break with the European Union last week. Such agreements could reshape world trade.    Closer to home, Trump would do well to bury the hatchet with another friend, Mexico, assuring it doesn't turn into a foe.    Trump, as his Twitter account will attest, smiles at friends and hard-hits dissers. It's not a bad mode of statecraft, were he to expand it: He should communicate quite clearly who are our allies and who aren't.    Which one is Putin's Russia? As an astute Muscovite observes, the Kremlin adored Presidents Bush and Obama when they were elected, only to hate them by the time they left office. The love affair with Trump "is already beginning to fade," he said, predicting an ugly breakup soon.   Trump indicated on the campaign trail that (like Obama) he'd farm out to Russia some of our fights around the world. He'll soon realize, likely, that Moscow's animosity toward America is too deep for meaningful cooperation.    A self-proclaimed artist of the deal, Trump is fond of saying that unpredictability is strength. So it's hard to predict whether our future summits will look more like Astana or Yalta. Only the latter will make America great again. 
April 5, 2016	 The New York Post	  Donald Trump's wife, Melania, hit the campaign trail with him Monday on the eve of the Wisconsin primary, standing by her man as he weathers a series of storms over women's issues.      "No matter who you are, a man or a woman, he treats everyone equal," Melania told supporters in Milwaukee. "He's a fighter. As you may know by now, when you attack him, he will punch back 10 times harder."    Melania's speech came at a critical time for Trump, who has taken heat for comments about abortion, Ted Cruz's wife, and a female reporter who was allegedly assaulted by his campaign manager.    Melania, a former model, also talked up her spouse on Fox News, saying he has a good heart, but she wishes he'd act more presidential.    "But sometimes he just, like, he cannot stand if somebody attacks . . . So I say stay away from retweets.    The Emerson College survey also showed Bernie Sanders with a 51 to 43 percent lead over Hillary Clinton - who abandoned campaigning in Wisconsin to make a stand in her home state of New York.    The Emerson poll showed Cruz beating Trump 40 percent to 35 percent. While that would appear to be good news for the Texas senator, a Fox Business News poll on Thursday showed him ahead by 10 points, 42 to 32 percent.     Meanwhile, speaking earlier in La Crosse, Trump denounced "experts," saying they had made a mess of the world and suggested he might be better off without them.    "You look at what China's doing in the South China Sea, and they say, 'Oh, Trump doesn't have experts,' " he said, while defending his own controversial positions on foreign policy.     "You know, I've always wanted to say this. I've never said this before with all the talking we all do. All of these experts, 'Oh, we need an expert.' The experts are terrible."     Clinton, meanwhile, touted her home region as a possible end point for the campaign during swings through Manhattan and Albany to meet with Democratic lawmakers.    "She said if she wins big in New York [on April 19], it's over, " said Assemblyman José Rivera (D-Bronx).  
September 18, 2016	 The New York Post	  Of all the unforced errors Hillary Clinton's made so far, calling half of Trump supporters "a basket of deplorables" is possibly her most misguided.    Aside from falling prey to juvenile name-calling, Clinton presumes that this swath of the electorate uniformly holds, and is animated by, racist views.    Last Tuesday, four days after Clinton made that remark - at a star-studded gala in Manhattan, where Barbra Streisand performed - the Census Bureau released new data about jobs and the economy.     "Incomes Are Up Sharply; Poor Gain Most," said The New York Times, adding "the middle class and poor had a great year in 2015."    According to the Census Bureau, US households gained 5.2 percent in income in 2015 - the largest increase since the bureau began reporting such data in 1967.    That percentage sounds impressive, until you realize what it means in dollars and cents: an extra $2,798 in household income that year.    Buried further down in many of these breathless reports: This sudden soar in middle-class incomes is actually 1.6 percent less than in 2007, the last year before the economy collapsed.    The richest 5 percent of the country continue to flourish, with a 21.8 percent jump in income. The top 5 percent reported over $350,000 in earnings - up 4.9 percent from 1999 and nearly 40 percent more than 1989.    Meanwhile, the poorest Americans - 14.8 percent of the total population, or 46.7 million - are even poorer than they were in 1989.    The highest household incomes were reported in Maryland and Washington, DC - at an average of $75,000 - while Mississippi reported the lowest, at $40,539. Mississippi's incomes haven't budged since 2014.    Is it any wonder that average Americans - and to be average is to be struggling - feel career politicians in Washington, DC, don't care about them?    " 'Basket of deplorables' is incredibly reductionist," says J.D. Vance, author of the bestselling memoir "Hillbilly Elegy."    "Like a lot of people on the left, Hillary seems to want to put the Trump phenomenon on racial anxiety," he says. (Vance, who grew up working class in the Rust Belt and Appalachia, identifies as a conservative Republican and is unsure how he'll vote in November.) "It's a really oversimplified way to address the concerns of millions of people who feel invisible to elites."    These people, as Vance well knows, worry that their jobs are disappearing, never to return. They worry that as the rich get richer, they'll be relegated to a hidden, permanent underclass that no politician, president or government agency will want to acknowledge.    Despite his own problematic and incendiary rhetoric, Trump has expertly hit the marrow of the white working class: the anxiety, the dread, the suspicion that they are being lied to and left behind.    "Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment," Trump said after winning the New Hampshire primary in February. "The number's probably 28, 29 . . . in fact, I even heard recently 42 percent."    Even The New York Times admitted Trump was right: If we count the unemployed, underemployed and those who have simply given up looking for work - which the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not - 40.4 percent of Americans were unemployed as of January 2016.    "They're worried that their future won't be better, and their kids will do worse," Vance says. "That's the big economic fear that drives people. When a group asserts themselves politically" - as the uneducated white working class has - "people pay attention."    Among this group, Trump has consistently led Clinton by 58 percent-39 percent through 2016. These voters composed 44% of the electorate in 2012, and more than 70 percent of them say they're going to vote for the Republican candidate.    Whether everything Trump says is factually correct or is irrelevant to this group. He's speaking to the plight of joblessness, the effects of free trade and globalization, the death of unions - the tragedies that so viscerally, brutally affect these voters and their families, ones that Washington continues to spin as not so bad. Or, this week, super-fantastic news.    "The longer picture's pretty grim," says Ryan Avent, senior editor at The Economist and author of the new book "The Wealth of Humans: Work, Power and Status in the Twenty-First Century." "It's not a case of, 'Stuff we've tried in the past is going to work.' Technology and globalization have changed the world that workers are facing . . . Is this whole segment of the population going to go off in this direction and become isolated?"    A spate of recent books warn of this very likelihood: In addition to Vance's and Avent's, Nancy Isenberg's "White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America" and Nicholas Eberstadt's "Men Without Work: America's Invisible Crisis" also explore this specific crisis.    "It's astonishing to me that this 7-million man army of prime-age guys has been allowed to be invisible," Eberstadt says. "I don't think decision-makers, pundits, prognosticators or people in power know anyone in the bottom half. They don't really know what's going on in their lives."    So how is it that a billionaire businessman from New York City has connected so deeply with the geographically isolated white working class?    "He flouts the norms of Washington and New York - he says, 'Conventional wisdom is bulls-t and we're not gonna play by those rules anymore,'" says Avent. "For a lot of people who've been treading water for 15, 20 years - that Trump's willing to address their concerns is a positive."    Vance agrees, and points to the media's misreading of Trump's "I love the uneducated" comment as a prime example.    Pundits and plutocrats, he says, interpreted that statement as condescending - stupid in and of itself.    The uneducated, Vance says, felt like a presidential candidate finally saw them. Not since Robert F. Kennedy, who famously traveled to Appalachia in 1968 to shine a light on America's poor, has a presidential candidate overtly addressed this shadow electorate.    "These people have felt very ignored by the political process for a long time," Vance says. "They think people don't care about them. Trump's identified all these members of the white working class. The sense I get from people back home isn't that they think he's going to fix [the economy]. They're just so relieved someone is speaking to them. The coal miner, the construction worker - they love him."    The coal miner and the construction worker: These are just two of the many, many jobs vanishing over decades. September's Bureau of Labor report clocked 4,000 jobs lost in mining and logging and 6,000 in construction in a one-month period.    Manufacturing jobs have been on the decline since 1979, with over 7 million lost in that sector to date. So when Trump issues broad statements on trade - "Our country is getting ripped off," "We can't continue to allow China to rape our country" - it's no surprise that a huge part of the electorate feels someone is simply and plainly standing up for them.   Trump, of course, has been widely corrected on his many vague and often incorrect pronouncements, but it's worth noting - as with his estimate of a 40 percent unemployment rate - that he occasionally hits the mark. And when he does, it's with the uneducated white worker. Writing in Bloomberg View back in January, Megan McArdle cited economists Tyler Cowen, David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson on the disastrous effects of opening our markets to China.    "It's been obvious for a while that China has played some role (though not the biggest) in the decline of labor-market opportunities for workers without a college diploma," McArdle wrote. "But the authors suggest that the effect is both bigger, and longer lasting, than I would have predicted. Nor has much seemed to help the adjustment: Workers are less mobile than expected, domestic American industries less able to absorb the surplus, particularly among the lower-skilled workers whose human capital was job- and industry-specific."    As our global economy continues to hurtle towards an automated world, what seemingly recession-proof jobs will disappear? Much has been made of our continued ability to adjust, with the "gig" economy - a far too cutesy name for a depressing, onerous reality - cited as a prime example.    The underemployed, we're told, can supplement their incomes as Uber drivers - until one day in the near future, when Uber goes driverless. (The company has been test-driving automated cars in Pittsburgh.)    Delivery people will be replaced by drones; accountants, salespeople, brokers, telemarketers, referees, fast-food workers, bartenders, chefs, housekeepers and surgeons by software and artificial intelligence.    In March, the White House reported that someone making less than $20 an hour has an 83 percent chance of losing their job to automation. Even the world's oldest profession isn't safe: Humans will be having sex with robots by 2050, according to recent projections.    "Because they would be programmable, sexbots would meet each individual user's needs," American Research Fellow Joel Snell told the Daily Star. "Robotic sex may become better than human sex." If everyone from the neurosurgeon to the sex worker is at risk for unemployment, this leads to the real question: Are we heading for a world without work? And in the immediate, are we looking at a permanent underclass here in the US, a substantial segment of the population that will never work again?    Vance and Avent both agree that we already have a long-term permanent underclass. "And we're not engaging with the underclass as they are," Vance says.    "Hillary's idea for free college education is a good impulse - but the reason a lot of kids don't go isn't because they can't afford it. It's because they're so screwed up, so behind the educational curve, that they can't handle it." Yet Vance acknowledges that among his class in particular - proud, independent, forceful - any social programs, any attempt by government to intervene, would be rejected. No matter who wins in November, "this is not a one-term presidential problem," Vance says. "These people are going to struggle and continue to be struggling. It's a permanent underclass of many ethnicities." Avent agrees.    "We need to start thinking about: How do we want to address these people, the permanent underclass falling out of the labor force, if they're only going to grow?" he says. Like many economists, Avent thinks American economic expansion after World War II was an aberration, the result of specific circumstances never to be repeated.    Eberstadt also sees a bleak future for the American worker. In his book, he cites the recent consensus among economists "redefining the growth potential of the US economy downward . . . Here, then, is the underlying contradiction of economic life in America's second Gilded Age: the steep drop in popular satisfaction with the direction of the country, the increasing attraction of extremist voices in electoral politics and why overwhelming majorities continue to tell public opinion pollsters, year after year, that our ever-richer America is still stuck in a recession." If the labor market continues to shrink, how does that affect us as a society? How do we avoid an underclass riven by boredom, depression, at even higher risk for addiction?    These are questions no politician will address openly - though Vance, in his book, recalls discussing this very problem with a close friend then working in George W. Bush's White House.    "The best way to look at this," the friend said, "might be to recognize that you probably can't fix these things. They'll always be around. But maybe you can put your thumb on the scale a little for the people at the margins."     That, of course, was before the crash of 2008. Today, the people once at the margins are becoming the majority.  
December 14, 2016	 The New York Post	  Iran warns it will destroy Israel and start World War III if Donald Trump tears up the nuclear deal. China calls him "as ignorant as a child" and threatens to end all cooperation if Trump doesn't recognize Taiwan as part of China.    Then there are the Hillary Clinton Democrats, who are trying to steal the election they lost. Some fellow Republicans also are breaking with the president-elect over Russian hacking allegations and his selection of oilman Rex Tillerson for secretary of state.     If you blinked, you missed the Trump honeymoon. He hasn't taken office, yet already, the long knives are out for him.     The conflicts could be Trump's baptism by fire, except he ran an endless gantlet of fire during the 18-month campaign. Numerous reports of his demise were not premature, they were flat-out wrong.     I suspect something similar is happening now. The whole world looks to be having a nervous breakdown over his early actions, and many Americans are wondering if the wheels are about to come off the Trump train. Some on the left, including those in the White House, certainly hope so and are doing all they can to delegitimize his victory and undermine democracy. If only they treated America's enemies so ruthlessly.     Still, the good news is that they hope and scheme in vain. Trump shows no signs of going wobbly, and while he doesn't always keep calm, he does carry on.     He has taken the most vicious pounding of any candidate in modern times, and still pulled off one of the great upsets in political history. Why would he buckle now?    As the late Mayor Ed Koch once said of himself: I give ulcers, I don't get them. So it is with Trump. He takes pleasure in driving his opponents crazy.    If he were the appeasing sort, he would back off now, say soothing things to make the hysterics feel better, and pledge to play nice.    Fortunately, that's not the man America elected. Trump is a master negotiator, and now that he has the attention of China, Iran and Democrats, he will try to use that as leverage to cut better deals for national security and working Americans.     But Trump is also a pure disrupter, the greatest threat to politics-as-usual ever to win the Oval Office. He may want to negotiate, or he may keep plowing ahead until he gets all that he wants.    The other party never knows which side of him they're getting. Is he looking to make a deal, or does he want it all?     His life story shows examples of both. The title of his first book is "The Art of the Deal," but one of the most striking statements in it is this: "My style of deal-making is quite simple and straightforward. I aim very high, and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I'm after."    That's why he won the election. Most of the voters in 30 states wanted change, and he was the clear change agent. But change of the magnitude they want and he seeks - wholesale change, at home and abroad - can't happen smoothly. Many eggs must be broken to rearrange the power structure.    The architects of the status quo, including the mainstream media, establishment leaders of both parties, as well as hostile powers such as China and Iran, have everything to lose from Trump's agenda. Most of his changes will come at their expense, so they can be expected to fight him all the way, as they are now.    That's fine, that's how the Founders devised the separation of powers, and that's the way the world works - everybody pursues their own interests.    Trump will not always prevail, or always be right. His election was an urgent course correction, but sometimes, the correction will need to be corrected. The key is for him to keep his bond with the American people by speaking directly to them, and listening to what they say in return.     Remember, too, we are in the early stages of the battle for America's renewal. Whatever you do, don't be a spectator. And always be prepared to be surprised.  
August 9, 2016	 The New York Post	  Donald Trump called Monday for a "tax revolution" modeled on the vision of Ronald Reagan that would slash income-tax rates, cut corporate taxes, and create millions of jobs for a new era of prosperity.    "These reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan tax reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation," the GOP presidential nominee told the Detroit Economic Club.    In an hour-long address that also called for toughening trade policies and easing regulatory directives, Trump proposed to simplify the tax code to just three brackets from the current seven - 12, 25 and 33 percent.    "I am proposing an across-the-board income-tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans," Trump proclaimed, although the highest wage earners would see their rate fall from 39.6 percent to 33 percent.    "The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs or undermines our ability as a nation to compete."    The mogul also called for capping corporate taxes at 15 percent, down from the current 35 percent rate, a move long advocated by Republicans.     And he repeated common campaign themes of scrapping ObamaCare, renegotiating NAFTA, and rejecting the Trans-Pacific Partnership to stop the flow of US jobs overseas.    The speech also included a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations and revival of the Keystone pipeline project, which was killed by President Obama.    "President Obama has issued close to 400 new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more," Trump charged.    The Detroit remarks were Trump's first on the economy since he announced a 13-man team of economic advisers last week, but he also said he consulted with his daughter Ivanka on how to make child care less expensive.   Trump advocated allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxable income.     The current Child and Dependent Care tax credit is capped at 35 percent of qualifying expenses, or up to $3,000 for one child or $6,000 for two or more.    "No family will have to pay the death tax. American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death. It's just plain wrong," Trump said.    Hedge-funders would take it on the chin, as Trump vowed to end the "carried interest loophole," which allows them to pay the lower capital-gains tax rate instead of the regular income-tax rate.    Moving from taxes, Trump proposed stronger protections for American intellectual property, pointedly accusing China of being the worst offender.   Trump repeatedly used Detroit as an example of how Democratic policies - supported by his opponent, Hillary Clinton - have devastated American manufacturing.    "The city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda. Every policy that has failed this city and so many others is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton," he said.    "She supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community . . . and the immigration policies that have strained local budgets and the trade deals like NAFTA . . . that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries," he charged.    The speech came after Trump got tangled up in a week-long dispute with the Gold Star parents of a Muslim-American soldier who was killed in the Iraq and sparred with GOP leaders including House speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Sen. John McCain.    Stephen Moore, one of Trump's top economic advisers, said the expansive proposals should put those episodes to rest.    "When he speaks with the teleprompter and stays on message, he's very effective . . . I was highly impressed. Hopefully, it's the start of a new Donald Trump," Moore told The Post.    "Trickle-down economics does not help our economy grow, it does not help the vast majority of Americans, but it does really help the most wealthy. We're going to make the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes for a change," Clinton said.  
December 8, 2016	 The New York Post	  President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to cut off funding for "sanctuary cities" (including New York) that resist his call to help the feds' deport violent criminals who are in the country illegally. And despite critics' claims this would be unconstitutional, two legal scholars assert it would "almost certainly pass muster at the Supreme Court." In the Los Angeles Times, David Rivkin and Elizabeth Price Foley write that while Washington can't force states and cities to carry out federal law - i.e., actual deportations - they can be made to disclose information. Which means "Congress can require state, local or university police to tell federal agents when they arrest an immigrant present in the country illegally." So "withholding funds from cities and universities that provide sanctuary" for such criminals is constitutional.    If media silence is the judge, then former UN Ambassador John Bolton "looks like the front-runner for secretary of state," writes Eli Lake at Bloomberg. Yes, he has "some liabilities," including "too close" ties with "the nuttier fringes of the anti-Sharia movement." But there are "strong reasons" why "he would be a good fit" with Trump, including his "significant experience navigating the State Department." He's also been "a successful diplomat" with proven accomplishments and "takes a hard line with rogue states." In "temperament and ideology," he is John Kerry's opposite - and "it's worth asking what the Kerry approach has gotten us."    Jobn Tkacik, a retired Foreign Service officer who served in both Taipei and Beijing, says he is "pleasantly amused by the media kerfuffle" over Trump's phone call with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-Wen. Writing at The National Interest, he recalls a similar brouhaha in 1980 when then-candidate Ronald Reagan called for re-establishing "official relations" with Taipei. Yet few realize that the United States "does not recognize, and never has, a 'One China' of which Taiwan is part." What Washington acknowledges is "China's position" that Taiwan is part of China, but the US "has not itself agreed to this position." Trump's phone call is a "fresh breeze" that clears the air of "misinformation that has enveloped Washington's China policy for the last quarter century" - and which "hasn't been working out too well for us."    Defense Secretary Ash Carter is making a mistake when he says repeatedly that "today's American military is the best the world has ever seen." Col. (ret.) Gary Anderson, writing in Foreign Policy, says such "chest-beating breeds complacency." Fact is, "in the absence of real mobilization exercises and readiness war games, we simply have no way of quantifying our capability to wage war in either Europe or Asia in the near term." Anderson says today's officers tell him "horror stories" about a "lack of lack of training opportunities and flight hours." And many "fear disciplining people of other genders and races, believing they will be accused of racism or sexual harassment." The next administration, he warns, can't fix something until it knows "how broken it is."    Ben Carson's selection as Housing and Urban Development secretary "provides the chance to rethink a great deal of what the 1960s-era agency has done," says Howard Husock says at National Review. He suggests Carson "push for outright repeal of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which mandates bank lending to low-income communities and low-income households" and was implicated " the 2008 housing-finance crisis." In the age of Quicken Loans and other online services, local banks are no longer the last word in mortgages, he notes. Yet they're still "under pressure from regulators to make loans to low-income borrowers, regardless of whether they are repaid." Says Husock: "Guaranteeing mortgages to any and all comers only causes problems down the line."   
December 7, 2016	 The New York Post	  Chinese propaganda blasted President-elect Donald Trump Tuesday as a "diplomatic rookie" and warned that he should shut up.      The scathing reports came days after Trump took a congratulatory phone call from the president of Taiwan, a breach of diplomatic norms that upset leaders of the communist power.     "Provoking friction and messing up China-US relations won't help 'make America great again,' " said a front-page opinion article in the People's Daily, a Communist Party vessel.     Likewise, warnings of Trump's "inability to keep his mouth shut" and his "provocation and falsehoods" were the subject of a front-page article in the Chinese edition of the Global Times.    And the English version of the China Daily earned that Trump could create "costly troubles for his country," calling the soon-to-be president a "diplomatic rookie."    "As president-elect, Trump can expect some forgiveness even when he is shooting from the hip. But things will be different when he becomes president," the China Daily opined.  
December 8, 2016	 The New York Post	  If a congratulatory phone call from the president of Taiwan can upset the balance of US-China relations, I think it's time we rethink and reset the components of that relationship ("Phone-y outrage" Dec. 5).  Ted Zeller Oldwick, NJ     After President Obama held hands with Vladimir Putin and Secretary of State John Kerry cuddled up to Iran, what's so terrible about Donald Trump taking a congratulatory call from a true friend of America, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen?    Obama's State Department would have us believe that the Republic of China - Taiwan - is part of the People's Republic of China, and that Jerusalem isn't a part of Israel.     Denial of reality isn't wise policy. Pretending that we don't recognize Taiwan makes us look foolish and fearful of the truth.    Trump's call with the Taiwanese president allows us to be honest with ourselves and with the world. It's a welcome change - and long overdue.  Joseph Koenig Manhattan    Since when can a country tell our president-elect who he can talk to? Maybe in the Obama administration, but not in Trump's. 
January 20, 2017	 The New York Post	  It arrived under a cascade of 10,000 balloons in a delirious blaze of 1980s optimism. Donald Trump's pink-marble fantasy, home to the world's most glamorous boutiques, wrapped in gleaming, dark-bronze glass, opened on Fifth Avenue when empty store windows and "Going Out of Business" signs abounded.    For a few golden years after its opening on Feb. 14, 1983, Trump Tower audaciously screamed that New York, beset by soaring crime and crumbling streets, might once again live up to its self-proclaimed "world's greatest city" image.    Sightseers oohed over the seven-story-high lobby waterfall. Wide-eyed fashionistas flocked to stores like Cartier and Buccellati, which ringed five atrium levels like diamond tiaras. Johnny Carson, Steven Spielberg and Sophia Loren bought apartments upstairs priced up to $12 million.     The AIA Guide to New York City proclaimed Trump's "fantasyland for the affluent shopper" as "flamboyant, exciting and emblematic of the American dream."   Trump's dream soon turned to laughs. It was ridiculed by architectural critics and abandoned by celebrity residents who sold their pads to swindlers and felons. Stores and boutiques bailed out, too, leaving cheaper stores and empty space in their wake.    Now the last laugh belongs to Trump's flagship tower. Thirty-four years later, the 68-story skyscraper can claim all the clout any bricks-and-mortar could want.    "We call it the Black House," a waiter at the Armani restaurant across the street said of what's now the most important address in the world. The question now is whether President Donald J. Trump can tear himself away from his beloved penthouse in the sky at 725 Fifth Ave. and downsize into the White House.    Although Der Scutt is Trump Tower's architect of record, it was as much the vision of Donald Trump himself. It promised better times ahead - for the reeling city and for Trump, who quickly sold $300 million worth of condos, a previously unheard-of feat that enabled him to pay off the building's mortgage and construction cost.   Trump and his then-lovebird wife, Ivana, made their nest in a $100 million "Versailles in the sky" triplex designed by Angelo Donghia in Louis XIV style. Its over-the-top, marble and 24-karat gold surfaces mocked the rococo imitations of Maxwell's Plum, the Upper East Side eatery where the couple first met. Trump called the apartment's creation "harder than building the building itself."    But a less triumphant tale soon unfolded downstairs. New York Times architectural critic Ada Louise Huxtable, who had written nice things about the tower when it was in the planning stage, demanded Trump remove an old, favorable quotation of hers from the lobby's "pink-marble maelstrom."    Shoppers began to pass up exotic stores such as Ludwig Beck, a Bavarian purveyor of Germanic products like forest-green jackets with buttons in the shape of horns. Of 40-odd stores that opened in Trump Tower in 1983, nearly 20 percent moved out by 1986.    In December 1987, Trump threw a monster bash in the atrium for the book Tony Schwartz wrote for him, "The Art of the Deal." Trump's pal Jackie Mason hosted what was billed as "the party of the year." New Yorker writer Jane Mayer recently described how "a thousand guests in black tie were served champagne and fed slices of a giant cake replica of Trump Tower . . . wheeled in by a parade of women waving red sparklers."    But the evening did no favors to the tower's image. Many of us who attended recall a scary, goal-line pileup of black-tied bodies at the feet of overcrowded escalators. Few got cake: Everyone else fought over morsels of bad snack food.    Once the early retail euphoria wore off, cheaper jewelry and tchotchke shops drew a tackier crowd. "If I'm buying a $2,500 suede outfit, I don't want to be surrounded by 25 percent of the adult population of Boise, Idaho," one said in 1985.   Trump struggled with the atrium for nearly 20 years. He turned the third and fourth floors into showrooms. Competitors took notice. Related Cos. CEO Stephen Ross told The Post in 1999 that the mega-mall he was building at Columbus Circle, part of what's now Time Warner Center, would "make Trump Tower look like a postage stamp."    When Avon installed a ritzy spa on the fifth and sixth floors, Trump boasted to The Post: "I used to get 22 small checks, a lot of work. Now I get one check from a triple-A company." But his triple-A tenant was gone by 2006. Britain's Asprey launched a triplex emporium in 2003, but it, too, closed after just three years. Tourists hoping to catch a glimpse of Trump en route to his TV show, "The Apprentice," found a gaping hole for rent at street level.   Trump finally hit the jackpot when Gucci moved its flagship there in 2008. But shoppers can enter the store only from the sidewalk, not through the tourist-clogged atrium home only to Trump's Grill and Bar. Trump boasts in a promotional video that the bar is a hotbed for romance. Why? "The pink marble makes people look better . . . people feel they look better in the pink marble."    Life in Trump Tower condos could be sweet. A British-born friend of mine who lived in a high-floor apartment in the 1990s loved "watching the blimps sail by." She and her boyfriend filled the house with more stuffed animals than at FAO Schwarz.    But mundane, law-abiding domestic bliss wasn't for everyone. Among scoundrels who replaced the celebrity first wave of buyers were helicopter mogul Joseph Weichselbaum, whose choppers once ferried passengers to Trump's Atlantic City casinos. Weichselbaum, a convicted embezzler and drug trafficker, moved into a girlfriend's apartment in the tower in 1999, after he had done prison time.    Hard-partying art dealer Helly Nahmad - a current resident who "devotes most of his time buying Renoirs and Modiglianis to stockpile," the Observer reported - spent time behind bars in 2014 for his role in a $100 million gambling ring. The games in his 51st-floor Trump Tower apartments drew Leonardo DiCaprio and Alex Rodriguez. Nahmad returned to his aerie in 2015. He remained there under house arrest for a few months after being transferred from a halfway house in The Bronx.    The scene is as mixed in Trump Tower's 200,000 square feet of office space on floors 14 to 26. They're home to the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which China-bashing Trump once called "a great" tenant. On the creepier side was Steven Hoffenberg, a chest-thumping Ponzi schemer who briefly gained control of The Post when former owner Peter Kalikow ran out of dough in early 1993.    A few weeks after Hoffenberg was blessedly ousted from his perch as Post "publisher," he announced plans to launch his own daily paper out of a Trump Tower suite.    Hoffenberg told Bloomberg that for Trump, "Renting space has nothing do with color or race - or indictment. It has to do with if you can pay the rent."     Hoffenberg soon moved to a less forgiving address, the federal prison in Fort Dix, NJ, where he spent the next 18 years.    Many Americans know Trump Tower mainly from NBC's "The Apprentice." Producer Mark Burnett sold a hesitant Trump on the idea partly by telling him that shooting his scenes entirely inside the tower wouldn't take up much of his precious time.    The wood-paneled "boardroom" that spawned Trump's "You're fired!" line is actually a set. The hocus-pocus drew over 20 million viewers in its first season and made Trump a familiar, popular face in American homes for 12 years. Two years before Twitter was born in 2006, Trump used his "Apprentice" pulpit to refine his words into the needle-sharp instrument of praise or pain that later would define his campaign.   Trump, accompanied by Melania, rode the grand escalator to Trump Tower's ground floor to announce his presidential candidacy in June 2015. New Yorkers who barely tolerated the tower they regarded as a tacky monument to Trump's ego now have reason to hate it outright.    What was merely a public circus prior to Trump's election - remember last summer's suction-cup wall climber? - mushroomed into blocked streets and sidewalks that paralyzed Midtown and ruined business at Tiffany and Armani. Tower residents who paid millions for their homes must brave the Secret Service, the NYPD and howling protesters.    But the chaos doesn't faze visitors from the rest of the country. Their selfie-snapping numbers seem greater than ever. They seem to enjoy the chaos and a "Naked Trump" hunk who shares the Fifth Avenue sidewalk with machine-gun-toting security guards.    The tourists' pilgrimages to Trump Tower matter more than those of world leaders and captains of industry who cross the marble floor to kiss the commander in chief's ring. They are, after all, the between-the-coasts Americans who elected Trump. It's their tower, too - even if it never likely crossed Donald Trump's mind that he'd one day have to share it with them.  
June 5, 2016	 The New York Post	  Are President Obama, Hillary Clinton and violent leftists in cahoots to elect Donald Trump? Or are they just idiots?    The evidence is overwhelming that they all belong to a conspiracy - either of secret GOP sympathizers or of dunces. Those are the only options after Democrats took turns denouncing Trump in ways that actually bolstered the potency of his arguments. Three examples tell the tale.    First, Obama traveled to Indiana to deliver what aides called his first attempt to influence the election. That's a lie, of course, but not the biggest one of the day. No. 1 would be Obama's touting the economy as a roaring success.     "If what you care about in this election is your pocketbook; if what you're concerned about is who will look out for the interests of working people and grow the middle class," the president claimed, "if what you're concerned about is the economy, then the debate is not even close."    He crowed about "progress" made during his tenure, and said sticking with Democrats was the only sensible option.     Two days later, the Labor Department reported that employers added a mere 38,000 jobs in May, the worst report in six years. Even with massive help from the Federal Reserve, the economy's slow growth means it has created three million fewer jobs than it should have by now, making Obama's boast look ridiculous.    It also makes Trump's focus on creating jobs and criticism of ­international trade deals look like the right ideas. After all, if puny growth for seven years is the best Obama can do, why not give the other team and other ideas a chance?    Clinton provided the second backfire example with her ­foreign-policy speech. It had very little to do with actual foreign policy, and everything to do with a rehearsed rant on Trump. She called him reckless, childish, uninformed and unprepared.    The liberal press ate it up, displaying a remarkable talent for ignoring the foreign-policy ­disasters unfolding around the world, courtesy of Clinton and Obama. The next president will inherit the brutal aggressions of China and Russia and the cancerous spread of Islamic terrorism.     And it takes a special media willfulness to refuse to see the biblical deprivations befalling millions of refugees spilling out from Syria and Libya after Obama and Clinton helped turn those countries' crises into ­catastrophes. In a recent span of just eight days, about 1,000 people drowned trying to escape across the Mediterranean to ­Europe.    The third evidence of a conspiracy involved a Trump rally in San Jose, Calif. Or rather, it ­involved the thugs, gang members and people burning the American flag and waving Mexican flags who attacked Trump supporters.     An ABC reporter tweeted that police lost control and that "Trump supporters [were] being terrorized and beaten up by mobs of protesters." Among those beaten was a man named Juan Hernandez, a gay Latino Trump supporter who released photos of his broken nose and bloody shirt, along with a statement, writing:     "Got jumped last night as we exited the rally . . . Thanks for a broken nose, uncontrollable bleeding, and a bash to the head, Democrats. You sure are doing your party proud."    As Hernandez notes, the violence helps make Trump's case. If the candidate's promise to control the border brings such a ferocious backlash, he's on to something.     That scary thought must have seeped into the central brain of The New York Times, which gave a disgracefully distorted picture of what happened in San Jose. It called the one-way ­assaults "clashes" between "protesters" and Trump backers, as if both sides were equally to blame.     Even more shameful, the paper's Friday article included this sentence: "While Mr. Trump has said he does not condone violence of any kind, his campaign made little effort to condemn it."    The pattern is obvious - the Democrats' Way is in trouble. The economy won't cooperate with their big-government nostrums, Clinton is dodging Bernie Sanders and the FBI, and Obama doesn't understand why the world doesn't treat his every ­utterance as gospel. 
July 29, 2016	 The New York Post	  Why are the Democrats getting so worked up over Donald Trump's remarks about Russia hacking Clinton's "lost" e-mails ("Kerfuffle Over Czar Wars," July 28)?     One would think that Clinton would want them discovered in order to prove she sent 30,000 e-mails about yoga classes and her daughter's wedding.     It's beyond comprehension how anybody can believe that if the Democratic National Committees e-mails were hacked, Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server wasn't hacked, too.     There's little question in anybody's mind that Russia, China and other adversaries had access to top-secret information because of this.   Trump was actually throwing digs at the liberal media standing in front of him. All he did was sarcastically suggest that he'd be happy if the missing e-mails turned up. That's the last thing the Clintons or the media want.     How could Russia even break into a server that doesn't even exist anymore to steal deleted e-mails?     If Mike Pence has any integrity, he'll resign as Trump's running mate so Trump can pick Vladimir Putin instead.    I had a good laugh after the Russian hackers released thousands of the DNC's anti-Bernie Sanders e-mails. This gave DNC officials a black eye.    Trump took heat when he jokingly invited the Russians to release the thousands of e-mails Hillary erased.    The chilling thought is that if the Russians do so, it proves that many foreign governments have the ability to get information, secret or not, and use it against our country.      Melania Trump's supposed plagiarism was a non-story, and so is Trump asking Russia to find Hillary's missing e-mails.     Believe me, I'd estimate 80 percent of Americans would like to see those deleted e-mails as well.    How could it be "encouraging espionage" or a "national security issue" if the 30,000 deleted e-mails were only about Clinton's personal business like yoga classes, Chelsea Clinton's wedding and her mother's funeral?     The spin is on: Instead of going after outgoing DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other Democratic head honchos, the media has stepped in for Hillary's campaign to divert attention away from the DNC and blamed the Russians.    The fact that newspapers felt the need to blame Trump in connection with the hacking of the DNC, but not scold the DNC for a biased nomination process rigged against Bernie the entire time, proves that they're completely irrelevant.    If Hillary's e-mails are released and show she took money as bribes, who are the papers going to blame?  
December 8, 2016	 The New York Post	  OK, maybe it's not so funny. The Chinese certainly wouldn't think it is - but I chuckled when I recently realized what I had innocently gotten myself in the middle of.    Here it is: A couple of months ago, I suggested that Taiwan contact then-candidate Donald Trump to say hello. In fact, it was when everyone else in the media world was predicting - without a doubt in their minds - that Hillary Clinton would run away with the election.      As you know - and if you don't, I'm happy to tell you again - I'm the only journalist in America who thought that Trump not only had a chance to win but also that he would win. I wrote that in many columns.    I'm also the guy who went out on the thinnest of limbs and said Trump would be a formidable competitor when he announced his candidacy in 2015. While late-night TV hosts were busy making fun of him, I was taking him seriously.    Back in mid-September, the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) was holding the Taiwan Excellence Product Showcase 2016 Media Luncheon in Manhattan. (The group obviously is not very good at coming up with catchy names, but I didn't hold it against them.)     Anyway, that country was showing off its products and had invited a bunch of journalists to attend the showcase at the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle as well as the lunch at a hotel on Central Park South.    I couldn't attend, didn't want to or - unlikely - wasn't hungry that day. I probably thought it was one of those long, drawn-out lunches and I didn't have the time. So, instead, I suggested a meeting with one of the country's representatives.    The group was amenable. So, right before the lunch was to take place, I met with Francis Kuo-Hsin Liang, the chairman of TAITRA, at his suite in the JW Marriott Essex House. It was the two of us sitting across from each other at a small table, with his entourage of about a half dozen people backed against the walls and not saying a thing even when I addressed them.     Liang and I talked about this and that. Taiwan's products. The country's trade positions. The film industry - which I had just read Taiwan was interested in, and so on. Liang and I were getting along well.    That's when I told him that Trump was going to win the election. He didn't chuckle. In fact, he didn't seem to have much of a reaction - it was as if I had told him it was going to rain.     I asked what he thought about that possibility. Liang said Trump's election would make his country worry about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact that Asian countries were - and still are - hoping the US would join.    That's when I suggested to Liang that his country get in touch with Trump. I said I knew Trump and he was a nice, reasonable guy and that's what his country should do. In other words, why not put a call in?    It was just another meeting - tucked back in my wrinkled day-planner - until the Taiwan situation exploded into the headlines last week.    Trump claims that the Taiwanese called to congratulate him on his election. News organizations, including the Washington Post, claim that Trump was purposely trying to provoke the Chinese by either contacting a representative of the Taiwanese government or by accepting a call.    You see, the Chinese don't get along with Taiwan. In fact, our "One China" policy - whereby the US only officially recognizes mainland China - has been in place for decades.    So, my suggestion - like Trump taking that call - was a major political faux pas. I honestly don't know whether my little, off-hand remark had anything to do with what later happened. But I did contact Liang's representative after the election to remind him that "I told him so."    For the record, I'm not in favor of antagonizing the Chinese, even if the president-elect might be. The Chinese have been very nice to us when it comes to buying our debt - even if lately they've mostly been selling it. So why bite the hand that . . .     Let me also say for posterity that I'm sorry if I caused Liang or anyone else in Taiwan or Washington to break with longstanding protocol. I wasn't trying to shake the swamp - although I think the correct way to say that would be "stir up the swamp."    But I'm still going to have lunch with Liang when he's back in town. Francis, call me. I have some more ideas that'll get us into trouble.     With that thought, President-elect Trump is keeping his promise to shake things up in Washington.     Of all the things he could have done to make people believe there would be no business-as-usual, this was the one thing he shouldn't have done.    Steven Mnuchin, who I never met and I don't think many people have ever heard of, will undoubtedly continue the tradition of Wall Street dictating financial policies in DC. 
August 8, 2016	 The New York Post	  Embracing the presidential aspirations of Donald Trump was, from the start, an exercise in magical thinking. In my heart, I wanted the smack-talking, hair-challenged, self-absorbed New York City billionaire Republican to nail down this baby.    I've hung out with Trump, 70, many times over the years, professionally, socially and in wacky combinations of the two. I interviewed him inside a stretch limo in New Hampshire in 2011 about his White House ambitions. But the chat devolved into a madcap dash through Podunk streets too small for his ride - or his ego. Trump soon got palpably bored with the Granite State and the presidency, and started motor-mouthing about "Celebrity Apprentice'' and his suspicion, which was proven wrong, that President Obama was born in Kenya. He asked the driver to drop him off at his private chopper emblazoned with the name "TRUMP'' for the trip home.    "Want a ride in my helicopter?'' he asked me. Not wanting to find myself airborne over the Throgs Neck Bridge with no exit strategy, I begged off.    Here is a guy with the common touch, but the attention span of a flea. He's someone voters would enjoy having a beer with, even though he doesn't drink alcohol. Can you imagine the torture of sharing a Bud Light with Democrat Hillary Clinton?    I think Trump secretly doesn't want the prize. Why would he crave spending endless hours in policy meetings, cavorting with miserable domestic and world leaders and abandoning his collection of obscenely opulent abodes to live in public housing at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. in Washington, DC?    His penthouse, which sprawls over the 66th, 67th and 68th floors of Trump Tower, looks like the palace of Louis XIV - if the French king mated with Liberace, with 24-karat-gold accents adorning everything from the lamps to the china, marble bathtubs and a vaulted living-room ceiling painted with a fresco of scantily clad babes.     When I visited about two months after his lovely wife, Melania, now 46, gave birth to the couple's son, Barron, now 10, the infamous germophobe boasted that after fathering five children, he'd never changed a diaper.    I enthused that Melania, who stood quietly nearby aboard 5-inch stilettos, had lost all her baby weight. Trump corrected me: "She's almost lost all the baby weight.''     I was embarrassed for the mother of his youngest kid, who ignored the dig. Trump staffers asked a photographer and me to put sterile cotton booties over our shoes so as not to sully the carpet. It was time to get the hell out of the loony bin.    My all-time favorite Hollywood GOP curmudgeon, Clint Eastwood, 86, told Esquire magazine in the September issue that we're living in a "pussy generation'' beholden to political correctness. Trump, he said, is "onto something.'' But he stopped short of endorsing him.   Trump picked a stupid fight with the Muslim Gold Star parents of 27-year-old Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq in 2004. Sure, dad Khizr Khan put the candidate on the spot while at the Democratic National Convention. Holding up a copy of the US Constitution, he needled Trump - "Have you even read the Constitution?''    Instead, he said the dad had "no right'' to "viciously'' criticize him, and accused the slain soldier's mom, Ghazala Khan, of standing by silently as her husband spoke because she is Muslim. (She later said she was too distraught to speak.)    I can no longer justify calling myself a Trumpkin. I'm done with The Donald. Let's grab a beer - or I will - and call it quits. 
December 12, 2016	 The New York Post	  Donald Trump is going to be our next President. Is the sky falling yet? To find out, we decided we'd leave our Chicken Little costumes hanging in the closet, for a short while at least, and instead poke our heads into a few of the nation's most sage political rags, both right and left. In the process, of course, we found ourselves dodging more than a few shards of the firmament.     On the conservative side, Weekly Standard editor William Kristol had been branded not only a "loser" but also a "dummy" by our president-elect, as the pair locked horns on everything from the Iraq War to immigration. So what does Kristol - who, in turn, had called Trump a "con man," a "charlatan and a demagogue" and "dead to me" - have to say now? Well, very little, apart from advising readers to "Keep your panic dry" before excerpting a rather lengthy quote from George Washington which pleads to God "to pardon our national and other transgressions." This, we would submit, reads like the journalistic equivalent of curling into the fetal position.     National Review, which also had turned up its nose at The Donald, offers a mostly sobered-up collection of essays on the election results. "Republican voters were not quite who the party thought they were," writes Yuval Levin, as if the magazine itself had known all along. "Reduce deficits and don't forget about the workers," advises Edward Conrad, outlining what he calls "a new trade consensus" with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight. Elsewhere, columnist Reihan Salam predicts that Trump "might try to expand his support with a centrist health-insurance proposal" - a "bipartisan ObamaCare deal" that he appears to be strikingly OK with.     Funny how the Nation seems far less optimistic about any such deal. Robert Borosage's bald assertion that Trump will follow through on a pledge to "repeal and replace" ObamaCare is about as substantive a discussion as we got in the current issue. Indeed, the editors seem far more concerned about a Wall Street giveaway and an environmental apocalypse. That said, the quotes that rang most true were contained in John Nichols' urge that "We must transform the Democratic Party," which slaps the Clintons for "sleeping with Wall Street" while imagining that "wage-starved workers ... wouldn't notice."    The Atlantic, whose December issue appears to have been to bed before the early-morning election results of Nov. 9, nevertheless has a strong piece by James Fallows on the subject of China. Fallows observes, "It has become repressive in a way that it has not been since the Cultural Revolution." This, we would suggest, is something that Hillary Clinton's glad-handing husband helped lay the track for in the 1990s, as he freed up trade while asking for little in return. In this respect, among others, we can be glad he won't be in the White House again.    New York political columnist Jonathan Chait tries to argue that Trump campaigned as a Marxist, but that what voters are likely to end up with is something closer to ... well, some kind of "authoritarian brand of populism." Trump's campaign "placed more emphasis on wages and work, and on cultural-populist themes, than Mitt Romney's did," Chait writes, eliding the rather glaring truth that Trump also outdid Hillary in this regard. "Equating Trump with the interests of the workers is a propaganda device meant to legitimize his power," Chait continues, as if lecturing to a freshman seminar at Bard College. "Representing the 'workers of the world' solves the problem." Why do we get the feeling that, if it were Vladimir Lenin he were quoting, Chait would be A-OK with the program?    In this week's Talk of the Town, the New Yorker's Margaret Talbot summons a dystopian vision of women's health under the Trump administration, with Planned Parenthood defunded, Obamacare dismantled and abortion clinics nationwide getting bombed with impunity as Attorney General-nominee Jeff Sessions averts his gaze. "To be fair, Trump has suggested one decent policy for women and families: a six-week paid maternity leave, which would indeed end a national disgrace," Talbot admits about halfway through the nightmare scenario. "But the plan pointedly omits paternity leave," she quickly adds, complaining that this would enshrine "an old-fashioned view of families." Margaret, we've got to hand it to you for explaining how maternity leave is a sinister plan that would oppress women.    Time grabbed headlines last week as it christened Trump its Person of the Year - and grabbed a second set of headlines when Trump chafed at its declaration he will be President of the Divided States of America. "It's hard to measure the scale of the disruption," writes Managing Editor Nancy Gibbs, still sounding shell-shocked by the election results after running a couple of covers beforehand that had heralded Trump's "meltdown." This week, the chastened editors run a lengthy feature on Trump supporters. "When Trump talked about getting rid of all the free-trade stuff, he brought to life the way this country should be going," said Thomas McTague of Plymouth, Pa. Read it and weep, Hillary.  
December 8, 2016	 The New York Post	  WASHINGTON - President-elect Donald Trump plans to nominate retired Gen. John Kelly to take over the Department of Homeland Security, putting three generals in place to take high-powered civilian posts in the new administration.      If confirmed by the Senate, Kelly would be in charge of the agency tasked with securing borders against illegal immigration, protecting the president, responding to natural disasters, and counterterrorism.    Like Trump, Kelly is believed to hold strong views on stopping illegal immigration. The four-star general told a congressional committee last year that the lack of security on the US-Mexico border represents a national security threat.    He is the most senior member of the military to have lost offspring in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Kelly, 66, left the military earlier this year. An official announcement is expected next week.     Other former generals selected by Trump are retired Gen. Jim Mattis, to head the Defense Department, and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, to serve as national security adviser.     Branstad received the job offer directly from the president-elect Tuesday at a Trump Tower meeting, aides said.    Branstad faces a delicate task because Trump has already ruffled diplomatic feathers by taking a phone call from the president of Taiwan, which China considers to be its territory.    McMahon, the former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment and wife of WWE mogul Vince McMahon, ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate from Connecticut in 2010 and 2012.    Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt will take charge of the Environmental Protection Agency, a source told The Post.    Pruitt, who was elected in the 2010 Tea Party wave, has filed lawsuits targeting the EPA and the environmental policies of the Obama administration.    "The left is going to hate him in the EPA. They definitely don't want Pruitt, a rule-of-law guy who relishes a fight," said a source close to Pruitt. The source added Pruitt's not going to wreck the agency, saying, "He wants to mend it, not end it."   With Reuters 
January 6, 2017	 The New York Post	  President-elect Donald Trump's public pressure on Detroit to keep auto manufacturing jobs in the US may soon include a related industry - auto part retailers, The Post has learned.     Stores including Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone and O'Reilly Auto Parts operate on fat margins created by importing a large percentage of their inventory from low-cost countries, insiders said.    If fully implemented, the border tax reform plan would prevent companies from subtracting from their gross profit the cost of goods made overseas and sold in the US, a source close to the Trump transition team said.     "It is a pretty significant change to the code," said Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation.    Pomerleau estimates that such a border tax change could raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years - even if corporate tax rates are lowered to 20 percent.     Proponents of a border tax believe it will encourage companies to make more products domestically.    While such a tax move will affect all companies that import goods, it could impact the shares of auto parts retailers disproportionately because Wall Street, perhaps blind to the possible ramifications of Trump's border tax reforms, have pushed shares of the auto part chains up sharply since Election Day.    One Wall Street analyst said the stock runup - Advance Auto Parts is up 25 percent since Nov. 8 - was the result of the expectation that the chains, which typically pay a 30 percent-plus tax rate, would pay lower taxes under Trump.    "We are trying to figure out how much of our product is imported," a source at one of the auto parts retailers said, referring to the potential impact of a border tax.    Auto part retailers have been increasing their margins in recent years by promoting their private-label brands, typically sourced from China and other low-cost countries.    AutoZone, for example, imports roughly 70 percent of its parts, a top car industry executive told The Post, requesting confidentiality.    The executive said he expected investors to take note of the change - and how it will affect the companies' profits - very soon.    "I bet the question will get asked [of the retailers] this quarter during conference calls with Wall Street," one analyst, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told The Post.    Last year, the US imported $25 billion in auto parts from China and exported only $2.5 billion, and most of the imbalance came from aftermarket suppliers including retailers, the executive said.    Detroit's original equipment suppliers are not expected to be hit as hard by any import tax law changes.    A change in the import tax law would be softened, proponents said, by a reduction in the corporate tax rate.    O'Reilly declined comment, and Advance Auto did not return calls. Trump's spokesperson declined comment. 
December 1, 2016	 The New York Post	  President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday picked Wilbur Ross to become the US Commerce secretary - but the Chinese government is a big investor in the private equity mogul's funds, The Post has learned.     WL Ross & Co. in 2010 raised about $500 million from a state enterprise, China Investment Corp., to invest alongside his fund, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation said.    The main job of the Commerce boss is to set and enforce trade policy, and candidate Trump was particularly critical of current policy in regard to trade relations with Beijing and promised to introduce tougher laws.     Ross told The Post on Wednesday if Trump believes there is a conflict of interest from any of his investments he would divest them. He declined to comment on whether CIC is in an investor in his firm. 
May 16, 2016	 The New York Post	  Long Island Rep. Peter King wants to break up the "romance" between Donald Trump and his Russian man-crush Vladimir Putin.     King, a Trump backer, said Sunday he still has "real questions" about the presumptive GOP presidential nominee's foreign-policy chops and begged the mogul to quit his infatuation with the Russian leader - telling CBS's "Face the Nation" that he's "very concerned about this romance he seems to have with Putin."     "And as far as his statement that he wants Russia to take care of what is happening in Syria, that's Barack Obama's policy," King added. "But, again, there's a lot about Donald Trump I like. He's brought people into the Republican Party. He's brought in the blue-collar Reagan Democrats, which we had lost over the years."    "I'm supporting him as the nominee of the party, but I still have real questions with him as far as national security," the Republican congressman said.     "I don't think his Asian policy is coherent, because, again, if he does want to get in a trade war with China, he has to explain how that coincides with him wanting to use China against North Korea. If he wants to have leverage over China, how can he be talking about taking troops out of Japan and Korea?"    Another congressional Trump backer, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), said Trump will be prone to awkward moments on the trail because "more than most candidates, he's a work in progress."     "Usually you know a lot more about a candidate because they've run for other things," Cole told ABC's "This Week."      "He does have a shoot-from-the-hip style," Cole said. "He's already said things he ought to regret and I think he will regret politically."  
May 2, 2016	 The New York Post	  WASHINGTON - Ted Cruz's Indiana strategy is hardly looking like a rousing "Hoosiers" story, with polls on Sunday showing a slam-dunk for Donald Trump in the state's Tuesday primary.     The billionaire is enjoying his biggest lead yet in the Hoosier State, with support from 49 percent of likely Republican primary voters compared with Cruz's 34 percent and John Kasich's 13 percent, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll found.    "It's over," he told "Fox News Sunday." "I think it's over now. But it's over. Cruz cannot win . . . He's got no highway."    Cruz and Kasich had teamed up to stop Trump, with the Texas senator campaigning alone in Indiana, while leaving New Mexico and Oregon to the Ohio governor.    Sunday's poll showed 58 percent of likely GOP voters in the state disagreed with the deal, while only 34 percent approved.     Cruz has framed Indiana as an "absolutely pivotal" last stand. Last week, he named former rival Carly Fiorina as his running mate to boltser his campaign.     There are 57 delegates up for grabs in winner-take-most Indiana, and Trump is the only remaining GOP candidate who can reach the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination before the party's convention in July.     "I agree that Indiana is incredibly important," he told "Fox News Sunday." "Regardless of what happens in Indiana, Donald Trump is not getting to 1,237. No one's getting to 1,237. We are heading to a contested convention."    Of the last seven polls in Indiana, only an Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne survey had Cruz ahead, with a 16-point lead.    In more good news for Trump, Indiana voters picked him over Hillary Clinton, 48 to 41 percent, in a hypothetical matchup.     "We can't continue to allow China to rape our country, and that's what they are doing," he said at a rally in Fort Wayne, Ind. "It's the greatest theft in the history of the world." 
December 5, 2016	 The New York Post	   President-elect Donald Trump launched a Twitter attack against China on several issues Sunday - as reports emerged saying that his controversial call with Taiwan was meant to be an intentional slap in the face to the communist nation.      Several insiders who helped plan Friday's historic chat told The Washington Post that Trump had been secretly plotting to provoke the superpower for months and that the conversation with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen had been in the works for weeks.    "They knew that there would be reaction and potential blowback," Stephen Yates, a former national-security official and expert on China and Taiwan, told The Post.     "Once the call was scheduled, I was told that there was a briefing for President-elect Trump," he said.    A spokesman from President Tsai's office added, "Of course both sides agreed ahead of time before making contact."    The call between the United States and Taiwan - a diplomatic first since 1979 - was part of Trump's new strategy to send a message to China that the new president intended to play rough, the insiders said.    Right after the billionaire won the election, his campaign team began compiling a list of foreign leaders to speak with in the weeks to follow, and the Chinese rival was reportedly one of his top choices.    Meanwhile, Trump fired off a pair of tweets Sunday - blasting China for devaluing America's currency and taxing US products - which seemed to reflect his new strategy.    "Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?" Trump wrote at about 5:30 p.m. "I don't think so!"     The "military complex" reference was apparently aimed at an artificial reef the Chinese have built in the South China Sea that can support a military base.     "China is the big abuser,"he said during the campaign, calling Beijing and other nations "grand masters at monetary manipulation."    Sunday's tweets came after China lodged a complaint with the United States on Saturday over the call with Taiwan. China considers Taiwan to be part of its nation, and in deference to that, the United States has walked a fine line and not had top-level talks with Taiwanese leaders in a generation.    The Trump camp has chosen to downplay the phone call, with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and aides coming to Trump's defense Sunday.     "He took the call, accepted her congratulations and good wishes and it was precisely that," Pence said Sunday on ABC's "This Week."    Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, Trump's former campaign manager, told "Fox News Sunday" that "it was just a phone call." 
March 27, 2016	 The New York Post	  Donald Trump wants US allies to ante up if they want to continue under the "cloak of American protection," according to his first detailed comments on his foreign-policy platform.     "We're not being reimbursed for the kind of tremendous service that we're performing by protecting various countries," the Republican front-runner was quoted as saying.   Trump said he would boycott oil from Saudi Arabia and other allies ­unless they provide troops or funds to fight ISIS.     "If Saudi Arabia was without the cloak of American protection . . . I don't think it would be around," he told The New York Times.   Trump is open to removing US forces from Japan and South Korea if they did not take on the cost of housing and feeding troops on American bases there, the report said.     "We defend everybody. When in doubt, come to the United States. We'll defend you. In some cases free of charge," he said.     He vowed to renegotiate the Iran deal to extend restrictions on the country's ability to build nuclear weapons while also allowing Iran to buy planes and other goods made in the United States.     The United States, in Trump's view, has lost power economically and militarily for decades. He cited the Teddy Roosevelt era as the period when America's might peaked.    "We have been disrespected, mocked and ripped off for many, many years by people that were smarter, shrewder, tougher," he said.   Trump vowed to restore the country's role as a global superpower. He suggested the United States has acted like a "big bully" and was "not smartly led."    "I wouldn't want them to know what my real thinking is," he said. "I would use trade, absolutely, as a bargaining chip."    He defended US surveillance of allies like Israel and Germany, saying, "They're spying against us."    Trump said he would allow Japan and South Korea to develop their own nuclear programs instead of depending on America for protection from China and North Korea.    He wouldn't rule out using nuclear weapons against an adversary, saying he would use nukes as an "absolute last step."    But Trump held out hope he could facilitate the greatest deal of them all - lasting peace in Israel. 
December 17, 2016	 The New York Post	  A Chinese warship seized an underwater drone deployed by an American oceanographic vessel in international waters in the South China Sea, triggering a US protest and demand for its return, officials said.     The incident took place Thursday northwest of Subic Bay off the Philippines as the US Navy ship USNS Bowditch - which has a civilian crew - was about to retrieve the ­unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), Reuters reported.    The drone was part of an unclassified program to collect oceanographic data, including salinity, temperature and other scientific facts used for sonar operations, a US official said.    "The UUV was lawfully conducting a military survey in the waters of the South China Sea," the official said. "It's a sovereign immune vessel, clearly marked in English not to be removed from the water - that it was US property."    Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the United States ­issued a formal complaint but he was unaware of any ­response. He said this may be the first time in recent history that China has taken a US naval vessel.    The Bowditch had already retrieved another drone and was 500 yards from the seized device when a Chinese Dalang ­III-class vessel grabbed it.     The Chinese ship acknowledged a radio call from the Bowditch but did not respond to US demands, according to Davis.    "The only thing they said after they were sailing off into the distance was, 'We are returning to normal operations,' " he said. No shots were fired, he added.    The Pentagon said the 10-foot-long drone used commercially available technology and sold for about $150,000, but it stressed that China had seized US military property.    Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the seizure occurred in the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines, not China, and ­appeared to be a violation of international law.     The Chinese action heightened US concerns about the country's tactics in the disputed sea - including its militarization of maritime outposts.    An American think tank reported this week that new satellite images showed that China has installed weapons - including anti-aircraft and anti- missile systems - on all seven artificial islands it has built in the sea, Reuters reported.    The incident comes after President-elect Donald Trump has questioned the United States' "One China" foreign policy, in which formal relations are kept with Beijing and not Taiwan. With  Post Wires 
January 7, 2017	 The New York Post	  Russian President Vladimir Putin personally ordered an unprecedented cyber campaign to undermine Hillary Clinton and boost Donald Trump during the presidential election, an intelligence report claimed Friday.    The 25-page report prepared by the CIA, FBI and National Security Agency said Russia has consistently tried to disrupt "the US-led liberal democratic order" but the recent hacking "demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity and scope of effort compared to previous operations."    No evidence was presented to back up that conclusion, with officials saying that information had to remain secret.     "This document's conclusions are identical to the highly classified assessment, but this document does not include the full supporting information, including specific intelligence on key elements of the influence campaign," the report said.    Among the findings was that Putin had harbored a years-long grudge against Clinton after she slammed his autocratic rule while she was secretary of state.    "Putin most likely wanted to discredit Secretary Clinton because he has publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime . . . and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him," the report said.    Putin preferred Trump, it said, because he had spoken about improving relations with Russia and would be a partner in battling Islamic terrorism.    "Putin publicly indicated a preference for President-elect Trump's stated policy to work with Russia, and pro-Kremlin figures spoke highly about what they saw as his Russia-friendly positions on Syria and Ukraine," it read.    "Moscow also saw the election of President-elect Trump as a way to achieve an international counterterrorism coalition against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant," the report said, using another name for ISIS.    The Russians and their spy agency GRU orchestrated cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee and Clinton aide John Podesta and fed hacked e-mails to WikiLeaks, DC Leaks and a Russian-linked hacker named Guccifer, the report said.     Russia's state-sponsored English-language TV network RT also repeatedly slammed Clinton and praised Trump in its programming, the report said.   Trump has repeatedly scoffed at the allegations of Russian involvement and earlier Friday called the probe a politically motivated "witch hunt."    But after meeting with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan and FBI Director James Comey at Trump Tower Friday, he acknowledged Russian cyberattacks - but insisted there was no evidence Russia influenced the outcome of the presidential election.    "While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines," Trump said in a statement.    He did not reveal what was said in the briefing or whether he agreed with the report - which did not consider whether Russia's actions affected the election's outcome.    "I had a constructive meeting and conversation with the leaders of the Intelligence Community. I have tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women of this community to our great nation," he said.    "There were attempts to hack the Republican National Committee, but the RNC had strong hacking defenses and the hackers were unsuccessful," he said.    "Whether it is our government, organizations, associations or businesses we need to aggressively combat and stop cyberattacks. I will appoint a team to give me a plan," Trump said. 
April 28, 2016	 The New York Post	  Donald Trump gave his first foreign-policy speech on Wednesday, attacking President Obama and Hillary Clinton for their "reckless, rudderless and aimless" strategies while vowing, if elected, to take a more ­restrained, non-interventionist ­approach.    "Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction," Trump said. "The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy.    "No American citizen will ever feel that their needs come second to a citizen of a foreign country . . . I will be America's greatest defender and most loyal champion."     If the theme was familiar, the delivery was not. A newly presidential Trump adopted a serious tone and relied on a teleprompter instead of speaking off the cuff, as he has on the campaign trail.    "We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism . . . I'm skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down. And under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs," he said, citing the North American Free Trade Agreement.    Setting up a November showdown with Clinton - who is more hawkish than Obama - Trump sought to portray himself as a disciplined leader who would steer clear of nation-building at the expense of US interests.      He charged that the Clinton-Obama team created chaos by meddling abroad, citing the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, the intervention in Libya and stepped-up military action in Syria.    He singled out then-Secretary of State Clinton's handling of the deadly attacks on the US compound in Benghazi, Libya.    "I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign-policy vision of Obama-Clinton," Trump told an audience at The Mayflower hotel in Washington, DC. "It has been a complete and total disaster."    He also pointed to the threat posed by ISIS, the US's relationship with Israel and the danger radical Islam poses to the world.    He pledged his presidency would focus on "regional stability - not radical change" - in the Middle East.   Trump blamed administrations after Ronald Reagan's - which included that of Republican George W. Bush - for veering "badly off course."    "We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign-policy disaster after another," he said.    "They just kept coming and coming. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama's line in the sand in Syria."    "Simple message for ISIS: Their days are numbered. I won't tell them where, I won't tell them how . . . We, as a nation, must be more unpredictable," Trump said.    Fresh off a sweep of five East Coast primaries, Trump sought to expand on foreign-policy views that have lacked detail and led critics to contend he wasn't presidential.   Trump spoke to an invited audience of conservative-leaning national-security experts, as well as foreign-policy writers and politicians.    * Steer foreign policy in a noninterventionist direction while protecting America's interests. "We're getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world."    * America first: "We will no longer surrender this country, or its people, to the false song of globalism."    * Ease tensions with China and Russia: "Some say the Russians won't be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can't make a good deal for America, then we will quickly walk from the table."    * Defeat ISIS: "I have a simple message for them: Their days are numbered. I won't tell them where and I won't tell them how. We must, as a nation, be more unpredictable."    * Build up military, but deploy as a last resort. "I will never send our finest into battle unless necessary - and will only do so if we have a plan for victory. Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction." 
January 17, 2017	 The New York Post	 China has threatened to "take off the gloves" if Donald Trump keeps needling Beijing, the country's state-run media reported on Monday.   Trump suggested on Friday that the US policy of recognizing "one China" to exclude Taiwan is open to negotiation.    "If Trump is determined to use this gambit on taking office, a period of fierce, damaging interactions will be unavoidable, as Beijing will have no choice but to take of the gloves," the English-language China Daily said in an editorial.  
October 23, 2016	 The New York Post	  Donald Trump delivered his "closing argument" to the presidential election in historic Gettysburg, Pa., on Saturday, invoking Abraham Lincoln as he vowed to unite a divided country and set it on course with a series of policies he intends to put in place during his first 100 days in office.     The populist wish list - a push to set a presidential, policy-driven tone for his campaign's final 17 days - included tax cuts, term limits, school choice and regulatory reform in a speech he called "a contract between Donald J. Trump and the American voter."     "Change has to come from outside our very broken system," said Trump, who lags behind Hillary Clinton in most national polls and ended another bruising week during which he refused to say he would accept the election results.     Pledging to "drain the swamp" of Washington, DC, he said he would fight for a constitutional amendment to limit congressional terms and to trim the fat from the federal bureaucracy.     "For every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated," he told a crowd of about 500 in a ballroom at the Eisenhower Hotel and Conference Center.   Trump also said he would bar White House and congressional employees from taking lobbying jobs for five years after leaving government service and would freeze federal hiring.    A seven-point list of economic promises included his stump lines on renegotiating NAFTA and labeling China a currency manipulator and a new pledge to pull billions of dollars for UN climate-change efforts.    He touted tax relief, promising middle-class families with two children a 35 percent tax cut and vowing to reduce corporate taxes from 35 percent to 15 percent.    He also said he would thwart big media mergers, like the deal for AT&T to buy Time Warner, "because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few" - and because the media is part of the "rigged system" aligned against his campaign.    "The media is trying to poison the mind of the American voter," the tycoon charged. "Deals like this destroy democracy."     To "restore security and the constitutional rule of law," he said he would immediately repeal executive orders issued by President Obama, deport criminal undocumented immigrants and restrict immigration through "extreme vetting."    "We want people who love our country or who can love our country," he said. "There are ways of determining that."   Trump said he was honored to speak on "hallowed ground" at the center 4¹/  miles from where Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address in 1863.      "President Lincoln served in a time of division like we've never seen before," he said. "It is my hope that we can look at his example to heal the divisions we are living through right now. We are a very divided nation."     "This speech gave us a troubling view as to what a Trump State of the Union would sound like - rambling, unfocused, full of conspiracy theories and attacks on the media, and lacking in any real answers for American families," said spokeswoman Christina Reynolds.  
November 19, 2016	 The New York Post	  Legendary distressed investor Wilbur Ross, who is said to be on President-elect Donald Trump's short list for Commerce secretary, knows firsthand the benefits of a tough trade policy with China.     Back in 2002, with the US steel industry in tatters, Ross agreed to buy the assets of bankrupt steel maker LTV Corp.    The 78-year-old investor believed the Bush White House, looking to save thousands of jobs in the beleaguered industry, would soon slap stiff tariffs on Chinese steel that many believed was being dumped into the country at below-market prices, a source familiar with the situation said.    "His team asked [then-Commerce Secretary] Donald Evans if there would be more protectionist measures and he said absolutely," said the source of Ross and his colleagues.    Less than a month after Ross bought LTV, President George W. Bush imposed tariffs on imported steel that raised the prices about 20 percent - arguably saving the distressed steel industry in the United States.     Ross told The Post, "We had already acquired LTV before I approached the administration about putting on the tariffs that had been recommended by the International Trade Commission.    Ross' firm, WL Ross & Co., followed the LTV purchase with acquisitions of Weirton Steel, Acme Steel, Bethlehem Steel and Georgetown Steel to form International Steel Group.    His firm sold International Steel Group in 2005 to Lakshmi Mittal for $4.5 billion - half in cash and half in stock - pocketing a profit of more than 12 ¹/  times its investment, according to media reports at the time.     "It was the right decision to make," Ross told trade publication American Metal Market about the tariffs. "There were probably 100,000 jobs saved by virtue of the changes the tariffs brought."    Ross declined to comment about being considered for Commerce secretary, but he certainly knows a thing or two about Chinese imports.    President-elect Trump has railed against America's trade policies with China, and said during the campaign he would like to see 45 percent tariffs against some Chinese imports.    The company needs the "countervailing tariffs that had already been in place and are already proposed to return in both Europe, the US and elsewhere to deal with dumping from China," Ross said.  
January 12, 2017	 The New York Post	  Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of state on Wednesday took a tougher stance on Russia than the president-elect - calling the country dangerous because of its global ambitions and bombing of civilians.     "Russia today poses a danger, but it is not unpredictable in advancing its own interests. It has invaded Ukraine, including the taking of Crimea, and supported Syrian forces that brutally violate the laws of war," Rex Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at his confirmation hearing.    "Our NATO allies are right to be alarmed at a resurgent Russia," said the ExxonMobil CEO, adding that Russia had no right to invade and annex Crimea in 2014 - and that if Moscow tried to seize more territory by force, the United States and its allies should stop it.    "If Russia acts with force, that requires a proportional show of force that there will be no more taking of territory," Tillerson said.    He charged that the Obama administration was overly timid in its response to the annexation of Crimea, and should have told the Russians that the land grab "stops right here."    But he refused to call Vladimir Putin a war criminal when pressed about the Russian president's brutal repression at home and military action abroad.    "I would not use that term," Tillerson told Sen. Marco Rubio, who has said he has "serious concerns" about Trump's pick for America's top diplomatic post.    Rubio (R-Fla.) said Russia's seizing of Crimea, targeting of innocent civilians in Aleppo and support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should not make it hard to say that Putin committed war crimes.    Tillerson said also it's a "fair assumption" that Putin orchestrated Moscow's meddling in the US 2016 presidential election.    He opposed US sanctions levied on Moscow following its annexation of the Crimean peninsula, penalties that cost ExxonMobil hundreds of millions of dollars.    Asked whether Trump agreed with his tough positions, the oilman said he had only a general conversation with the president-elect on the topic - "in a broad construct and in terms of the principals that are going to guide" Russia policy, he said.     Tillerson also said that if China doesn't enforce UN sanctions on North Korea, the United States should consider actions that would compel Beijing to comply.    He vowed to fight ISIS, and said he rejected Trump's inflammatory comments about Mexican "rapists" crossing the border.    "Mexico is a longstanding neighbor and friend of this country," he said. "I would never characterize an entire population with any single term."  
June 6, 2016	 The New York Post	The Issue: Hillary Clinton's foreign-policy speech, in which she portrayed Donald Trump as "dangerous."    It was important to hear Hillary Clinton speculate about the potential failures of Donald Trump's foreign policy ("Hillary Describes Hillary," Editorial, June 3).     The Post can spin what Hillary said about Trump all it wants, but the truth is he's an imperious, impetuous man-boy who shouldn't have knowledge of the nuclear codes.      No wonder President Obama and Clinton messed things up around the world over the last seven years. They don't even know what foreign policy is.     That's what she'll do with the Iran nuke problem? Tell us we should be afraid of Trump? That's how she'll deal with ISIS, Russia and China? John Scott    All she has on him are hypotheticals and what he might have said at some point. She's baiting him to say something that will cost him dearly.     What I do care about, however, is how she conducted herself as secretary of state. She didn't act in the best interests of the United States or its partners.    Nothing positive came from any of her decisions. After all the lies over the Iranian deal, how can the people trust her?  
December 7, 2016	 The New York Post	  Donald Trump on Tuesday demanded that the government cancel a deal with Boeing for two new Air Force One jets because, he claimed, it's too expensive.    "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" he wrote on Twitter.     He later elaborated at Trump Tower, suggesting the aeronautics firm was "doing a little bit of a number" to pad its bottom line.     "The plane is totally out of control," he said. "It's going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program, and I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money."    A March 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office estimated the overall cost of the replacement program at $3.21 billion, including the purchase of two planes.    But the GAO estimated the costs for research and development would be lower, at just under $2 billion, while the Air Force said R&D costs would be closer to $2.8 billion. If the GAO report used the same Air Force estimate for R&D, its estimate would be around the $4 billion Trump cited.    Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said the two new planes cost so much because the jets require state-of-the-art security as well as defense and communications systems.      "It really is, in many ways, a flying White House, in terms of the security," James told Politico. "There's [electronic] countermeasures built in, communications, very high- level communications, security of all types. So it is a bit more complicated than perhaps meets the eye."    "We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program, allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer," it read.    Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg - a staunch free-trade advocate - has cast a wary eye on the billionaire's possible trade policies.     The company sells hundreds of jets to China, a nation Trump has threatened to punish with steep tariffs.    "Anyone who paid attention to the recent campaign and the election results realizes that one of the overarching themes was apprehension about free and fair trade," Muilenburg told the Illinois Manufacturers' Association last week in comments that may have caused a backlash from Trump.    The Chicago Tribune reported the comments Tuesday morning on its Web site just 22 minutes before Trump went after Boeing.     Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state, where the jets will be built, tweaked Trump and praised Boeing workers, whose jobs would be at risk if the contract were canceled.    "I hope the president-elect takes the time to talk to the Pentagon and the Air Force and Boeing about how defense contracts work before he tweets," she said.  
December 9, 2016	 The New York Post	  Here's the scenario: Washington suddenly makes an unusual move in Asia that China doesn't like. Beijing's public response is measured, but it works behind the scenes to undermine US-led diplomacy. After a few months, Beijing cools off and resumes its cooperation.    A possible future historical account of last week's much-publicized phone call between Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen and President-elect Trump? Nope. It's a story that already took place this year.     In July, reacting to North Korea's nuclear and missile tests, Washington and Seoul announced their intention to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (anti-missile) system on South Korean soil. China's response was swift. After some nuanced foreign ministry statements, came the real reaction - and in an arena the Obama administration considers its forte: multilateral diplomacy.    As a senior UN diplomat described it, his Chinese colleagues have been warming up to the idea of toughening Security Council sanctions on North Korea. After bouncing ideas around with their American counterparts, they suddenly clammed up. Any attempt to work on a sanctions resolution was met with cold silence.    Yet last week, bingo: The UN Security Council unanimously - China included - agreed on what victorious US diplomats described as "the toughest sanctions resolution in history." (OK, they always say that - but still . . . )    Why the Chinese zigzag? One reason Beijing props up the North Korean regime is fear: If Kim Jong Un's oppressive regime collapses and the peninsula unites under Seoul's rule, China will be surrounded by strong pro-American democracies.    True, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan don't undermine China's authoritarian regime by their mere existence. But, in Beijing's view, they may one day threaten China militarily. American THAADs near China's borders, though defensive, are a scary step in that direction.    Which explains why its diplomats refused, for months after the THAAD announcement, to even contemplate a UN sanctions resolution against North Korea.     On the other hand, Pyongyang's crazed antics are beyond the pale even for Beijing's leaders, as anti-American as they may be. They're increasingly realizing that the kooks of the North are totally out of control.    So China's UN hands returned to the negotiation table and, together with American diplomats, forged a sanctions resolution meant to put the fear of god in godless Kim.    The resolution, which passed last week, would threaten the North's meager legitimate sources of foreign currency, mainly coal exports to China. Adept Chinese diplomats made sure nothing in the resolution would actually jeopardize Kim's hold on power.     Beijing will decide if and how much it'll actually enforce the restrictions. To date, China's enforcement of sanctions has been sketchy.    So, no, a UN punishment that China helped write won't likely end the North's nuclear and missile programs. In fact, instead of selling coal to China, Kim may amp up sales of missiles and nuke components to wealthy unsavory actors.    Yet, clearly something needs to be done about Pyongyang's recklessness. As President Obama reportedly intimated in his White House post-election meeting with Trump, North Korea emerges as the biggest threat on the new president's national-security horizon.    America should certainly cooperate with China and push it to lean on its next-door ally. Trump's pick of Beijing-friendly Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad for ambassador to China can help there. (Branstad can also help manage tricky trade issues.)    But we also must make clear to Chinese strongman Xi Jinping that there will be consequences for propping up a murderous regime that threatens the region and the world. After all, Kim is now developing the means to attack us - on our own soil.    In short order, Trump would do well to announce that the only good outcome is a unified, democratic Korea. Unification won't happen tomorrow morning, but declaring that goal publicly may prompt China (after some initial fit-throwing) to rethink some of its policies toward Pyongyang.    America must help Beijing's pragmatic leaders recognize that disarming the North's madman - and eventually getting rid of him - is in their interest, not just ours.    For that matter, Trump's violating some unofficial protocol by publicly acknowledging a call from Taiwan's democratically elected leader - who's been a thorn in Beijing's side - is a good first step.     It signals that America will no longer kowtow to Beijing's whims. Instead, we'll look out for our own interests, which also happen to be those of China's neighbors, and even China itself. 
December 31, 2016	 The New York Post	  The stock market ended 2016 with a whimper on Friday, a muted close for the most dramatic year for investors since the financial crisis, as major indexes were rocked by seismic shifts in the global political order from the US to China.     The Dow Jones industrial average smashed through record after record this year, with at least 20 sessions concluding at all-time highs before ending the year up 13 percent. More than half the gains this year for the Dow have come since Nov. 8, after Donald Trump was elected president.     "Since Election Day, the returns have been parabolic," Sam Stovall, an analyst at CFRA, told The Post.     On Friday, the year's last trading day, the index fell slightly, by 0.3 percent, to 19,762.60. Still, it finished with its third-highest yearly gain since the end of the financial crisis eight years ago.    That tells only part of the story of a volatile year: The Dow ended up rising more than 25 percent from its low point in February, to its all-time high of 19,987.63 on Dec. 20 .    Other broad measures of US stocks also logged solid gains. The S&P 500, which has a broader range of US companies, rose 9.4 percent, to 2,238.83. The Nasdaq Composite, which largely tracks technology stocks, ended the year up 7.5 percent, to 5,383.12. Chipmaker Nvidia led both those indexes, more than tripling in value, after announcing that it will work with Chinese company Baidu to develop self-driving cars.     Wall Street started the year in a bad way, as the price of oil collapsed and fears about China's economy sent investors scrambling. The Dow fell 1,078.58 points during the first five days, making for the worst-ever start to the year.     On June 24, after the UK shocked the world with a vote to leave the European Union, stocks tanked around the world. About $420 billion was wiped out of the S&P 500 that day alone. The British pound collapsed 10 percent against the dollar and never recovered.     Wall Street had assumed that Hillary Clinton would win the election. Some of the biggest CEOs, including JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs' Lloyd Blankfein, openly supported her.     Late on Nov. 8, after it was clear that Clinton had lost three crucial states - and would therefore lose the election - Dow Jones futures had collapsed, and investors predicted that stocks would open down about 750 points.     The opposite happened. After digesting the news, investors bought everything in sight, based on assumptions that Trump would cut corporate taxes, spend billions on infrastructure programs and reduce regulations. Caterpillar was the Dow's biggest gainer, rising more than 36 percent.     The Trump rally lasted more than 40 days, sending the Dow across 19,000 just two days before Thanksgiving, and ending just below 20,000 for the final two weeks of the year.  
June 24, 2016	 The New York Post	  If Donald Trump beats Hillary Clinton, it'll be because he speaks directly to the voters - without the poll-driven, focus-grouped blandifying filter Hillary never leaves home without.    l  He delivered a thumping speech full of applause lines that spoke directly to what regular Americans see as the nation's problems.     Lines like: "We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place."     And: "We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed. This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats."    Above all, he noted that her campaign slogan is "I'm with her" - and gave his response: "I'm with you: the American people."     l  The same day, Clinton gave her own big speech - where, when her TelePrompTer said "(sigh)," she actually said the word rather than make the noise. Scripted much, Hillary?    And her content was just the same old tired list of Democratic talking points: She wants to hike taxes on Wall Street, big corporations and the super-rich, and keep raising the minimum wage.     OK, those ideas don't poll badly - but this was her big speech on the economy. How is any of it going to create jobs?     Whereas Trump early on talked up "jobs, jobs, jobs" - with specifics on where they're coming from, from broad tax cuts to unleashing the US energy industry.    And, yes, cutting better trade deals - something that Clinton joins the NeverTrumpers in painting as an unthinkable nightmare.    Bubba took office in 1993 with NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, already a done deal. But Democratic special interests - unions, the green lobby - didn't like it, so he made more concessions to Mexico and Canada in order get major "labor and environmental side accords" added on.   Trump can similarly open up Obama's Trans-Pacific trade deal - this time dumping items that Obama inserted to please his favored special interests in order to get a deal that's better for American workers and businesses.    There's no reason Trump can't (eventually) do the same on NAFTA and other standing deals. And none of it risks a trade war.    How much good it'll do, I can't say - I put more faith in the rest of his pro-growth program, particularly the energy policies.     But tens of millions of voters see trade as a huge issue, one where the establishment has ignored their perfectly valid concerns for a generation - when it hasn't smugly dismissed them as ignorant.    Yes, Trump can get harsh when he's talking trade (and other issues). But how else does he show he means it?     Mitt Romney made tough noises on trade with China (and on immigration, too). Nobody believed him, because he was so plainly a guy who would wilt under establishment pressure.    Fine, I wince at some point whenever I watch Trump. But I've been wincing at every Republican nominee since Reagan; every one of them still got my vote.     And if you look at Trump's actual program, he's not even close to being off the GOP reservation - he's just opened the door to Americans who've quite rightly been feeling left out.    Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, is horrible. Trump was utterly on point in saying she's "spent her entire life making money for special interests - and taking money from special interests." How else do you get stinking rich after 2½ decades in public service?    At heart, she may not be as radical as President Obama or Bernie Sanders - but what difference, at this point, does it make? She's also in hock to every special interest in the Democratic Party - she's fully embraced Obama's entire domestic agenda, and if she wins she'll get to remake the Supreme Court so she can impose it.   Trump had it right again: "My message is that things have to change - and this is our one chance to do it. This is our last chance to do it." 
November 14, 2016	 The New York Post	  Former Wall Street Journal scribe Asra Nomani is a woman, immigrant and Muslim, and she agrees with the Democratic Party's positions on social issues and global warming. But she voted for Trump. As she writes in The Washington Post, "I am a single mother who can't afford health insurance under Obamacare. The president's mortgage-loan modification program, 'HOPE NOW,' didn't help me . . . I see rural America and ordinary Americans, like me, still struggling to make ends meet, after eight years of the Obama administration." And there's another reason: As a Muslim reformer, "What worried me the most were my concerns about the influence of theocratic Muslim dictatorships, including Qatar and Saudi Arabia, in a Hillary Clinton America . . . We have to stand up with moral courage against not just hate against Muslims, but hate by Muslims."    The narrative emerging of a rash of Donald Trump-inspired hate crimes is populated by hoaxes, as Elizabeth Nolan Brown points out at Reason. A Muslim female student in Louisiana had her claim of being assaulted by racists in Trump hats went viral - until she admitted she made it up. A young San Diego Muslim woman's tale of being targeted for theft by Trumpers didn't quite hold up. A supposed gay bashing by Trump fans in Santa Monica is falling apart. Same goes for a supposed racist attack in Delaware and an anti-Asian incident in Minnesota. "Less dramatic acts of racism . . . do seem to be bubbling up more frequently this week," she writes. But that's "a world apart from the wave of 'hate crimes' and violent attacks that many are conjuring up right now."    Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and self-described socialist whom Hillary Clinton beat for the Democratic nomination this year, isn't surprised Trump won. Writing in The New York Times, he says Trump tapped into the fact that Americans "work longer hours for lower wages as they see decent paying jobs go to China, Mexico or some other low-wage country . . . Many of their once beautiful rural towns have depopulated, their downtown stores are shuttered, and their kids are leaving home because there are no jobs." Sanders says he hopes Democrats realize all that Trump got right - because it's what they once claimed to stand for: "I believe strongly that the party must break loose from its corporate establishment ties and, once again, become a grass-roots party of working people, the elderly and the poor."    The Environmental Protection Agency drilled test wells in Wyoming supposedly to ensure nearby fracking wouldn't contaminate the groundwater. Complains of "foul-smelling water" soon followed. So the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality investigated, and has now determined that - surprise! - the contamination was caused by the EPA. Jazz Shaw at Hot Air writes: "The EPA well was drilled in a defective fashion. The artificial materials in the well almost certainly came from the drilling process when the EPA dug the wells." Plus, "the junk they allowed in there clogged the screens down at the base of the well. This allowed stagnant, standing water to build up at the bottom and it became infested with bacteria and biological agents." The claim that fracking contaminates groundwater is the myth that won't die, he says.    Some tech bigshots, writes Elaine Ou at Bloomberg, are suggesting California secede. Ou says it would go as well as the South's secession over slavery. The state needs America: "The Bay Area tech industry received much of its early funding from the US Navy for things like radios and aeronautics research, which created demand for vacuum tubes and San Jose's mercury mines. The biggest buyers of early silicon circuits were the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration." And that's not all: "Southern California gets most of its water from the Colorado River in Arizona, and the entire state's natural gas and oil supply arrives through pipelines coming from Texas. Many California-based companies are incorporated in Delaware, for the lower tax rates." 
November 27, 2016	 The New York Post	  the talk at  Donald Trump's Thanksgiving dinner at his Florida club was all about if he should pick  Mitt Romney or Rudy Giuliani for secretary of state.     The president-elect held court on Thursday at his Palm Beach, Fla., Mar-a-Lago club at a large table with family members including wife Melania and sons Eric and Barron.      One witness told us Trump took a prime table next to the fireplace in the club's living room, but spent a lot of time greeting members and asking who they think should be his top diplomat.    The spy said, "Donald was walking around asking everybody he could about who should be his secretary of state. There was a lot of criticism about Romney, and a lot of people like Rudy. There are also many people advocating for [former US ambassador to the UN] John Bolton."    On Friday it was reported that Trump wants Romney to publicly apologize for criticizing him during the campaign in order to be considered for secretary of state.    Guests joining Trump for Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago included Christopher Nixon Cox, the grandson of Richard Nixon, who we are told is being lined up to be Trump's ambassador to China. Also there was Marvel Entertainment CEO Ike Perlmutter, CEO of Newsmax Media Christopher Ruddy, boxing promoter Don King, interior designer William Eubanks and political consultant Mary Ourisman. Attracting almost as much attention as the president-elect was chiseled romance-novel hunk Fabio, who was seated at a table near Trump, and "was asked for pictures nearly as often as Trump himself."    Meanwhile, security was intense. The witness told us that Ocean Boulevard outside Mar-a-Lago was sealed off, and all vehicles were diverted to a nearby parking lot to be fully searched and checked by sniffer dogs. Entering the club, all members had to pass through airport-style metal detectors and have their bags searched. Once inside, "Secret Service agents were swarming everywhere. But Trump seemed relaxed, like he was in his own living room and surrounded by family." 
September 11, 2016	 The New York Post	  I made my October payment using Con Ed's pay-by-phone service, as I have been doing for years. Everything went smoothly, and I received a confirmation number. Then, in November, I received a notice from Con Ed stating that it never received the funds from my bank, JPMorgan Chase. I checked my balance, and had more than enough funds to cover it. This also happened with November's Con Ed bill.     I called Con Ed and spoke to one of its customer representatives, who told me it was having trouble with Chase releasing funds payable to Con Ed due to a new payment system that it had installed during the summer, and that I should go to my bank and tell it to release funds to the account of Con Ed of NY.     I went to my Chase branch located at 1901 86th St. in Brooklyn, and spent more than an hour with the branch manager. She made many calls to her tech people, who didn't know of any problems or what to do with the account info that I had been given.     She also made calls to Con Ed and seemed to get only the runaround. Con Ed did tell her my pay-by-phone privileges had been suspended for five months for nonpayment.     On March 9, 2016, I mailed the current bill along with a check for $1,613, the total amount owed, at the Bath Beach post office. The next month, I received a new bill for $1,826, and again sent a check for the total amount, mailed at same post office. I would greatly appreciate any help you can give with this matter. C.K.     Dear C.K.: I checked with Con Ed and didn't get the runaround. And while I didn't get a definitive answer, I'm sure your problem is now being fixed.    A spokesman for Con Ed said "We are in touch with the customer and seeking to resolve the matter."    He added that "several payments the customer tried to make failed, prompting us to put a block on the account. Once we removed the block, the payments still did not go through."    The spokesman said that "based on what we have learned so far, we do not believe the problem is with Con Edison's systems."     Addendum from C.K.: I want to take this opportunity to thank you for all your help in solving my payment problems with Con Edison. It's your intervention that got ConEd to assign Ms. Rodriguez to be my personal troubleshooter. Thank you again.    Dear John: Donald Trump's aggressiveness was learned from a very close business associate and friend.     It is interesting to note that infamous Roy Cohn was Trump's lawyer, mentor and friend for many years. Much of Trump's arrogance, brazenness and insulting aggressiveness is right out of Cohn's personal playbook.     It was Cohn who brought Trump into NYC's elite political circles and represented him in lucrative real estate deals. Once one knows the great influence Cohn had on Trump, it is not hard to recognize it in Trump's actions.      Those brazen actions could be his downfall but for what awaits Hillary in October in e-mails to be exposed and the movie "Clinton Cash." M.M.    Dear John: If the increasingly erratic Federal Reserve decides to shell out "helicopter" money, I don't think it would cause much of a jump in inflation.     That's because if "free money" caused a big increase in consumer demand, all it would do is ramp up some of the thousands of Chinese factories now sitting idle.     There's so much slack in the world economy that it would take an enormous dump of free money to make a difference. E.K.    Dear E.K.: OK, if you are correct, it would then increase the US trade deficit and allow China to accumulate trillions of dollars.     The Chinese would then hold those dollars in the form of US Treasurys, making it ever a bigger creditor and giving China, which doesn't particularly like us, more control over American policy.     Either way - and there are numerous bad outcomes - a money dump would not be good for the US, especially coming as it does after the QE policy that has created excess currency.  
March 3, 2016	 The New York Post	  All the noise about Donald Trump's "hostile takeover" of the Republican Party misses a key point: Such takeovers only succeed when existing management has failed massively.    Start with this: A few weeks ago, when Washington Post and New York Times reporters sought the Republican establishment's reaction to Trump, the folks they dug up to talk to were a bunch of consultants and lobbyists.    They're not (all) without principle, but they have a huge vested interest in the conventional fields and styles of combat that they've mastered - which earn them very, very good livings.    Really, they're no different from the lefty lobbyists now cashing in from their access to Mayor de Blasio.    And the Times-Post crowd wasn't wrong: They're the closest thing the GOP has to "wise men." There are no sage party elders to go to.     I asked Ed Cox, the New York GOP chief, about this not long ago. His reply: "If you find the Republican establishment, let me know - I can't find them anywhere."    Cox is President Richard Nixon's son-in-law; he's been around Republican politics for five decades. If he says there's no there there, there isn't.    Beyond the mercenaries, you've got a variety of pundits and talk-radio jocks - folks whose job is to entertain a (large) niche audience. They're focused on their niches - and inevitably view the general interest of the GOP, as well as the nation, through those blinders.    Much of the punditry's now pointing Trump-blame fingers at the GOP "donor class" for leading the party astray - bribing pols to embrace open borders, avoid social issues, etc., etc.    It's a fair point: You know all you need to about the donors' political judgment by noting that they dumped $150 million on Jeb Bush - when Jeb would've been a low-energy loser by now even if Trump was still off doing "The Apprentice." (The donors' other early fave, Scott Walker, dropped out even earlier, also for cause.)    But the money-men stumbled into this leading role because, ever since the Reagan years, the GOP regulars and the conservatives have been aiming for the Gipper's second coming merely by imposing ever-stricter ideological tests.    That has produced a stream of candidates competing over who can best mouth the catechism, plus somehow pick up enough other votes to take the White House.     Today, the main alternatives to Trump are Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio - each a specialist in pushing one or another set of right-wing buttons.     Cruz's best real moment so far came when he talked about trying to get his sister out of that crack house - everything else is a rehearsed performance.    Until last week, Rubio was just a smoother, more "uplifting" Cruz. Marco's far more loose, authentic and appealing now that he's trading low blows with Trump - he's a real person, rather than some bizarre savant finding the right mini-speech in his memory. Maybe the change has come in time . . .    Anyway, both offer pretty much the same "unify the party and add a few more voters somewhere" strategy for the general election that's been failing for the GOP since 1998.    The big early achievements of the Bush presidency were, at best, technocratic, not conservative: No Child Left Behind, the new Medicare prescription-drug entitlement and some temporary tax cuts.     Then came 9/11 - and soon the best and the brightest of the Republican Party gave us the Iraq debacle (much as the Democrats' best and brightest had given us Vietnam a generation before).    After that, conventional GOP thinking gave us John McCain and Mitt Romney nominations - neither a winner, nor even that good a competitor.    And Romney actually tried to win by reaching out to the very same voters that Trump's now locked up, and by using the same issues: In 2012, Mitt was a hawk on immigration and on China trade - he just couldn't make the voters believe it.    I can't say whether Trump will get my vote when the primaries come to our neck of the woods, but I don't resent his existence or his success, nor blame him for destroying the GOP. 
January 11, 2017	 The New York Post	  Each day brings fresh proof that America is hopelessly headed down the wrong track and needs to change direction. Meryl Streep's pompous attack on Donald Trump and his supporters at the Golden Globes is one example, and a second involves the heckling idiots who wore KKK outfits yesterday to smear Sen. Jeff Sessions during his confirmation hearing to be attorney general.    A third proof comes from the Mideast. Predictably, this one involves an Arab terrorist shedding Israeli blood.      Soon after Palestinian and Jordanian leaders railed against Trump's plan to move our embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a Palestinian truck driver mowed down a group of Israeli soldiers, killing four and injuring 16. Witnesses said the driver plowed into the soldiers (survivors, pictured), then put his truck in reverse to run over them again.     Israeli press reports say the driver attended an East Jerusalem mosque that featured a fiery sermon against Trump's plan. "He was very angry, and said transferring the embassy would lead to war," a cousin of the driver was quoted as saying.     The driver was shot and killed, but his excuse lives on. The terror attack will be cited even by well-meaning people as a reason not to move the embassy.     There's a word for such thinking - appeasement. In one form or another, appeasing Palestinians has been the policy of the United States and Europe for decades. It has failed miserably and ought to be ditched.     Palestinian appeasement means we don't do anything to stand up for ourselves or Israel that will upset the infamous Arab street. Give the bully your money and a veto over your actions and maybe he will spare your life.    The Obama administration took the policy to a whole new level. It gave the Palestinians boatloads of taxpayer cash, abandoned Israel and demanded it make suicidal agreements.     All it got in exchange was more Arab violence, which it invariably responded to by pushing Israel to cede more of its sovereignty. The White House even supported opponents of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the last election.     Then along comes Trump and, with the prospects of lasting peace fading into the realm of illusion, he decides a change is in order. True to form, he pledges a big one.     Israel supports moving our embassy because Jerusalem is its capital and embassies are almost always located in host nations' capitals. Yet while it has long been American policy to move the embassy, it never happened out of fear of stoking violence because Palestinians also claim Jerusalem as their capital.    So presidents accepted a stalemate and let fear stop them from doing what they should. Trump, thankfully, is not a fan of appeasement.    He hasn't taken office yet, but already his plan has come under fire from Mahmoud Abbas, leader of the Palestinian Authority. He reportedly wrote to Trump to warn that the embassy move would have a "disastrous impact on the peace process."     That, literally, would be impossible, since there is no peace process because Abbas refuses to negotiate with Israel. Instead, he wants the United Nations to impose borders and create a Palestinian state so he doesn't have to make any concessions to Israel, including its right to exist. Again, Obama encouraged that scam by failing to veto a UN resolution that called all Israeli settlements illegal, thus emboldening its enemies.    Arab media say Abbas also sent similar letters to the European Union, China and Russia urging them to prevent Trump from keeping his embassy promise.    Good luck with that. My guess is that Trump will not yield and that threats of Arab violence will only fortify his determination to chart a different course.    Here at home, economic, military and immigration changes of the magnitude that voters want and that Trump promises are also stoking the rage of reactionaries who like the status quo. That's the way to understand the tiresome lectures and nasty protests of the establishment elite.    Amidst the storm, the rest of us must stay calm and remember this: If everything really is fine the way it is, Trump would have lost. His victory is a mandate for change, so bring it on. 
December 8, 2016	 The New York Post	  WASHINGTON - It was full bore ahead Wednesday for Donald Trump's transition team, which announced Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as the next ambassador to China, while a third retired general was expected to be named to a top national-security post.     Branstad received the job offer directly from the president-elect at a meeting between the two on Tuesday in Trump Tower, aides said.    The diplomatic posting will be a busy one since Trump has already unsettled diplomatic norms by taking a phone call from the democratically elected leader of Taiwan.    The Iowa governor has had a relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping since 1985, when he visited Iowa on a cultural exchange. Branstad has visited the Communist country four times in the last seven years.    "Governor Branstad's decades of experience in public service and long-time relationship with President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders make him the ideal choice," Trump said in a statement.     Retired Gen. John Kelly was expected to take over the Department of Homeland Security, making a trio of generals to have high-powered civilian posts in the new administration. Retired Gen. Jim Mattis was named Tuesday night to be the next secretary of defense, and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn was appointed weeks ago to serve as national security adviser.    He is the most senior member of the military to have lost offspring in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Kelly left the military earlier this year. An official announcement was said to be coming next week.    McMahon, the former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment and wife of mogul Vince McMahon, ran unsuccessfully for US Senate from Connecticut in 2010 and 2012.    Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt will take charge of the Environmental Protection Agency, a source told The Post.    Pruitt, who was elected in the 2010 Tea Party wave, has filed lawsuits targeting the EPA and environmental policies of the Obama administration.    "The left is going to hate him in the EPA. They definitely don't want Pruitt, a rule-of-law guy who relishes a fight," said a source close to Pruitt. The source added Pruitt's not going to wreck the regulatory agency. "He wants to mend it, not end it." 
December 30, 2016	 The New York Post	  Facebook has developed censorship software that will allow the social-media site to operate in China, where it's been blocked since 2009, reports Kara Alaimo at The Washington Post. Yes, she says, "giving in to the demands of an undemocratic regime to obstruct free speech would set a dangerous precedent." But even a restricted Facebook "could ultimately destabilize the Chinese Communist Party." For one thing, it would finally allow Chinese people to connect to Western platforms and discuss sensitive topics more openly. But "the most subversive part" would be allowing them to "see how people in other parts of the world live." Because after watching those people "lambaste their leaders, practice a plurality of religions and give birth to multiple children with impunity, the Chinese might demand to do the same."    Donald Trump's election "ushers in a new challenge for homeland security and counterterrorism both at home and abroad," says the Cato Institute's A. Trevor Thrall. After all, the president-elect's name is on "scores of properties all over the United States and the world." Which makes them "vulnerable 'soft targets,' without any of the serious security measures surrounding American embassies or other government buildings." Indeed, several "are located in countries with significant serious civil unrest and instability," including many Muslim nations. And the "symbolic damage" of an attack on such targets "would be immense." The possibility has "political and security implications that go well beyond the legal question" of who should defend them.    Michelle Malkin at Real Clear Politics pens a tribute to Dr. Thomas Sowell, who's retiring at age 86 after more than three decades as a syndicated columnist (whose work often appeared on these pages). She recalls first reading Sowell's writings in college when that was considered "a subversive act." And "it remains so today," because "the prolific libertarian economist's vast body of work is a clarion rejection of all the liberal intelligentsia hold dear." Particularly the "corrosive . . . concept of perpetual and permanent racial victimhood," and how Sowell showed that "elites profit mightily at the expense of the alleged beneficiaries of government-coerced affirmative action." His "assessments were rooted not in fear or hatred or fanaticism or moral superiority, but in empirical evidence."    John Kerry's blast at Israel may have been "an act of liberation," allowing him to say "things in public that US diplomats usually say only behind closed doors." But Eli Lake at Bloomberg suggests the secretary of state's speech actually showed him to be "a man trapped in the past" - the "prisoner of a peace process from a bygone time." Because "2016 is not 1999" and "the Middle East is coming unglued." Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, the return of Russia and the growth of ISIS "have nothing to do with settlements in the West Bank." Says Lake: "It's worth marveling at the spectacle of Kerry's dire warnings about the survival of a peace process disconnected from the wars raging all around it."    Donald Trump's election "supposedly shocked the leadership of The New York Times into self-reflection, if not an outright reassessment of the way it reports on America and its politics." In fact, notes Warren Henry at The Federalist, editor Dean Baquet vowed to "remind ourselves that New York is not the real world." But "the problem with these mea culpas and modified, limited hang-outs," he says, "is that anyone familiar" with the paper's history "has seen this movie before." Which is why its coverage of the supposed hate-crime surge and its treatment of Trump's Cabinet appointments only "fuel the hysteria in the sort of people who treat The New York Times or the Southern Poverty Law Center as gospel." - Compiled by Eric Fettmann 
January 10, 2017	 The New York Post	   Donald Trump met Monday with Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, founder of the retail site Alibaba, and said the two would do "great things" for small business in the US.      "We had a great meeting. It's jobs," the president-elect told reporters at Trump Tower. "Jack and I are going to do some great things."     CNBC reported that Alibaba wants to create 1 million jobs in the United States over the next five years.     The company had 36,446 full-time employees as of March 31, most of them in China, according to SEC filings.    Ma said he and Trump (pictured Monday) discussed allowing US products such as "garments, wine and fruit" to be sold on Alibaba.     Meanwhile, Trump was bullish about his Cabinet picks, some of whom will sit for public confirmation hearings starting Tuesday on Capitol Hill.    "Confirmation is going great. I think they'll all pass," the president-elect said, in particular praising his selection for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.). 
December 12, 2016	 The New York Post	   Donald Trump  says he's smarter than your average president - so he doesn't need daily intelligence briefings.    "I get it when I need it," Trump told " Fox News Sunday ," explaining that  he refuses the opportunity to be briefed daily by security professionals on classified threats  the way President Obama  is .      "I'm, like, a smart person," Trump said. "I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years - could be eight years. I don't need that."    The boastful Trump - who once said he knows more than the US generals about fighting ISIS - said he trusts the three generals he has nominated for his Cabinet and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who receive intelligence briefings regularly.    Trump is opting for weekly updates and says intelligence officials can always contact him if a situation has worsened.     In a rare extended interview, Trump also said he is not "bound" to the "One China" policy unless China makes a new deal with him on trade, currency devaluation, North Korea and China's island building in the South China Sea.    "I fully understand the One China policy," Trump said of the longstanding US practice of following mainland China's lead in describing itself as the only true nation of China, which the president-elect disrupted by taking a phone call from Taiwan's president, "but I don't know why we have to be bound by a One China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things."    The New York billionaire is in the midst of trying to separate himself from his vast international business empire and leaving his namesake organization to his adult children.     "I am turning down billions of dollars of deals," Trump said of his current involvement. "I turned down seven deals with one big player, great player, last week, because I thought it could be perceived as a conflict of interest."    But he dismissed criticism that world governments are trying to curry favor with him through his businesses, such as by having foreign diplomats stay at Trump's hotel in Washington, DC.    "When I ran, everybody knew that I was a very big owner of real estate all over the world," he said. 
August 3, 2016	 The New York Post	  A baby started crying at his campaign rally in Ashburn, Va., and Trump at first shrugged off the interruption.     "Don't worry about that baby, I love babies . . . I hear that baby crying. I like it. What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry," he said.     "The mom's running around like - don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy, and that's what we want."    He then returned to his remarks about how China has "ripped us to shreds" - but then the baby started wailing again.     At that point, an annoyed Trump turned toward the mom and said, "Actually, I was only kidding. You can get the baby out of here . . . I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking."   Trump also revealed he plans to spend $100 million of his own money in his effort to become president.     "I put up a lot of money to fund my own campaign," he said. "I think I'm into this for over $60 million now . . . I'll probably be in for $100 million by the time I finish. Think of it, $100 million cash . . . and no tax deduction."    At the start of the event, a man identified as Lt. Col. Louis Dorfman gave Trump a Purple Heart - a US military decoration awarded to those who are wounded or killed while serving.    "I always wanted to get the Purple Heart," Trump said. "This was much easier, but I tell you it was such an honor."  
August 14, 2016	 The New York Post	  Dear John: I just read your response to a letter about your recent column on Trump, China and tariffs.    I agree with you, except for your take on the situation that exists between ourselves and China - "You'd be out on the street pretty quickly," you said.    All we have to do to ruin them is renege on our debt, which quite possibly we might do anyway. So they'd better not anger us. T.D.    I compared the US' situation with China to that of a tenant/landlord. We owe China lots of money, and as such we've reduced the amount of flexibility we have in demanding things from that country.     What happens even before that decision - when such a move is just rumored - is that the US will suddenly have to pay considerable more to borrow money from everyone. And - this is no small matter - we'll have to find investors willing to take China's place at the table.    The value of US bonds will collapse - as rates rise because of the new risk in owning them - and pension funds, municipalities, the Social Security "Trust Funds" and everyone else holding American bonds will get clobbered.    There's an old saying that goes something like this: "If I owe you $100, I'm in trouble. If I owe you a million dollars, you are in trouble."    Dear John: Wouldn't the simplest way for the Labor Department to determine how many jobs were created or lost month to month be by using Social Security FICA payroll deductions paid to the system, since everyone is required to make those payments, especially employers? C.F.    But then every bureaucrat who works on the Labor survey and everyone who works at the Census Bureau going house to house would be out of a job. And it would probably be considered a sin for the government to actually save money on these surveys.    Dear John: I attended Hudson Valley Community College and Brockport, a SUNY college, between 1966 and 1969. I can't remember how much I paid, but I earned all the money I needed for tuition, books, room and meals by working summer jobs.     Dear B.R.: I'm not going to take your bet - not only because I can't afford to put my salary on the line but because I agree with you.     Even if college expenses were only $10,000 a year - which they aren't - how could any kid make that kind of money (legally) in today's economy?     College costs, helped by easy-to-get student loans, have far outpaced other expenses over the years. Eventually college costs will need to come into line with reality, or a lot of schools will be going out of business and a lot of kids will be denied a college education.    And - this is very important - many kids and their families will make a very reasonable decision that jobs in the trades (plumbers, electricians, carpenters, etc.) aren't so bad after all.     I know that a lot of my salary these days is going to people who can fix things around my house that I can't. A lot of days, I wish I had entered one of those professions.     Look, I graduated from college in 1973 with very little debt, thanks to generous family members - and working summer jobs.  
December 24, 2016	 The New York Post	  President Obama stabbed Israel in the back Friday by refusing to block a contentious UN Security Council resolution that demands the Jewish state cease all development in occupied territories.    The resolution was first introduced by Egypt in cooperation with the Palestinians to consider settlement building in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank "a flagrant violation under international law."      Fourteen of the 15 other members of the Security Council voted in favor of the resolution. Its approval was met with sustained applause in the chamber.    A "no" vote by the US or any of the other four permanent members of the council - Russia, China, France or Great Britain - would have killed it.    "Our position is that there is one president at a time," said Ben Rhodes, the White House national security adviser. "President Obama is the president until Jan. 20, and we are taking this action of course as US policy."     He added that the administration is "certain" President-elect Donald Trump will take a different tack when he becomes commander in chief in January.     Moments after the vote, Trump, who on Thursday sided with Israel by opposing the resolution, vowed that US policies regarding the Middle East would soon change.    A vote had initially been planned on the resolution for Thursday, but Egypt backed off under pressure from Israel and a phone call from Trump.    Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, hearing that the White House may either abstain from the vote or would not veto the measure, began a flurry of diplomatic maneuvers and reached out to Trump to enlist his support, sources said.     On Thursday, Trump tweeted, "The resolution being considered at the United Nations Security Council regarding Israel should be vetoed."    After Egypt backed out to give Trump a chance to weigh in as president, four other members of the Security Council - New Zealand, Malaysia, Venezuela and Senegal - went ahead and reintroduced it.     Addressing the council afterward, Power said the "Security Council reaffirmed its established consensus that settlements have no legal validity."    "The United States has been sending the message that the settlements must stop - privately and publicly - for nearly five decades," she continued. "So our vote today is fully in line with the bipartisan history of how American presidents have approached both the issue - and the role of this body."    She also said the settlements have gotten so far out of control that they are endangering the two-state solution.    But incoming Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer slammed for letting Israel twist in the wind.    "Whatever one's views are on settlements, the UN is the wrong forum to settle these issues. The UN has been a fervently anti-Israel body since the days of 'Zionism is racism,' and, unfortunately, that fervor has never diminished," the New York senator said in a statement.    "Knowing this, past administrations - both Democratic and Republican - have protected Israel from the vagaries of this biased institution."    "Israel rejects this shameful anti-Israel resolution at the UN and will not abide by its terms," he said.    An Israeli official on Friday suggested that the Obama administration helped orchestrate the resolution.    2009: Obama tells the U.N. America does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements," but offers no serious criticism of Palestinians.    2010: Makes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leave through a side door after chilly White House meeting.    2011: Demands Israel negotiate with the Palestinian Authority - governed by Hamas and Fatah - with pre1967 border lines. Former Mayor Ed Koch said Obama threw "Israel under the bus."     * Pentagon leaks information that Israel attacked the Damascus, Syria, airport to stop a shipment of weapons to terrorist groups.    2014: Three Jewish teens, including an American, are kidnapped and murdered by Hamas. Obama administration calls for restraint.    * In middle of shooting war in the Gaza Strip, Obama administration tightens arms shipments to Israel.    * Doesn't immediately call Netanyahu after the Israeli leader wins reelection. Criticizes his "divisive rhetoric" about Arab Israelis.    * Over Israel's objections, cuts a deal with Iran to postpone development of nuclear weapons. Netanyahu opposed the accord "because it doesn't prevent Iran from getting nukes . . . It paves the way for Iran to get nuclear weapons."     Yesterday: Refuses to block a UN resolution condemning Israeli settlements, with US Ambassador Samantha Power voting to abstain (left) and allowing the measure to pass.  
December 16, 2016	 The New York Post	 China has launched a shot across Donald Trump's bow, with its US ambassador warning him its national sovereignty and territorial integrity are not "bargaining chips."     "The political foundation of China-US relations should not be undermined. It should be preserved," Cui Tiankai said Wednesday at a DC meeting with business leaders.    The remarks follow Trump's comments on the "One China" policy and his decision to take a call on Dec. 2 from the democratically elected leader of Taiwan.   
November 18, 2016	 The New York Post	  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe trekked to Trump Tower on Thursday, seeking clarity on the president-elect's positions on trade agreements and US-Asian alliances.     Faced with a nuclear-armed and unpredictable North Korea and a newly assertive China, both Japan and South Korea rely on US leadership and close military, diplomatic and trade ties with Washington.    If Donald Trump calls the relationship into question - as he did repeatedly on the campaign stump - it will mark a historic geopolitical shift.    Unmoored from Washington, Japan and South Korea may feel obliged to develop nuclear arsenals of their own or cut deals with US rival Beijing.    If Trump makes good on his protectionist rhetoric, or labels China a currency manipulator, he could spark a global trade war. But if he moves to protect regional allies' interests against China, he could win friends.     Abe arrived at the Fifth Avenue skyscraper in late afternoon and entered through a side entrance, dodging reporters.  ,  
December 18, 2016	 The New York Post	  President-elect Donald Trump is assembling a Cabinet designed to govern exactly as he promised he would during the campaign. Naturally, the left is freaking out.    To be fair, Trump is sticking to his guns far better than any Republican in living memory. Indeed, he's utterly ignored liberal shibboleths in making his picks.     For the record, incoming Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt is not a "climate- science denier." He simply doesn't accept the pseudo-scientific claims that the only thing that can save the planet is for the United States to de-industrialize even as China builds 40 new coal plants a year (and invests big in "clean coal" technology).    Nor is Attorney General-to-be Jeff Sessions any kind of racist. He got blindsided by such charges during confirmation hearings decades ago, but his public record since then includes successfully prosecuting the Alabama head of the Klan - which set up a civil suit that bankrupted the state branch of that hate group.    Yes, future Labor Secretary Andrew Puzder says massive increases in the minimum wage will kill jobs, pushing employers to replace people with robots. But that's mainstream economics - not even a uniquely Republican view.    What unites Trump's picks is that none of them is willing to pretend that Democrats' talking points actually describe reality. And that defiance perfectly matches Trump's refusal, all campaign long, to bow before the forces of political correctness.    The head of ExxonMobil as America's chief diplomat? No one seriously doubts that Rex Tillerson is qualified to run the $65 billion State Department: He ran a $370 billion multinational that negotiates with governments of all kinds. And, sorry, it's only greens and other lefties who think oil companies are uniquely malicious.    Yes, Tillerson will face some questions over his history cutting deals with Russia - but the driving force there is actually doubts about Trump's own often-expressed intention to try working with Vladimir Putin. We share those doubts - but they have nothing really to do with this nominee.    And if you're going to try to deal with Moscow, it makes sense to have somebody doing the dealing who has already done it without getting robbed.    The Trump Cabinet will feature almost no Washington insiders - which makes perfect sense for a guy who won by promising to "drain the swamp."     The hysteria over the president-elect's picks comes overwhelmingly from folks who like the swamp just fine as it is.    No less than Bernie Sanders last week pointed to a key Trump strength: He's "willing to take on everybody."    "One of the arguments as to why Trump won," Sanders noted last week on Chris Hayes' MSNBC show, "is the belief that most or many of his supporters are sexists or racists or homophobes. I happen not to believe that's the case. I think what he did do is he said, 'You know what, there's a lot of pain in this country, people are scared and people are worried.' People are tired of status quo politics. He broke through that." 
December 28, 2016	 The New York Post	  Media outlets across the world mistakenly believed a tweet that said Donald Trump would meet Tuesday with Republic of Congo President Denis Sassou to discuss the political crisis in Libya and other issues affecting Africa.      The statement was attached to a tweet sent out Monday by Sassou's spokesman, Thierry Moungalla. The Congolese president has been in power for nearly 32 years and chairs the African Union's High-Level Committee on Libya.    "They never met. It was never on the president-elect's schedule," Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said on Tuesday.   Trump has been staying during the holidays at his home in Palm Beach, Fla., where he has been meeting with staffers and interviewing possible picks for his administration.    He is scheduled to meet this week with Elsa Murano, who served as undersecretary of agriculture for food safety under President George W. Bush and who is a possible contender for agriculture secretary.    Since Trump was elected in November, his transition team said he has spoken by phone to numerous world leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President François Hollande, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
December 29, 2016	 The New York Post	  Democrats' obsession with the idea that racism was the main reason Donald Trump won isn't backed by the data. "This stereotyping of Trump voters is not only illiberal, it falsely presumes Mr. Trump won because of his worst comments about women and minorities rather than despite them," writes David Paul Kuhn in The New York Times. It's true that a pre-election poll found a majority of white working-class voters thought Trump lacked a sense of decency. "But they were not voting on decency," Kuhn points out. A post-election study found Trump improved over George W. Bush's winning coalition in 2000 "in areas hurt most by competition from Chinese imports . . . The study concluded that, had the import competition from China been half as large, Mrs. Clinton would have won key swing states and the presidency with them."    There were princesses in movies before Carrie Fisher played Princess Leia, but none quite like her, writes Eliana Dockterman in Time. "Leia Organa was the first pop-culture princess to take matters into her own hands, to boss up, to tell the male heroes what to do, and, literally, to save the galaxy," Dockterman says. "For that, she became instantly iconic." She fired a weapon as well as the boys, led troops "like Washington over the Delaware" and generally dressed like an action hero, not a princess. And even the big exception - her famous gold bikini as Jabba the Hut's chained hostage - ended when Leia "murders Jabba by choking him with the very chains that were supposed to keep her submissive. The glee shows on Fisher's face."    After the fall of the Soviet Union, writes The Boston Globe's Jeff Jacoby, socialism's useful idiots in the West looked for a new champion. And they found one in Hugo Chavez, "the anti-Yanqui rabble-rouser who was elected president of Venezuela in 1998 and in short order had transformed the country from a successful social democracy into a grim and corrupt autocracy." High oil prices hid the devastation awaiting what was once Latin America's most prosperous nation under Chavez's stifling socialism. Venezuelans now "face crippling shortages of everything from food and medicine to toilet paper and electricity. Violent crime is out of control." Despite the comforting myths of its Western cheerleaders, Jacoby says, "Socialism invariably kills and impoverishes."    House Republicans are proposing new rules for their chamber that would fine members for two kinds of disruptive behavior. Except one of them isn't really disruptive, explains Jazz Shaw at Hot Air. The new rules would fine members for blocking the well of the House - as Democrats did with their gun-control sit-in this past summer. That, Shaw says, is OK. But fining them for taking video and pictures on the floor and putting them out on the Web is silly. "The taxpayers fund the existence of the building and the salaries of everyone doing business there," Shaw writes. "Anything that happens inside that chamber (unless it's a discussion of sensitive, national security information) is our business."    In response to the UN Security Council vote against Israel last Friday, three GOP senators - Lindsey Graham (SC), Ted Cruz (Texas) and Tom Cotton (Ark.) - are working on plans to knock the United Nations, reports Josh Rogin in The Washington Post. "Some are considered 'micro' options, such as passing a resolution that would bar any funding that might go to implementing the anti-settlement resolution," Rogin writes. Others include "withdrawing the United States from UN organizations such as UNESCO or passing legislation to protect settlers who are American citizens and might be vulnerable to consequences of the resolution." "The Security Council's anti-settlement resolution has opened up a Pandora's box in Washington, allowing anyone with a grievance against the world body to have their day in the sun." -Compiled by Seth Mandel 
October 13, 2016	 The New York Post	  Bloomberg columnist Leonid Bershidsky, an "active opponent" of Vladimir Putin, says Russia's in trouble no matter who wins Nov. 8. Donald Trump "has no answers." But "I also have misgivings about Hillary Clinton." The problem: "Clinton's positions on Russia are based on simplistic ideological lines," mistakenly tying Putin to anti-immigrant "extreme nationalism." And "the mismatch between an ideological Clinton and an opportunist Putin is fraught." That, he says, "will enable Putin to step up anti-Western hysteria in Russia - and almost force him to pick up the gauntlet as soon as possible, before Russia collapses economically."    It's nothing "new for college students to indulge in self-righteous certainty, to be so intoxicated by a grand moral mission that they can't see any value in hearing what the other side has to say," says producer Rob Montz in USA Today. "What is new: administrators who bend to their will." At his own alma mater, Brown, "students have sabotaged a lecture from [former] NYC police chief Ray Kelly . . . and set up a puppy-equipped safe space to escape a debate about rape culture." But officials "refuse to see this censoring species of activism . . . as a threat at all." Which is why students and alumni "are desperate for the university to stand up firmly for open inquiry, to stand up firmly for itself."    The recent WikiLeaks disclosure of Hillary Clinton's 2013 speech to Brazilian investors in which she cited "her dream of an America without borders" puzzles Chicago Tribune columnist John Kass: "If you don't have borders, you don't have a country. Americans are beginning to understand this. Europeans understand it now quite clearly." She also wants "a hemispheric common market" - much like the European Union, which is "dissolving in chaos, fear and debt." Warns Kass: "If that is indeed her dream," it's one "that would end America." Why isn't this a issue? "There is no video involving sex and Hollywood and Trump," so "the Clinton campaign isn't commenting. And reporters aren't really pressing."     Many OPEC nations "are now near political and economic collapse, or have drastically cut social programs while running giant deficits in order to hold the rock bottom prices" caused by their own production glut aimed at killing the US fracking industry, notes Kevin Cochrane in The Weekly Standard. But, he says, they won't be the biggest winners now that the Saudis are cutting production. "It's actually China . . . that stands to gain the most," even though it "imports about half of all of its oil." Why? "China built enormous storage capacity, which is now brimming with cheap Russian crude" and the Chinese "were also dramatically increasing their refining capacity." Plus, "the Russians agreed in return to buy refined gasoline back from China at prices tied to the world price for oil." So Beijing is now set to cash in.    President Obama has just re-upped his call for "sending humans to Mars by the 2030s." But his real legacy, says The Washington Post's Christian Davenport, is "the standing up of a commercial space industry that has ended the government's monopoly on space." When the shuttle program ended in 2011, "NASA looked to the commercial sector to fly its astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, fertilizing the industry with billions of dollars in contracts. And . . . the industry has begun to blossom." But "there is still no self-sustaining economy to keep commercial space companies alive, many of which would wither without the support of NASA or the billionaires that are funding them with their own money."  
November 22, 2016	 The New York Post	  The New Yorkers who traveled to Shanghai last week for the Real Deal magazine's annual showcase were supposed to talk about investment opportunities in US real estate - but ended up reassuring each other that property values will be going up with the election of Donald Trump.      "It was supposed to be about real estate and the EB-5 program [which grants American permanent resident status to foreigners who invest $500,000 and create jobs], but it turned into a Trumpathon," one attendee told me.     "Relax, take a deep breath. The United States is still the United States," former Gov. George Pataki (left) said, addressing concerns that Trump's presidency will hurt US-China relations.    Developer Don Peebles, a potential mayoral candidate, said, "We are better because of immigration. We are better because of foreign capital."     If Trump goes too far, Peebles said, "The US Congress will put the brakes on him. One man, and one man with a big mouth, does not change our values."     HFZ Capital Group's Ziel Feldman said, "The reality is that our president-elect's platform is absolutely pro-business and anti-regulation."  
January 19, 2017	 The New York Post	  Even before taking office, Donald Trump has been good at bullying companies into keeping jobs in the US. That will win praise from voters, including me.     He has, essentially, abolished the Mexican part of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, by making US companies too afraid to move south of the border.     But the president-elect has also shown a total lack of understanding about world trade issues and how his domestic policies - and even his tweets - will affect the economy.     In fact, I confronted him about the trade wars he might be causing when we met last summer. He just shrugged it off.    Other presidents have picked fights with China, mostly about its human rights policies. China ignored them.     But Trump found the right nerve when he started talking directly with Taiwan. China doesn't want the island to be recognized, so Trump's decision to ignore the so-called "one China" policy has been shaking up Beijing.    What our new president doesn't seem to understand is that China is not only a big market for a lot of US companies but also a key partner for Washington.    China owns around $1.3 trillion of America's nearly $20 trillion in debt. Without China's money, the US Treasury will have trouble funding its deficits.     If China wanted to make trouble, it could send US interest rates sharply higher and throw our economy into a tailspin.    Hillary Clinton has just a few hours left to secure a pardon from President Obama. After that she takes her chances with whatever the mercurial Trump has in store for her.     Obama has pardoned or commuted the sentences of more than 1,000 people - in fact, he's the most forgiving president in history. And while Hillary has until noon on Friday to get a pardon for any crimes she may have committed, Obama as of noon on Wednesday does not intend to pardon Madame Secretary.     One reason: He probably doesn't like her very much. The two were opponents for the White House in 2008 and harsh words were exchanged. And her appointment as secretary of state was more of a business transaction than anything else.    And, as you can probably figure out yourself, Obama likely doesn't want his legacy eroded any more than it already has been and will be as Trump undoes his actions.     Plus, Hillary's recklessness with her e-mails could have put Obama personally in an embarrassing situation. Months ago, I explained that Hillary needed permission from the White House to use her beloved BlackBerry inside the State Department, even though that ran afoul of security protocol.     But the best reason for not giving a pardon is simple: Obama doesn't really know what kind of trouble Hillary might be in. And she would have to admit to things she might not be ready to reveal to get completely out of trouble.    On top of that, if Obama pardoned her, how would others feel who might be equally jammed up because of her possible wrongdoing? There are long lists of people who had to be complicit if crimes were committed.   Trump has said he would not appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary. The Clintons have been through enough, he said.    But that doesn't really matter. In fact, a special prosecutor would have to start from the beginning and that would slow things down.    l    the one involving the laptop of Hillary's longtime aide Huma Abedin.

Should a person in rags who steals from a department store be treated more harshly than a shoplifter with a tiara?    Hillary Clinton's chance for a pardon ends Friday at noon. And with the way her supporters behaved after she lost the election, I doubt that Donald Trump is going to feel very compassionate.  
December 17, 2016	 The New York Post	  President Obama claimed Friday that he went mano-a-mano with Vladimir Putin over Russia's meddling in the US election, telling the strongman to "cut it out" and warning of "serious consequences" if he didn't.    "In early September, when I saw President Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that [meddling] didn't happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be serious consequences if he didn't," Obama said in full John Wayne mode.     But a cascade of leaked e-mails swiped from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton aide John Podesta continued to flow from WikiLeaks right up to Election Day - so it's unclear what effect Obama's comments to Putin accomplished.    "My principal goal leading up to the election was making sure that the election itself went off without a hitch," he said, adding that he accomplished that goal.    "Clearly Putin was not impressed by Obama threat in September to cut it out or face consequences," Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) tweeted.    Tony Shaffer, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who exposed intelligence failures before 9/11, dismissed Obama's talk as "vapor."    Obama indicated Putin knew about the e-mail hackings, noting the Kremlin does little without the leader's approval.    "Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin. The Russians were responsible for hacking the DNC," he said during the year-end news conference.     Donald Trump has dismissed talk of Russian hacking as "ridiculous" despite the intelligence community's near consensus that it occurred.     In his remarks Friday, Obama took a harder a line with Russia than he did when the country invaded Crimea, shot down a civilian passenger jet, hacked the White House and bombed Syrian civilians in alliance with the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.    "The Russians can't change us or significantly weaken us. They are a smaller country, they are a weaker country, their economy doesn't produce anything that anybody wants to buy except oil and gas and arms," he said.     He said he felt "responsible" for the suffering in Syria but defended his decision to avoid serious military action there, saying it was "impossible to do this on the cheap."    "This blood and these atrocities are on their hands," he said shortly before leaving on his annual Christmas vacation to Hawaii.    Obama weighed in on Trump's decision to speak with the leader of Taiwan, a phone call that broke decades of US diplomatic protocol.    He advised Trump to "think it through" before altering the US policy of recognizing Taiwan as part of China.  With Post Wire Services

October 23, 2016	 The New York Post	  Abe LINCOLN'S legacy is safe, and not just because Donald Trump talked too long Saturday. It's that he said too little that was new or uplifting.     Running out of time to change the campaign's dynamics, Trump's team picked Gettysburg for a speech it touted as a possible turning point in the presidential race, just as the 1863 battle there had turned the Civil War.     But the candidate seemed to have other ideas about the proposition at hand. The result was a mash-up of conflicting themes instead of a clarion call to arms.      Part complaint, part appeal to better angels, part a contract with voters and part a list of things to do, the speech never gelled into a coherent vision. By trying to do too many things, it didn't do any well.     After starting with a perfunctory reference to Lincoln's address, and to his own status as a political outsider, Trump dedicated 10 precious minutes to a sour restatement of grievances against a "rigged system."     The usual suspects - a dishonest media, voter fraud, Hillary Clinton's corruption, a crooked FBI and the "liars" who accused him of groping - were soundly thrashed. The women who lied will be sued, he promised, and giant media mergers would be broken up, too.     It was a stale, dark opening that clouded the 20 minutes of solid policy promises that followed. As such, the reset needs a reset.     The problem is not just dwindling time, but also a shrinking pool of persuadable voters. National polls consistently show he is stuck at about 40 percent, and that many white, suburban women who usually vote Republican are not with him.     If Trump was talking directly to them, I missed it. As is often the case, he focused on feeding red meat to his core supporters instead of adding to them with a broader appeal.     After his grievances, he switched gears by saying, "Here is why this is relevant to you," meaning voters, citing jobs, health care and home ownership.     At that point, he seemed to be going in a circle. But after vowing to "drain the swamp of Washington," he finally hit on the theme his team had touted as the purpose.    He started with a new tone, asking voters to "rise above the noise and clutter," embrace the "faith and optimism that have always been the central ingredient" of America and "dream big again."    The words were right, and he read them properly off the teleprompter, but there wasn't much passion. It had echoes of a presidential address, but not the heart, and he too quickly moved to the programmatic "contract" he was committing to.     They included a hiring freeze, regulation curbs, tax cuts, a wall, congressional term limits, new trade deals, labeling China a currency manipulator, nominating a conservative judge to the Supreme Court and too many others to count or remember.     None was new, but the point was the packaging to replicate the "Contract with America" that Newt Gingrich used to win the House in 1994.     That was a long time ago, when America was hungry for change from President Bill Clinton's first two years and his decision to let Hillary Clinton remake health care.    Now Trump, advised by Gingrich in another election about change, is trying to follow a similar path to keep Hillary from getting back to the White House.     The choice of Gettysburg underscores the lessons of history, but one of them is that Lincoln's magnificent address initially was panned as inadequate. Trump doesn't have the luxury of time, so he must hope that what he said there was not in vain. 
November 7, 2016	 The New York Post	  The mainstream media has tossed aside all pretense of objectivity to beat Donald Trump, writes former NPR CEO Ken Stern at Vanity Fair. And even if you buy the justification that Trump is a unique threat to America, he says, we should all be concerned about the media's ability to unring this bell. "Attitude changes like these have a way of normalizing very quickly. I can easily imagine, for instance, a similar response from the mainstream media if Mike Huckabee or Ted Cruz, or some other similarly non-traditional candidate were to secure the nomination of the Republican Party for President in 2020. Having helped successfully scuttle the nomination of one candidate, it may be terribly tempting for our leading organizations and media outlets to seek an encore performance."    The argument over whether charter schools "work" misses a key point, writes David Leonhardt in The New York Times. And that is the fact that one type of charter school "has repeatedly shown impressive results." It's what is known as a "high expectations, high support" educational model: "They devote more of their resources to classroom teaching and less to almost everything else. They keep students in class for more hours. They set high standards for students and try to instill confidence in them. They focus on giving teachers feedback about their craft and helping them get better." Leonhardt notes that these schools help poor and minority children catch up with wealthier white kids. So why aren't there more of them? Leonhardt explains the "messy" politics of education - which, first and foremost, means those with a vested interest in traditional schools, like teachers unions and their political champions, oppose them.    Donald Trump's fame has enabled him to run for president without spending a huge chunk of his personal fortune, writes Jim Antle at the Washington Examiner. So, will other celebrities follow suit? "In April, George Clooney raised $15 million in two high-dollar fundraisers for Hillary Clinton. A seat at the head table with Clinton and the Clooneys reportedly went for $353,400. Jane Fonda and Ellen DeGeneres were on hand as attendees dined on Chilean sea bass and prawn risotto." Yet the irony is that "it's Republican celebrities who have been most likely to win elected office" - Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sonny Bono, Fred Thompson, Ronald Reagan. Politics can be bad for a celebrity's brand, Antle warns. "But Trump has undeniably shown how far an ego and an audience can get you in politics."    Republicans should admit Donald Trump got a few things right, counsels Danielle Pletka in The Washington Post. He understood that our "feckless" fight against ISIS projects weakness. And on trade: "The truth is that deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership have been oversold - not because their benefits don't vastly outweigh their costs, but because the pro-trade side fails to acknowledge that some workers truly end up displaced. The guy who loses his job when his factory decamps to China can be forgiven for thinking elites are full of it when they intone on the universal benefits of free trade." Pletka advises: "It's not that Americans don't want to engage with the world, it's that they want to engage successfully."    Remember the IRS scandal over the agency targeting conservative nonprofits? Well, it's still happening, writes Rick Moran at PJ Media: "A federal judge in Ohio has had it with the IRS foot-dragging on applications from conservative organizations for exempt status and has ordered the agency to quit stalling." The order, contained in a filing unsealed Friday, makes clear that "three years after being assured by the IRS that they had stopped singling out conservative organizations for special scrutiny, the targeting continues," Moran says. It also shows the IRS' utter contempt for the investigation, according to Moran. The targeting will continue, Moran says, "until a judge holds a couple of IRS managers in contempt and lets them cool their heels in jail for a few days."  
December 12, 2016	 The New York Post	  WASHINGTON - Donald Trump on Sunday dismissed CIA reports that Russia intervened in the election to propel him to the White House as "ridiculous" and blamed Democrats for peddling the theory as an "excuse" for losing.      "I think it's ridiculous. I think it's just another excuse," Trump told "Fox News Sunday." "Every week, it's another excuse."    The Washington Post reported that the CIA had determined that Russia intervened in the elections against Hillary Clinton by turning over thousands of hacked e-mails from the Democratic National Committee and from her campaign chairman, John Podesta, to WikiLeaks.    Despite US intelligence reports pointing the finger at Moscow, Trump continued to dispute claims that Russia had anything to do with the hacks.     Russia could be behind the interference, but "I don't think it is," Trump said, adding it could be China or "somebody sitting in a bed someplace."    "I think the Democrats are putting it out because they suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country," Trump said.  
December 18, 2016	 The New York Post	  So this is how it ends - in a whimper wrapped in self-pity and recriminations. With President Obama on the defensive at his final press conference and Hillary Clinton's last campaign event resembling a wake, the Democratic Party is limping off the stage and into the political winter.     It was supposed to sit atop the national power pyramid for decades, a new paradigm of liberals, progressives, the young, the old, the unions and blacks, Latinos, Muslims and Asians.      The torch would be passed from Obama to Clinton, a liberal Supreme Court would vastly expand executive power and the regulatory state would enforce climate-change orthodoxy on all industry and elitist dictates on every American. Globalism would be the new patriotism.    But a funny thing happened on the way to one-party dominance: The people who work for a living said no, hell no. Their revolt brings Donald Trump to the White House amid hopes of a revival of the economy and of the American spirit.     Thoroughly beaten, the Dems are at their lowest point in nearly a century. From the White House to Congress to statehouses, they are on the outside looking in.     Their punishment was well-deserved, as demonstrated by Obama and Clinton. Full of excuses and blaming everyone except themselves, their closing acts proved it is time for them to go.    They have nothing new to offer, with their vision of the future limited to larger doses of the same failing medicine and their intolerance for disagreement showing they would never learn from their mistakes. Their bad ideas had run their disastrous course.     Yet instead of analyzing what went wrong and trying to find new organizing principles, party leaders and activists are pointing fingers at the FBI and Russia, and engaging in a mad bid to overturn Trump's Electoral College victory.     Because they are doomed to fail, we could be witnessing the death throes of the Democratic Party as we know it. With Obama and the Clintons encouraging the attempted theft of an election they lost and failing to denounce intimidation and death threats against Trump electoral voters, most Americans have reason to consider the Dems a dead letter.     Yet the final verdict on 2016 depends on Trump's performance as president. If he delivers "jobs, jobs, jobs" and peace-through-strength abroad, he will forge a new governing consensus and remake the political landscape.     While it's too soon to know what exactly Trumpism stands for, it's clear that many Republican orthodoxies and special-interest debts are being tossed overboard. His Cabinet nominees are incredibly accomplished individuals who come to their new jobs without the burdens of past Washington gridlock. If he can attract centrist-minded Dems, some of whom he is courting, Trump has a chance to build a pragmatic coalition that keeps faith with mainstream America.     The obstacles, of course, are many. Much of the Islamic world is on fire and the great powers are moving ever closer to confrontation in Europe and Asia.     Obama leaves office with Russia, Iran and China eating our lunch, with the Chinese theft of a Navy drone a goodbye insult. The unspeakable horror of Syria and the rise of Islamic State will forever be part of the 44th president's legacy.    So, too, will be domestic divisions, which grew more stark and bitter in the last eight years. We are now perilously close to a boil, and that, too, falls partially on Obama's shoulders given his fear-mongering about Trump.    Against that dark reality, it is reasonable to worry the nation is on the verge of a crack-up. But there is also a possibility that America is on the verge of a new greatness.     It's up to Trump. The ultimate outsider and a historic disrupter, he bears some responsibility for the polarization. But victory presents him with an opportunity to make government work for the people, instead of the other way around.     He is off to a great start and must stay focused to avoid falling down the rabbit holes of petty disputes. America needs the change he promised and he needs to commit every ounce of his being into keeping that promise. If he succeeds, so will the nation. 
February 17, 2016	 The New York Post	  People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sent Trump a letter on Tuesday saying it was "shocked" to discover a beanie hat with "real rabbit fur" was found in her Ivanka Trump line since "most of the fur you use in your collection is faux."      Its findings have resulted in 110 retailers, including H&M, Tommy Hilfiger and Forever 21, pledging to stop selling angora products, PETA claims.     Last year, the group launched a campaign against Free People, owned by Urban Outfitters, for selling angora products; and after initially rebuffing PETA, Free People said it would stop using angora. 
April 28, 2016	 The New York Post	  Donald Trump's foreign-policy remarks Wednesday will serve him well with voters: He offered a clear critique of what the nation's been doing wrong, and promised a new "coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies."     His "America First" approach is a clear contrast with Hillary Clinton - who embraces the foreign-policy establishment that Trump faults for failing the country.    He started by identifying the key problems: Too few resources, with a weakened military and a weakened US economy. Allies who aren't stepping up - in part because they no longer trust Washington to have their backs. Enemies who don't fear us, and rivals who don't respect us.    Above all, "America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign-policy goals." And we haven't since the end of the Cold War.    Along the way, he slammed the Obama-Clinton record of "weakness, confusion and disarray" - while also disavowing the interventionism and naïve nation-building efforts of the Bush years.    He de facto embraced the one aspect of Obama's policy the public likes: "I will not send our finest into battle unless necessary - and I mean absolutely necessary."     Again, the contrast with Clinton is obvious: She's always been more hawkish than Obama; it's one reason he beat her in 2008. She pushed for the Libya war, and for intervention in Syria that Obama rejected.    Yet Trump will fight "when there is no alternative - but when America fights, it must only fight to win."    This isn't isolationism, but a longstanding US tradition that runs from the (Colin) Powell Doctrine all the way to Andrew Jackson.    In the same spirit, and also in stark contrast to Clinton, Trump repudiated mindless internationalism: Enough with agreements that limit the nation's "ability to control our own affairs."     He wants "a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam" and promises ISIS's "days are numbered."     He'll rebuild the US military and US economy, try for realistic understandings with rivals like Russia and China - and refocus US alliances in Europe and Asia for the challenges of today.     "We must make America respected again. We must make America truly wealthy again. And we must, we have to and we will make America great again," he summed up.     "And if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever known." 
November 13, 2016	 The New York Post	  Barack Obama's foreign-policy legacy includes reduced American global influence, dramatically underfunded military and intelligence capabilities, and rising concern among longtime allies about Washington's understanding of international threats. A world of nuclear-weapons proliferation and growing radical Islamic terrorism are the consequences.    During his White House tenure, Obama regarded national-security policy as a distraction. He preferred instead to concentrate on what he said candidly in 2008 was his main objective: to "fundamentally transform" America. International crises constantly threatened to divert time and energy away from that ideological quest.    This is not to say that Obama did not have his own distinct - and badly misguided - worldview. In Obama's opinion, and that of all of his top advisors, most definitely including Hillary Clinton, America's global presence, its strength and assertiveness and its manifest success in protecting its allies and its interests actually contribute to tension, instability and outright conflict.    Under this worldview, American efforts at self-defense and mutual security are part of the problem, not the solution.    Nowhere is the spreading global chaos more apparent than in the Middle East, and it is here that President-elect Donald Trump will face his most immediate international challenges.    In August 1914, British Foreign Minister Edward Grey observed that "the lamps are going out all over Europe, we shall not see them lit again in our life-time." We are not far wrong to ask whether Grey's insight applies today in the Middle East:    Radical Islam has spread across the region, shattering governments and leaving anarchy where terrorist groups, warlords and brigands are taking root.    Post-World War I boundaries are disappearing. ISIS has declared a caliphate in what used to be Syria and Iraq.    Turkey is turning away from its secular constitution toward President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's own concept of a caliphate.    Worst of all, Iran is now on a path to deliverable nuclear weapons, legitimized by Obama's wretched deal, which is providing untold economic benefits to Tehran through unfrozen assets and renewed trade and investment, especially from Europe. Iran's support for terrorism continues unabated, and its provocative international behavior has only worsened since the nuclear deal. Russia's influence in the region is higher than at any time since the 1970s.    President-elect Trump has been emphatic that destroying ISIS must be an urgent priority, not Obama's slow-motion approach that has simply allowed ISIS to continue recruiting adherents and training and deploying terrorists throughout the West. In addition, however, a Trump anti-ISIS strategy must also correct Obama's misguided reliance on the Baghdad government, which has become little more than an Iranian puppet.    In this complex multi-sided war, the defeat of any combatant inevitably advantages all the others. The goal should be to destroy ISIS while benefiting Iran to the least extent possible.    Sunni Arabs who previously supported ISIS (or accepted it because they could not resist) will not again be quietly relegated to the tender mercies of an Iran-dominated Iraqi government or Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria.    Either a new state must be created out of the wreckage of Syria and Iraq, or some other durable approach must be found. Moreover, the new Russian airbase in Latakia, Syria, has dramatically changed the strategic environment in the eastern Mediterranean and beyond.    Unfortunately, the base cannot be made to disappear simply by reversing Obama's erroneous policies.    In the midst of this wasteland that has developed over the past eight years, Israel and America's Arab friends are desperately waiting for a strong American president who understands who his friends are. President-elect Trump can change the regional political dynamic quickly, signaling that US elections do truly have consequences.    One key step would be to abrogate the Iran nuclear deal in his first days in office. There will be considerable diplomacy required to explain this courageous but necessary decision, but the unambiguous signal it would send worldwide cannot be underestimated.    While terrorism and Middle East anarchy could fill any President's day, it is critical the incoming Trump administration also fashion strategies to deal with longer-term issues like protecting America's constitutional system from the advocates of global governance and the realities of international competition from the likes of China and Russia.    Failing to engage in strategic thinking at the outset of any new Administration risks exacerbating the problems that will inevitably flow during its four or eight years in office. Doing the hard preparatory work now will pay off when the uncertain future becomes all too real.    Mr. Bolton is former US ambassador to the United Nations (2005-2006).

December 22, 2016	 The New York Post	  Bill and Hillary Clinton "are the people responsible for turning the Democratic party into the party of Wall Street and their glitzy friends" going back 25 years, writes Jill Abramson in The Guardian. She recalls covering Bill in 1991 "at one of his early Hollywood shakedowns . . . He loved schmoozing with rich people, [and] his body language literally changed as he mixed with the ultra-rich." That same crowd - "fundamentally at odds with the party's egalitarian message" - expected "their $1.2 billion infusion to catapult Hillary Clinton back into the White House and were astonished, like the rest of the country's elite, to see all that money go down the tubes."    Former Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Utah ex-Gov. Jon Huntsman (R), writing at Real Clear Politics, say calls for change won't be realized if we see "compromise as a sin, pragmatism as a character flaw and common ground as a foreign country." Those who "promise good times forever if we only agree with 100 percent of their ideas 100 percent of the time" will only produce "gridlock, not progress." With more voters "starting to identify as moderate and independent," there's a new center "that in Washington seems drowned out by the left and right but is larger than either of them." Behaving as "one people with differences of opinion" who are "willing to compromise" will "make America great again. In fact, that's how America became great in the first place."    Donald Trump isn't even president and he's already wandered into two foreign-policy crises, warns David Ignatius in The Washington Post. "His freewheeling style seems to have discombobulated China, which has some unexpected benefits. But on Russia, Trump is on his back foot." He "created some useful ambiguity" by "daring to raise the unmentionable topic of Taiwan" and "the Chinese aren't used to such ambiguity" from Washington. Senior US officials suggest Trump's "disregard for precedent . . . reckless as it may appear, may open up possibilities for US diplomacy," especially after "eight years of prudent and predictable" Obama policy. But "this is a high-risk strategy, which may create consternation among allies even as it enhances deterrence of adversaries."    Donald Trump is promising to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and, unlike previous presidents, "looks like he's going to keep his word," notes Eli Lake at Bloomberg. But while this "would help discredit those who seek to delegitimize Israel . . . it is nonetheless just a symbol." Some fear a risk to "Israel's quiet relationships in the region" with Arab states and "violent protests" in neighboring Arab countries. One Israeli diplomat warns: "It will overshadow the increasing cooperation on the security side, and it will make it harder to come out of the closet with this cooperation, which is in Israel's interest."    The families of three men killed in the Orlando nightclub by jihadist Omar Mateen are suing Facebook and Alphabet (Google and YouTube), claiming they "did not do enough to keep the Islamic State and sundry Muslim radicals from using their platforms to recruit and inspire such acts of savagery." This, says Kevin Williamson at National Review, because "the nerds who run Facebook and Google have billions of dollars at their disposal, no sovereign immunity and no proclivity for cutting off the heads of those who oppose them." But "good luck collecting on a judgment" against ISIS or Iran. "Lightening Mark Zuckerberg's wallet is not going to do very much to improve that," however, and "might create a precedent that would damage free speech and free enterprise." - Compiled by Eric Fettmann 
July 24, 2016	 The New York Post	  CLEVELAND - Strange and terrible things can happen at these supposedly "too-scripted" "glorified infomercials" we call political conventions. Backstage in 2012 at the Republican convention in Tampa, none of the party apparatchiks had any idea what Clint Eastwood would say when he politely requested a 15-minute slot that had been reserved for others. Great, said Republican handlers. Then Eastwood requested a chair. Er, okaaaaay, said the RNC suits.    Then Eastwood began talking to the chair. On stage. In front of tens of millions of voters. Backstage, according to journalists who were there, a leading RNC official leaned over and vomited into a garbage can.    But conventions can spur spontaneous magic, too. Sarah Palin was a completely unknown quantity when her speech instantly defibrillated the clogged arteries of John McCain's tired campaign on Sept. 3, 2008. Four years ago in Charlotte, Joe Biden veered off the teleprompter and started riffing. Far from coming across as an ill-timed dose of Crazy Uncle Joe, though, it worked beautifully and helped make for a winning convention.     Here in Cleveland, at the Huntington Convention Center where thousands of political journos were holed up a half-mile from "the Q" - the Quicken Loans Arena where the speakers thundered and the delegates herded - the hacks took turns Monday morning gazing down at the urban farm located right on the property. Just outside what figured to be the most fractious party convention in at least 40 years, 700,000 bees were swarming. Immediately the Hall of Hacks shifted into a state of Advanced Metaphor Alert. Bees can come together to make sweet, irresistible honey. Or they can just go bonkers stinging everyone in sight.    What would the Republicans create? Painful, long-lasting welts or a delicious treat so smooth you can spread it on toast?     According to an NBC News poll, Donald Trump was only 1 point behind Hillary Clinton as the convention kicked off. But as things got rolling Monday, the Fifth Avenue insurgent was facing a conservative counter-insurgency: having failed to drive through a Rules Committee change that would have allowed Trump's delegates to vote for someone other than Trump, last-ditchers joined a rebellion led by Utah Sen. Mike Lee to force a roll-call vote, instead of a voice vote, that would have at least forced everyone present to go on the record with their position on Trump.     "Chaos!" said NBC News. "Chaos!" said NPR. "Open discord and rebellion!" said CNN. But the whole thing was over in a few minutes. This wasn't a prison riot, it was grumbling. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, like an exceedingly polite and buttoned-down bulldozer, blithely eliminated the opposition and pushed on. A day later, all that was left of the #NeverTrump vanquished was . . . a cocktail party. Influential anti-Trump conservative journos - nationally known columnists, leading magazine editors - listened as officers of the group Better for America promised improbably that they could whip up a complete national political campaign in "a matter of days" and that prominent financial backers sitting on the bench were eager to charge on the field for . . . a third- or fourth- or fifth-party candidate. We nodded and sipped our rosé and nibbled our shrimp cocktail but the Dump Trump movement was dead without knowing it. It was like the ghost ball in "The Shining."     Back at the Q there was no doubt about whose party this was. Monday night featured one blistering speech after another, most of them attacking Hillary Clinton as a dishonest, untrustworthy, corrupt and failed leader. Just a day after a cop hater gunned down three police officers in Baton Rouge, just four days after an ISIS-loving fanatic ran down some 300 people with a truck in Nice, just 11 days after another radical killed five cops in Dallas, just 36 days after another Islamist freak murdered 49 people at an Orlando disco, fear of real, actual, blood-in-the-streets chaos was on the minds of every American except Democratic Party fanboys lost in their own fog of denial. They keep nervously reassuring one another that the Summer of Terror isn't.     'The vast majority of Americans today do not feel safe," said ex-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani in a barnburner of a speech. "They fear for their children. They fear for themselves. They fear for our police officers, who are being targeted." He praised the police in the hall and outside it, crying, with genuine plaintive gratitude, "When they come to save your life, they don't ask if you are black or white. They just come to save you!" He referred to the stark and utterly undeniable poisoning of race relations under President Obama and asked, "What happened - what happened to 'There's no black America, there's no white America, there is just America?' What happened to it? Where did it go?"    Liberals - both the admitted kind and the pretend neutrals who work at "unbiased" major media outlets - had been quietly dismissive of the evening so far, as one speaker after another failed to find his footing, spoke too long or allowed their rhetoric to get ahead of the facts. Plus: What was Scott Baio doing here? But now Giuliani was raining haymakers on Obama-Clintonism. The mewling, apologetic, America-last mindset about how we must try to "empathize with" (as Mrs. Clinton once put it) underprivileged peoples who just happen to be mass murderers was being confronted forthrightly. The HRC-BHO outlook was getting skewered, filleted and barbecued.    Liberals were getting nervous. First they got on social media and called Giuliani crazy. Then they went quiet, realizing it was counterproductive to draw attention to what he'd said. Their best bet was to hope that some other jingling cat toy would roll along the carpet for America to bat around.     When Melania's pretty but content-free speech was revealed to have recycled about three sentences' worth of vapid sentiment from Michelle Obama's 2008 speech in Denver, it triggered a hysteria avalanche, a rockslide of mockery with a tinge of concern-trolling about What This Meant about the professionalism of the Trump campaign.     The train wreck the media had pre-scripted was well under way. But Donald J. Trump has been outsmarting the media since Day 1. He lowered expectations so brilliantly that it would seem like a miracle if the Trump Train even stayed on the tracks. It did much more than that. It began to pick up steam. It began flattening everything in its path. By the end of the convention, it was looking hard to stop.     Halfway through the week, the media had already decided this would go in the books as the Plagiarism and Scott Baio Convention. The turn came when Trump and his campaign supremo Paul Manafort, who had been dickering behind the scenes with Ted Cruz about the Texas senator's much-awaited Wednesday night speech, managed to turn Ted's dislike to its advantage.     Manafort couldn't convince Cruz to give an endorsement, but he knew exactly what Cruz was going to say. We all did. The entire transcript was sent out to the media before Cruz started speaking. There would be only one mention of Trump, and it would be as frosty as the maniacal air conditioning that chilled the Q. "I want to congratulate Donald Trump on winning the nomination last night" was as far as Cruz would go. So Manafort and Co. decided, before the speech even started, that it would end with heckling. (Time magazine and other sources reported as much, citing anonymous sources. Manafort evidently tipped off Bloomberg reporter Mark Halperin, who tweeted before the speech, "@PaulManafort owns the floor. Will be key at several moments tonight. Watch what @tedcruz says & the reaction.")    Cruz approached the end and, as Cruz's campaign manager Jeff Roe said on a Philadelphia radio show, the "active whip operation got active." The New York delegates were whipped up by Team Trump to interrupt Cruz with shouts of "We want Trump," finally booing him off the stage. Cruz, in portraying himself as the man of principle, looked like a louse on a skunk.     It was a genius move by Manafort that pulled off three astonishing tricks. For the media, which thinks of itself as a relentless detective agency discovering for the people's benefit the "unscripted moments" that reveal everything, it gave them a perfectly crafted scene they over-hyped because they didn't know it was staged.    For the public, it gave them a new and irresistible reason to watch Trump's speech the following night. And for Trump, it made him, for once, the innocent wronged victim instead of the bully - in the parlance of the pro-wrestling shows that Trump used to participate in, the "heel" had become the "face." That certified smartypants Cruz essentially blew himself up on live TV was for Manafort and Trump merely an amusing side benefit.    Now the Trump Train was hitting about 90 mph. After an endearing set-up speech by Ivanka Trump, who softened her dad's rough edges by recalling all the times she'd seen him invite luckless souls into his office to hook them up with jobs or contacts, the Q was practically vibrating in anticipation. His speech was powerful stuff that looked straight into the eyes of the 69 percent of Americans who think the country is on the wrong track and said, "I understand." Trump is a salesman and he knows what product he's selling. He also knows who hasn't been buying: a lot of college-educated GOP voters turned off by his hyperbole. So he skillfully played to them without sounding like he was abandoning Trumpismo. Combined with his running mate Mike Pence's soothing remarks the previous night, the message was reassuring for an important bloc of voters: Trump signalled it was safe for Republicans to come home and open their checkbooks.     OK, he isn't running for sheriff. And a president doesn't have the power to command the world to calm itself and take a time-out. But the presidency - like salesmanship - is all about gauging the emotional state of the country and matching it. In 2012, Americans said their No. 1 issue was the economy, and they said they trusted Mitt Romney to handle it better. But President Obama trounced Romney on the much fuzzier question of "Does he care about people like me?"     This year, the "I feel your pain" candidate isn't a Clinton. Trump painted a picture of a moment plagued by cop killings, terrorist attacks, mayhem and injustice. It happens to be the exact same picture painted grudgingly by the journalists who despise him. "I am the law and order candidate," he declared, and who doubts that? Plus voters remain more inclined to trust a successful businessman over a career lawyer/politico when it comes to economic stewardship.     The media groused about how Trump was supposedly too loud, or too nasty, or went on too long - but the public didn't care. The public, like Trump, is tired of political correctness and saw him as the lone gunslinger who was willing to take aim at the bad guys. The speech wasn't just a success, it was a smash hit - 75 percent favorability, according to a CNN snap poll, with 56 percent saying they were now more likely to vote Trump as against only 10 percent less likely.     Loony fire-and-brimstone stuff? Hardly. Trump said nothing that was outrageous, racist or sexist. Is that a low bar? Yep, but the media set it at ankle height, then was shocked when Trump hopped over it. Gone was the suggestion that Mexico be made to pay for the wall on the border, which he mentioned only briefly. Gone was the promise that all Muslim immigration would be halted.     Instead of threatening a trade war with China, he spoke of turning "our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements." When the crowd reacted to a mention of Hillary Clinton by chanting, "Lock her up!" he waved them off. Trump no longer has to play the rabble-rouser. Now he's serious, and he looks it. The protest candidate has gone mainstream. The barking dog caught the car he was chasing, climbed in, and started driving. The media expected open-mic night at a ninth-rate comedy club; he gave them a plausible potential president.  
January 14, 2017	 The New York Post	  The chairmen of the Senate Intelligence Committee said late Friday that they will launch a probe into communications between Russia and members of the incoming Trump administration.      GOP Sen. Richard Burr and Democrat Mark Warner said the inquiry into suspected Russian ties to the Trump campaign will be part of a broader investigation into Moscow's meddling in the 2016 election.     Last week, an intelligence report was released that said Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered a hacking campaign to help Donald Trump win.    Meanwhile, Trump aide Michael Flynn reportedly spoke to Russia's US ambassador multiple times on the day the Obama administration hit Moscow with sanctions to retaliate for its alleged hacking.     Also, Trump told The Wall Street Journal that he would consider dropping sanctions against Russia if they help us and do "some really great things." He also refused to commit to the longstanding "one China" policy because of trade issues.  
January 24, 2017	 The New York Post	   President Trump wasted no time Monday carrying out a central campaign pledge by scuttling the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.     "We've been talking about this for a long time," Trump said as he signed the order (above) in the Oval Office. "Great thing for the American worker."    The trade agreement among 12 Pacific Rim nations became a major issue in the 2016 presidential campaign, with even Hillary Clinton renouncing the deal she had previously supported.    "Now is the time to develop a trade policy that helps working families, not just multinational corporations," he said.    But Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) condemned Trump's action, saying it increases China's influence in the region.    "President Trump's decision . . . is a serious mistake that will have lasting consequences for America's economy and our strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region," he said.    The TPP was negotiated by President Barack Obama but never adopted by Congress. It was aimed at lifting most tariffs and other trade barriers among the US, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Australia and Vietnam, among other countries. 
May 31, 2016	 The New York Post	  Meet Donald the pheasant (left) - a bird with the best, most amazing, most tremendous golden-orange crest atop its head. And, yes, it's real.     "Someone called and said that Donald Trump was in their back yard and could someone from Animal Care and Control come pick him up - especially because they are Democrats," said ACC spokeswoman Katy Hansen.    What it was doing in Queens April 7 remains a mystery. ACC officials said that they could not disclose where they picked up Donald, only that they took him to the Wild Bird Fund, an avian hospital and rehab center on the Upper West Side.    "He likes strutting around the place," said Rita McMahon, the center's executive director. "He's quite the man about town. He is very interested in the other female birds here - even though they're not his species."     "He actually tries to mount some of the ducks. There's one in particular named Siena. And she's not opposed to it!"    McMahon suspects the yard-long bird was ordered online by folks who probably did not have a permit - or any idea how far it could fly. 
August 12, 2016	 The New York Post	  Gov. Cuomo questioned the safety of food grown in China Thursday as he promoted a program to certify farm produce grown in New York state.     "Food safety is knowing what we eat and where it came from and how it was handled," he said. "The lack of knowledge is frightening."    The governor added that food labeled "organic" and sold in the United States might originate from polluted soil in China.    "Organic from China - you don't really know how these products were grown," he said during a press conference at the Hunts Point wholesale ­market in The Bronx.    The governor announced regulations to more clearly define, label and regulate food from state farms to boost sales. He also announced plans to modernize and expand Hunts Point, moves he said will create 150 construction jobs. 
April 21, 2016	 The New York Post	  Unless something extraordinary happens, the presidential election will pit Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton. That much became clearer on Tuesday when New Yorkers voted overwhelmingly for the two - putting them just one election from the White House.    The other thing that has become crystal-clear these past few months is that this election is all about the economy - "money" is a better way to put it. (National elections are always about the economy, even though political pundits try hard to make it more complicated.)    I said last summer, when Trump announced his candidacy to widespread derision, that if he stayed on an economic message, he would be a formidable candidate. He did and he is.      And despite laughable lapses in judgment on other issues too numerous to mention here, it looks as though Trump will be the last Republican standing.    The trouble for Trump and Clinton is that both now have to explain what they will do to earn people's votes. "I will create jobs" just isn't enough. They have to get past the sizzle of that message and start slicing into that issue's meat.     And that's where there is a problem. The US economy is teetering on the verge of another recession. And it is happening before we have even recovered fully from the last downturn.     Americans feel the economy in their paychecks. So, while the Federal Reserve can pretend that the economy is on "solid footing" - as Bill Dudley, the clownish president of the New York Fed, recently said - no politician would dare say that.    There isn't enough space in this whole paper to explain all the problems that the US has. But let's try a couple of the big ones:    l The federal debt: It's already more than $19 trillion, and Washington has tried to cut the deficit by reducing spending, although annual deficits are still huge by historical standards.     Beggars like the US can't be truly independent if they have to look over their shoulder every time a decision is made, wondering what debt-holders China and the Saudis will think.    And since we are already in a horrible debt position, there's little chance that Washington will increase spending. So nix that as an idea for boosting the economy.    l Federal spending: So, Donald or Hillary might say, we'll just cut government spending drastically to get the debt down.    OK, where? Let's say they decide to get rid of the Census Bureau, an agency that I think has outlived its usefulness. That'll put thousands of its employees out of work - and many more people, once Census stops giving contracts to outside companies.    Let's cut the military? Or, at least, military benefits? That'll have us dealing with millions of unemployed soldiers and justifiably angry veterans.    l The "change the tax laws so everyone pays fairly" movement: I put this in the same category as Ask Santa Claus for Help. We've been talking about tax reform for years. It's. Never. Gonna. Happen. There are too many special interests who've already bought and paid for Washington politicians.    I don't know much about the flat tax movement, except that it purports to be a way to simplify the US tax system, make it fairer and increase revenue. And it might.     But does it make any sense in this lethargic economy to run tax experiments that could very easily backfire and jack up the federal debt? No.    l The "develop new industries and bring some old ones back to the US" people: Let's deal with the second one first. Sure, we can bring back manufacturing jobs, just as soon as Americans are willing to accept the low wages paid in Vietnam or Cambodia or India.    The problem is, Americans can't live on a pittance - at least not in the lifestyle to which they've become accustomed. That's being proved right now in the nationwide movement to raise the minimum wage.    How about new industries that can't go overseas? OK, which ones? We've already lowered our moral standards so that we can mine former vices like gambling and the use of marijuana.    What's left? Can allowing hookers on every street corner bring in enough revenue to make this an acceptable industry? If you think about it, that's one industry that would be difficult to outsource to other countries - although the tech geniuses in the virtual reality sector are trying.    l The stock market: Trump already knows that the stock market is in a bubble. Clinton couldn't acknowledge that even if she wanted to - too much of her wealth and campaign money comes from Wall Street.    But I don't think either understands that stocks are being kept artificially high on purpose by the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and their friends.    The next president had better keep a close eye on stocks or his/her administration will start out with a bust.    You already know my solution: Change the rules on retirement accounts so that the economy can be stimulated when people are allowed to use the trillions of dollars socked away for things like real estate, which will trickle down to other industries.     Donald, let's entertain some real proposals that will allow me to overlook your verbal gaffes and vote for you.     And Hillary, let's hear what you've got so that I can forgive you for leading what can only be described as a seriously flawed life of swindles, influence-peddling and other infractions that would have landed the average American in jail. 
November 13, 2016	 The New York Post	  What was surprising was the overwhelming number of people who voiced their alienation with the status quo. I believe it was a repudiation of the far left drift the Democratic party has taken under Obama.    There was also the politicization of federal departments and agencies - the IRS, Justice Department and State Department. And the fudging of numbers by Commerce and Census to put forth a narrative of economic wellness.      There was a media that was more lapdog than watchdog, and a university system that resembles day care for the infantile politically correct.    I did not vote for Trump. I could not in good conscience vote for either of them. But I believe this outcome was not so much a vote for Trump as it was a vote against the road we've been traveling. What do you think? G.C.    Dear G.C.: The only thing I disagree with is your first sentence. This was shocking. It was, in no small sense, a revolution at the voting booth. And it will reverberate for decades, not just years. Historians will write about it.     And politicians for generations will be talking about the defeat of Hillary Clinton - who almost everyone considered a sure thing - by Donald Trump the way people now look back to Ronald Reagan. I'm not saying Trump will be as good, although I do hope he will fix all our problems.     I, too, think this was a rebellion against the way the country has been going, but for the past 16 years. The ill-conceived wars that raised the national debt, the catering to the financial markets and Wall Street at the expense of everyone else.     The media? The performance of what is known as the "mainstream media" was an absolute disgrace. And it could be the turning point that leads to people seeking even more of their information through internet sources that aren't as tied up emotionally and financially with big corporations that have political agendas.     I agree with much of your "Not a Going Rate" article, but the $20 trillion debt figure is very misleading.    Over $4 trillion is in the lock box that never existed. The US tripled payroll taxes in the mid 1980s in order to generate - at the time - over $200 million in surplus tax revenue that was, of course, spent on other parts of the federal budget.     Those surpluses gradually shrunk to the point where there were no more, and now the US government borrows to fund both Social Security and Medicare.     The $4 trillion (that we borrowed from ourselves) does not really exist, only the future obligations for these plans.    There are also $2.5 trillion of US Treasury securities that have been purchased by the Federal Reserve as part of the various quantitative easing programs. Once again, the Treasury owes the Fed that money, but in reality it does not exist, except on paper. And I assume if the Fed holds these securities until maturity, they will then disappear.    I am no big fan of QE and would have preferred the genius Ph.D.s could have avoided the financial crisis in the first place, as opposed to coming up with ever more creative ways of supposedly saving the economy, but I digress.    Basically, $6.5 trillion of the debt is on paper owed to ourselves. Try to mention that next time you discuss this issue. B.B.    Dear B.B.: All debt is "future financial obligations." We don't have to repay the trillion bucks that China lent us by purchasing our bonds until, in the case of 30-year bonds, three decades from now.     Same with Social Security and Medicare, from which you correctly state we've borrowed close to $5 trillion.     As for QE, that's a whole different animal. Yes, the Fed bought trillions of dollars of government securities. But nobody really knows what happens to those securities in the long run. Will the US Treasury have to pay the Fed back? Probably not. Will those bonds just disappear into thin air? Maybe, but that would be like having printed $2.5 trillion in new money, which could be deemed hyper-inflationary by the markets and the rest of the world.    No, sorry, the real amount of US debt - as I type - is $19.8 trillion. And the interest payments on that debt alone is $485 billion a year.     Let's not dance around the issue just to make ourselves feel better. But thanks for expanding the discussion.  
September 14, 2016	 The New York Post	  When Bernie Sanders started winning primaries against Hillary Clinton, "Democrats should have realized they had a problem," writes the Star-Ledger's Paul Mulshine at NJ.com: "Simply stated: Hillary Clinton is not Bill Clinton." Bill, "the most talented politician of the past 40 years" would have understood candidates "are supposed to attack their political opponents, not the voters." But instead of going after Trump, Hillary "chose to insult close to a quarter of the voting public" with her "basket of deplorables" remark. Where Bill was charming, he writes, "Hillary is condescending," which is why "a lot of top Democrats are kicking themselves for failing to see Clinton's weaknesses earlier."    With North Korea's most recent nuclear-bomb test, writes Max Boot at Commentary, "the world's most closed and oppressive regime, led by a third-generation dictator who is willing to kill his own uncle," has become "ever more dangerous." President Obama "deserves credit for convincing the UN Security Council . . . to adopt its most stringent sanctions yet" - but, thanks to China, "they aren't really being enforced." The only possible way to do so "is if the US can raise the costs to China of inaction" by enforcing a new law that allows Washington "to impose secondary sanctions on Chinese firms doing business" with North Korea. Says Boot: "We need to squeeze Pyongyang hard enough that the pips squeak."    Clinton's supporters are comparing her to FDR and JFK, suggesting that "because both presidents are remembered fondly . . . the dishonesty that was perpetuated about their medical conditions was, in retrospect, a necessary evil," writes Jim Geraghty in National Review. But he suggests a better comparison: Paul Tsongas, whose 1992 candidacy (against Bill Clinton and others) showed "the potentially tragic consequences of lying about a presidential candidate's health." During the campaign, Tsongas publicly declared his lymphoma "cured," but just months later admitted "that a new growth in his abdomen was cancerous, and he underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatment." He also called on President-elect Clinton to "set up a commission to determine what medical information presidential candidates must disclose." It never happened; Tsongas died in January 1997.    Veteran attorney Nathan Lewin says the recent federal court ruling dismissing a lawsuit in which the families of US terror victims won $655 million from the Palestinian Authority seems "shockingly unjust" at first glance. But, writing in The Times of Israel, he calls it consistent with prior opinions limiting US courts' jurisdiction. Still, he notes, the PA is not entirely off the hook. For one thing, Congress can divert some of the $400 million in US aid to the PA over to those families. "Moreover," he adds, "the jurisdictional limitation against suing . . . does not apply to criminal prosecution." So it's all up to the Justice Department, whose failure thus far to prosecute a single terrorist "responsible for killing or maiming an American citizen in Israel" is "a patent dereliction of duty."    Yes, Clinton's "basket of deplorables" comment about Donald Trump supporters was "impolitic," writes Ramesh Ponnuru at Bloomberg. But was it wrong? Some Clinton supporters cite surveys to defend her - but ignore how many of her own supporters give similar answers. Fact is, "you can hold deplorable views without being a deplorable person in general." Bill Clinton understood this: He "saw that a lot of white voters had some legitimate concerns - about crime and welfare, for example - mixed up with some worse impulses." So he "addressed the legitimate concerns," but "refrained from condemning millions of people for harboring prejudices that he must have deplored."  
November 18, 2016	 The New York Post	  JPMorgan Chase on Thursday settled an embarrassing three-year federal probe into the company's so-called "Sons and Daughters" program, which gave jobs to 200 friends and relatives of Chinese officials in exchange for lucrative work in that country.     The bank, run by Chief Executive Jamie Dimon - who's currently under consideration by President-elect Donald Trump's transition team for Treasury secretary - paid $264 million to end the probe by the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve.     "Sons and Daughters" lasted seven years, until 2013, and generated about $100 million for the bank, according to a cease-and-desist order from the SEC.     "The so-called 'Sons and Daughters' program was nothing more than bribery by another name," Leslie Caldwell, head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said in a statement.     The program gave high-paying "photocopier" jobs to referrals from JPMorgan VIPs, according to the SEC settlement.     "Referral Hires generally did not meet the minimum educational, grade-point average, or background qualifications that JPMorgan APAC looked for in its non-referral hiring programs," the SEC said, referring to the bank's China unit.     And although JPMorgan investment bankers were aware as early as 2006 that the program violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, they didn't move to stop it for years.     "Confidential, just added son of #2 at [Chinese state-owned entity] to my team. I got room for a lot more hires like this ([competitor investment bank] has 25)," one investment banker wrote in a 2010 e-mail to a colleague.     "They are close to mandating banks for their IPO. We are a strong contender. Blink blink nod nod, can we find a place for his son (they have only approached us in this regard)?" one senior banker wrote in an e-mail during that same year, according to the SEC order.    "We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved," the bank's statement continued. "We have also made improvements to our hiring procedures, and reinforced the high standards of conduct expected of our people."    "JPMorgan executives belong in jail, but instead shareholders will foot the bill for what one government official described as 'systemic bribery,' " Bartlett Naylor, financial policy advocate at Public Citizen, said in a statement.     As for Dimon and the Treasury post, the CEO has said that he doesn't think he's fit for the Cabinet position. Those close to the discussion have downplayed the speculation.

December 22, 2016	 The New York Post	   Donald Trump has selected China hawk Peter Navarro to lead the White House National Trade Council, the president-elect's transition team announced Wednesday.     Navarro,   an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine, is the author of "Death by China: How America Lost its Manufacturing Base."    "I read one of Peter's books on America's trade problems years ago and was impressed," Trump said.   
December 18, 2016	 The New York Post	 China is promising to return a US submarine drone that its navy seized from international waters - but president-elect Donald Trump thinks we should just say, 'No thanks.'     "We should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back," Trump tweeted Saturday night.    The Pentagon had reached a deal earlier Saturday with the Chinese to turn over the US Navy research drone, which a Chinese crew had plucked from the South China Sea Thursday.    "Through direct engagement with Chinese authorities, we have secured an understanding that the Chinese will return the UUV [Underwater Unmanned Vehicle] to the United States," Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said.    They were tempered in their wording, objecting to what they called China's "unlawful seizure" of their equipment.    But shortly before 9 a.m., just before the deal was announced, Trump lambasted the Chinese for outright "stealing" the device.    "China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act," he tweeted.     "China and the United States have been communicating about this process. It is inappropriate and unhelpful for a resolution that the US has unilaterally hyped up the issue," Senior Col. Yang Yujun, a Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman, said early Saturday.     Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) tweeted that Trump's "escalation of a diplomatic crisis with China" was "madness."    But Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) on Friday called the incident a "flagrant violation of the freedom of the seas."    Pentagon officials said the drone was measuring ocean conditions, but Chinese officials accused the United States of conducting "surveillance and military surveys" with the equipment.    Earlier this month, Trump accepted a phone call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, breaking with diplomatic practice and riling China, which claims sovereignty over the island.    The president-elect has also questioned America's One China policy, which recognizes Taiwan as part of China.
