<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  JPMorgan Chase on Thursday settled an embarrassing three-year federal probe into the company's so-called &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; program, which gave jobs to 200 friends and relatives of Chinese officials in exchange for lucrative work in that country. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bank, run by Chief Executive Jamie Dimon - who's currently under consideration by President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team for Treasury secretary - paid $264 million to end the probe by the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; lasted seven years, until 2013, and generated about $100 million for the bank, according to a cease-and-desist order from the SEC.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The so-called 'Sons and Daughters' program was nothing more than bribery by another name,&quot; Leslie Caldwell, head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said in a statement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The program gave high-paying &quot;photocopier&quot; jobs to referrals from JPMorgan VIPs, according to the SEC settlement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Referral Hires generally did not meet the minimum educational, grade-point average, or background qualifications that JPMorgan APAC looked for in its non-referral hiring programs,&quot; the SEC said, referring to the bank's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unit.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And although JPMorgan investment bankers were aware as early as 2006 that the program violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, they didn't move to stop it for years.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Confidential, just added son of #2 at [Chinese state-owned entity] to my team. I got room for a lot more hires like this ([competitor investment bank] has 25),&quot; one investment banker wrote in a 2010 e-mail to a colleague.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;They are close to mandating banks for their IPO. We are a strong contender. Blink blink nod nod, can we find a place for his son (they have only approached us in this regard)?&quot; one senior banker wrote in an e-mail during that same year, according to the SEC order. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  JPMorgan, in a statement, called the practices &quot;unacceptable.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved,&quot; the bank's statement continued. &quot;We have also made improvements to our hiring procedures, and reinforced the high standards of conduct expected of our people.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The settlement did not sit well with bank critics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;JPMorgan executives belong in jail, but instead shareholders will foot the bill for what one government official described as 'systemic bribery,' &quot; Bartlett Naylor, financial policy advocate at Public Citizen, said in a statement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As for Dimon and the Treasury post, the CEO has said that he doesn't think he's fit for the Cabinet position. Those close to the discussion have downplayed the speculation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  JPMorgan shares rose 62 cents, to $78.02.kdugan@nypost.com </SPAN></P>
