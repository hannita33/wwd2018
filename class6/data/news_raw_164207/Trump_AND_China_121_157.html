<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Apple CEO Tim Cook vowed Wednesday to fight a federal court order to unlock California terrorist Syed Rizwan Farook's iPhone - setting the stage for an epic battle between law-enforcement agencies and privacy advocates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The unprecedented clash could affect millions of cellphone users across the United States by opening what Cook called a &quot;back door&quot; into iPhones that hold &shy;everything from banking passwords to embarrassing photos. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;In the wrong hands, this software - which does not exist &shy;today - would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone's physical possession,&quot; Cook warned in an open letter to Apple customers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that's simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The outcome will ripple across the globe, with Russia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other authoritarian governments the big winners if Apple fails to overturn the order handed down late Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Why in the world would our government want to give repressive regimes in Russia and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a blueprint for forcing American companies to create a back door?&quot; US Sen. Ron Wyden &shy;(D-Ore.), a leader on tech and privacy issues, told the Guardian. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The case involves an employer-issued iPhone 5C carried by &shy;Farook, a homegrown ISIS supporter who went on a December shooting rampage with his wife, Tashfeen Malik, that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., before the couple was gunned down in a shootout with cops. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  California US Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym, a former federal prosecutor, sided with the Justice Department, which said investigators had been stymied by encryption software on Farook's iPhone that is instructed to erase its data after 10 consecutive unsuccessful attempts to unlock it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Federal agents want to retrace the couple's movements between the time of the massacre and their deaths - and learn if they got outside help. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pym ordered Apple to create special software so the FBI could bypass the self-destruct feature, along with a &quot;unique identifier&quot; to prevent it from being used to unlock other iPhones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pym also gave Apple five days to appeal her order. As a jurist on the lowest rung of the federal-court system, her ruling can't set a binding precedent without &shy;being affirmed by higher courts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Google CEO Sundar Pichai sided with business rival Cook, tweeting: &quot;We build secure products to keep your information safe and we give law enforcement access to data based on valid legal orders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;But that's wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices and data. Could be a troubling precedent,&quot; he added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton hailed Pym's decision, saying that &quot;the right to privacy is not a total right in the sense that if it is being used for criminal purposes, that's where the courts come into play.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Republican presidential front-runner, also said he agreed &quot;100 percent with the courts.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It's ridiculous that the government has to be put in a position where if they have information about a possible attack, we waste a second,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gary Miliefsky of SnoopWall, a counter-cyber-crime company that works with police departments, governments and banks, among others, predicted disaster if Apple lost the case. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The iPhone is a Cadillac with six air bags. If they back-door it, they've turned it into a Ford Pinto,&quot; Miliefsky said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'The US government has asked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too dangerous to create. They have asked us to build a back door to the iPhone. - Apple CEO Tim Cook </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The federal government and Apple CEO Tim Cook are warring over privacy laws as officials seek access to California terrorist Syed Rizwan Farook's iPhone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  GOVERNMENT: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Wants the ability to piece together 18 minutes of timeline from day of attacks </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Needs Apple software that allows it to crack security code </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Is trying to find out whether Farook and his wife had help from terror cells </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Claims the request involves only one phone </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  APPLE: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Believes &quot;the technique could be used over and over again&quot; Warns the software is &quot;too dangerous to create&quot; and will compromise personal information and put personal safety at risk </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Says personal information must be protected from hackers </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Insists the US is forcing it to aid in &quot;surveillance&quot; </SPAN></P>
