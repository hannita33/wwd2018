<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mainstream media has tossed aside all pretense of objectivity to beat Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, writes former NPR CEO Ken Stern at Vanity Fair. And even if you buy the justification that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a unique threat to America, he says, we should all be concerned about the media's ability to unring this bell. &quot;Attitude changes like these have a way of normalizing very quickly. I can easily imagine, for instance, a similar response from the mainstream media if Mike Huckabee or Ted Cruz, or some other similarly non-traditional candidate were to secure the nomination of the Republican Party for President in 2020. Having helped successfully scuttle the nomination of one candidate, it may be terribly tempting for our leading organizations and media outlets to seek an encore performance.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the left: Why We Need More Charter Schools </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The argument over whether charter schools &quot;work&quot; misses a key point, writes David Leonhardt in The New York Times. And that is the fact that one type of charter school &quot;has repeatedly shown impressive results.&quot; It's what is known as a &quot;high expectations, high support&quot; educational model: &quot;They devote more of their resources to classroom teaching and less to almost everything else. They keep students in class for more hours. They set high standards for students and try to instill confidence in them. They focus on giving teachers feedback about their craft and helping them get better.&quot; Leonhardt notes that these schools help poor and minority children catch up with wealthier white kids. So why aren't there more of them? Leonhardt explains the &quot;messy&quot; politics of education - which, first and foremost, means those with a vested interest in traditional schools, like teachers unions and their political champions, oppose them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the campaign Trail: The Next </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fame has enabled him to run for president without spending a huge chunk of his personal fortune, writes Jim Antle at the Washington Examiner. So, will other celebrities follow suit? &quot;In April, George Clooney raised $15 million in two high-dollar fundraisers for Hillary Clinton. A seat at the head table with Clinton and the Clooneys reportedly went for $353,400. Jane Fonda and Ellen DeGeneres were on hand as attendees dined on Chilean sea bass and prawn risotto.&quot; Yet the irony is that &quot;it's Republican celebrities who have been most likely to win elected office&quot; - Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sonny Bono, Fred Thompson, Ronald Reagan. Politics can be bad for a celebrity's brand, Antle warns. &quot;But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has undeniably shown how far an ego and an audience can get you in politics.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Foreign-policy wonk: What The Donald Got Right </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Republicans should admit Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> got a few things right, counsels Danielle Pletka in The Washington Post. He understood that our &quot;feckless&quot; fight against ISIS projects weakness. And on trade: &quot;The truth is that deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership have been oversold - not because their benefits don't vastly outweigh their costs, but because the pro-trade side fails to acknowledge that some workers truly end up displaced. The guy who loses his job when his factory decamps to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can be forgiven for thinking elites are full of it when they intone on the universal benefits of free trade.&quot; Pletka advises: &quot;It's not that Americans don't want to engage with the world, it's that they want to engage successfully.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the right: IRS Targeting Never Stopped </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Remember the IRS scandal over the agency targeting conservative nonprofits? Well, it's still happening, writes Rick Moran at PJ Media: &quot;A federal judge in Ohio has had it with the IRS foot-dragging on applications from conservative organizations for exempt status and has ordered the agency to quit stalling.&quot; The order, contained in a filing unsealed Friday, makes clear that &quot;three years after being assured by the IRS that they had stopped singling out conservative organizations for special scrutiny, the targeting continues,&quot; Moran says. It also shows the IRS' utter contempt for the investigation, according to Moran. The targeting will continue, Moran says, &quot;until a judge holds a couple of IRS managers in contempt and lets them cool their heels in jail for a few days.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
