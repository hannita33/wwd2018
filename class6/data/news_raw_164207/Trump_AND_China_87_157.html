</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign-policy remarks Wednesday will serve him well with voters: He offered a clear critique of what the nation's been doing wrong, and promised a new &quot;coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His &quot;America First&quot; approach is a clear contrast with Hillary Clinton - who embraces the foreign-policy establishment that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> faults for failing the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He started by identifying the key problems: Too few resources, with a weakened military and a weakened US economy. Allies who aren't stepping up - in part because they no longer trust Washington to have their backs. Enemies who don't fear us, and rivals who don't respect us. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Above all, &quot;America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign-policy goals.&quot; And we haven't since the end of the Cold War. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All indisputably true. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Along the way, he slammed the Obama-Clinton record of &quot;weakness, confusion and disarray&quot; - while also disavowing the interventionism and na&iuml;ve nation-building efforts of the Bush years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He de facto embraced the one aspect of Obama's policy the public likes: &quot;I will not send our finest into battle unless necessary - and I mean absolutely necessary.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Again, the contrast with Clinton is obvious: She's always been more hawkish than Obama; it's one reason he beat her in 2008. She pushed for the Libya war, and for intervention in Syria that Obama rejected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will fight &quot;when there is no alternative - but when America fights, it must only fight to win.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This isn't isolationism, but a longstanding US tradition that runs from the (Colin) Powell Doctrine all the way to Andrew Jackson. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the same spirit, and also in stark contrast to Clinton, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repudiated mindless internationalism: Enough with agreements that limit the nation's &quot;ability to control our own affairs.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His overall goal is &quot;creating stability in the world&quot; - notably in the Middle East. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He wants &quot;a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam&quot; and promises ISIS's &quot;days are numbered.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He'll rebuild the US military and US economy, try for realistic understandings with rivals like Russia and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - and refocus US alliances in Europe and Asia for the challenges of today. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's a tall order - but a coherent set of aims. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;We must make America respected again. We must make America truly wealthy again. And we must, we have to and we will make America great again,&quot; he summed up.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;And if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever known.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Game on, Hillary. </SPAN></P>
