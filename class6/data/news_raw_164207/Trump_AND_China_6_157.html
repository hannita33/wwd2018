<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I get it when I need it,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told &quot; Fox News Sunday ,&quot; explaining that  he refuses the opportunity to be briefed daily by security professionals on classified threats  the way President Obama  is .  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I'm, like, a smart person,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. &quot;I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years - could be eight years. I don't need that.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The boastful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - who once said he knows more than the US generals about fighting ISIS - said he trusts the three generals he has nominated for his Cabinet and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who receive intelligence briefings regularly.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is opting for weekly updates and says intelligence officials can always contact him if a situation has worsened.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;But I do say, 'If something should change, let us know,' &quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a rare extended interview, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also said he is not &quot;bound&quot; to the &quot;One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; policy unless </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> makes a new deal with him on trade, currency devaluation, North Korea and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> island building in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I fully understand the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said of the longstanding US practice of following mainland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lead in describing itself as the only true nation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which the president-elect disrupted by taking a phone call from Taiwan's president, &quot;but I don't know why we have to be bound by a One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy unless we make a deal with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> having to do with other things.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The New York billionaire is in the midst of trying to separate himself from his vast international business empire and leaving his namesake organization to his adult children.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I am turning down billions of dollars of deals,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said of his current involvement. &quot;I turned down seven deals with one big player, great player, last week, because I thought it could be perceived as a conflict of interest.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he dismissed criticism that world governments are trying to curry favor with him through his businesses, such as by having foreign diplomats stay at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hotel in Washington, DC. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;When I ran, everybody knew that I was a very big owner of real estate all over the world,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
