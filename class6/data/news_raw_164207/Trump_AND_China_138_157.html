<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hillary Clinton solicited a $12 million donation from a government her State Department considered corrupt, then realized the &quot;mess&quot; it would cause to her presidential run, a newly leaked &shy;e-mail reveals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  King Mohammed VI of Morocco agreed to give the money to the Clinton Foundation, provided that it hold a convention in his country in May 2015 with Clinton as the keynote speaker.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Clinton realized that the conference, slated for a month after she announced her run for president, would hurt her candidacy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;No matter what happens, she will be in Morocco hosting CGI [Clinton Global Initiative] on May 5-7, 2015. Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this,&quot; top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to campaign manager Robby Mook in a November 2014 e-mail revealed by Wiki&shy;Leaks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In another e-mail, Abedin warned that if Clinton didn't attend, the $12 million would be off the table. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Just to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter,&quot; Abedin wrote in a January 2015 &shy;e-mail to Mook and campaign manager John &shy;Podesta. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;CGI also wasn't pushing for a meeting in Morocco and it wasn't their first choice. This was HRC's idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx $12 million both for the [foundation's] endowment and to support the meeting,&quot; Abedin continued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It will break a lot of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">china</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to back out now when we had so many opportunities to do it in the past few months. She created this mess and she knows it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The king gave the money to the Clinton Foundation and underwrote the CGI summit with the quid-pro-quo understanding that Hillary would attend, and other dignitaries attending were led to believe that she would be there.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Hillary sent Bill and Chelsea Clinton while she campaigned in Nevada and California. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The deal with Morocco was struck even though the State Department - under Hillary Clinton - accused the country's government of &quot;arbitrary arrests and corruption,&quot; according to Fox News.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was unclear exactly how much went directly for the summit and how much went to the Clinton Foundation - but the total added up to $12 million, according to the e-mails. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Guests at the May 2015 CGI summit - which was closed to the media - stayed at the five-star Selman-Marrakesh hotel, a posh lodging featuring a stable of Arabian horses and luxury amenities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The meeting was officially paid for by OCP, a Moroccan-government-owned mining company that has been accused of human-rights violations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Hillary Clinton supported the monarch when she was secretary of state, and the US-financed Export-Import Bank gave OCP a $92 million loan guarantee during her tenure, The Daily Caller reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Politico reported in 2015 that Clinton &quot;was seen by [the Moroccan capital] Rabat as among its staunchest supporters in the Obama administration.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice charged OCP with &quot;serious human-rights violations,&quot; the Daily Caller said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Mohamed Yeslem Beisat, the Washington envoy for the self-described &quot;government in exile&quot; Polisario Front, told US News &amp; World Report in April 2013 that &quot;OCP is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation - it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past 40 years.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beisat added, &quot;They're doing this because they know Hillary has some chances of being president of the United States. And they want her to support their brutal occupation of Western Sahara.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Human-rights advocates have called the company's mined phosphates &quot;blood phosphates&quot; - similar to the term &quot;blood diamonds,&quot; referring to precious stones mined in war zones and/or used to finance deadly conflicts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Abedin's e-mail was among more than 4,000 posted Thursday by WikiLeaks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   They were stolen from Podesta, who has warned that the communications may have been doctored. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  US intelligence agencies have fingered the Russian government as the culprits behind the hack - charging that Russian President Vladimir Putin was trying to influence the US election in Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> favor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Wednesday's final presidential debate, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> insisted - without offering evidence - that &quot;no one knows&quot; who hacked the &shy;e-mails. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton slammed her opponent for using the purloined e-mails to attack her, as well as for his past statements encouraging the Russians to hack her e-mails from when she was secretary of state. </SPAN></P>
