<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Long Island Rep. Peter King wants to break up the &quot;romance&quot; between Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his Russian man-crush Vladimir Putin.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  King, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> backer, said Sunday he still has &quot;real questions&quot; about the presumptive GOP presidential nominee's foreign-policy chops and begged the mogul to quit his infatuation with the Russian leader - telling CBS's &quot;Face the Nation&quot; that he's &quot;very concerned about this romance he seems to have with Putin.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;And as far as his statement that he wants Russia to take care of what is happening in Syria, that's Barack Obama's policy,&quot; King added. &quot;But, again, there's a lot about Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I like. He's brought people into the Republican Party. He's brought in the blue-collar Reagan Democrats, which we had lost over the years.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  King says there's plenty </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must do to burnish his qualifications as leader of the free world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I'm supporting him as the nominee of the party, but I still have real questions with him as far as national security,&quot; the Republican congressman said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I don't think his Asian policy is coherent, because, again, if he does want to get in a trade war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he has to explain how that coincides with him wanting to use </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against North Korea. If he wants to have leverage over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, how can he be talking about taking troops out of Japan and Korea?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another congressional </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> backer, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be prone to awkward moments on the trail because &quot;more than most candidates, he's a work in progress.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Usually you know a lot more about a candidate because they've run for other things,&quot; Cole told ABC's &quot;This Week.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;He does have a shoot-from-the-hip style,&quot; Cole said. &quot;He's already said things he ought to regret and I think he will regret politically.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
