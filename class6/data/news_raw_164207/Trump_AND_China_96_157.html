<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Bernie Sanders started winning primaries against Hillary Clinton, &quot;Democrats should have realized they had a problem,&quot; writes the Star-Ledger's Paul Mulshine at NJ.com: &quot;Simply stated: Hillary Clinton is not Bill Clinton.&quot; Bill, &quot;the most talented politician of the past 40 years&quot; would have understood candidates &quot;are supposed to attack their political opponents, not the voters.&quot; But instead of going after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Hillary &quot;chose to insult close to a quarter of the voting public&quot; with her &quot;basket of deplorables&quot; remark. Where Bill was charming, he writes, &quot;Hillary is condescending,&quot; which is why &quot;a lot of top Democrats are kicking themselves for failing to see Clinton's weaknesses earlier.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Foreign affairs analyst: No Heat on North Korea </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With North Korea's most recent nuclear-bomb test, writes Max Boot at Commentary, &quot;the world's most closed and oppressive regime, led by a third-generation dictator who is willing to kill his own uncle,&quot; has become &quot;ever more dangerous.&quot; President Obama &quot;deserves credit for convincing the UN Security Council . . . to adopt its most stringent sanctions yet&quot; - but, thanks to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, &quot;they aren't really being enforced.&quot; The only possible way to do so &quot;is if the US can raise the costs to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of inaction&quot; by enforcing a new law that allows Washington &quot;to impose secondary sanctions on Chinese firms doing business&quot; with North Korea. Says Boot: &quot;We need to squeeze Pyongyang hard enough that the pips squeak.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Conservative take: Hillary Like FDR - Or Tsongas? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton's supporters are comparing her to FDR and JFK, suggesting that &quot;because both presidents are remembered fondly . . . the dishonesty that was perpetuated about their medical conditions was, in retrospect, a necessary evil,&quot; writes Jim Geraghty in National Review. But he suggests a better comparison: Paul Tsongas, whose 1992 candidacy (against Bill Clinton and others) showed &quot;the potentially tragic consequences of lying about a presidential candidate's health.&quot; During the campaign, Tsongas publicly declared his lymphoma &quot;cured,&quot; but just months later admitted &quot;that a new growth in his abdomen was cancerous, and he underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatment.&quot; He also called on President-elect Clinton to &quot;set up a commission to determine what medical information presidential candidates must disclose.&quot; It never happened; Tsongas died in January 1997. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Legal expert: How To Compensate US Terror Victims </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Veteran attorney Nathan Lewin says the recent federal court ruling dismissing a lawsuit in which the families of US terror victims won $655 million from the Palestinian Authority seems &quot;shockingly unjust&quot; at first glance. But, writing in The Times of Israel, he calls it consistent with prior opinions limiting US courts' jurisdiction. Still, he notes, the PA is not entirely off the hook. For one thing, Congress can divert some of the $400 million in US aid to the PA over to those families. &quot;Moreover,&quot; he adds, &quot;the jurisdictional limitation against suing . . . does not apply to criminal prosecution.&quot; So it's all up to the Justice Department, whose failure thus far to prosecute a single terrorist &quot;responsible for killing or maiming an American citizen in Israel&quot; is &quot;a patent dereliction of duty.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Campaign analyst: What Hill Missed On 'Deplorables' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yes, Clinton's &quot;basket of deplorables&quot; comment about Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters was &quot;impolitic,&quot; writes Ramesh Ponnuru at Bloomberg. But was it wrong? Some Clinton supporters cite surveys to defend her - but ignore how many of her own supporters give similar answers. Fact is, &quot;you can hold deplorable views without being a deplorable person in general.&quot; Bill Clinton understood this: He &quot;saw that a lot of white voters had some legitimate concerns - about crime and welfare, for example - mixed up with some worse impulses.&quot; So he &quot;addressed the legitimate concerns,&quot; but &quot;refrained from condemning millions of people for harboring prejudices that he must have deplored.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
