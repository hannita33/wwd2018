<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With polls showing the &quot;vast majority of voters&quot; dislike the two major candidates, how did they wind up as the nominees? The simple answer, writes Jay Cost at The Weekly Standard, is &quot;that's democracy.&quot; In fact, it's &quot;substantially more complicated&quot; - because before voters get to decide, someone else selects the process. So dissatisfied voters &quot;should blame the parties - and start demanding party reform.&quot; Indeed, the fact that it doesn't specify how to select candidates for office is &quot;the gravest weakness of the Constitution.&quot; And &quot;this election demonstrates that it is nearly impossible to produce good policy from a bad process.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  College prez: Why We're Suing Feds On Title IX </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Everett Piper, president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, explains at Heat Street why his school is &quot;the first and only institution suing the Obama administration over its directives about how universities should address sexual harassment and assault.&quot; Those Title IX orders, he writes, &quot;violate not only due process but also our students' basic constitutional rights.&quot; Instead of encouraging victims to go to police, &quot;the Obama administration has mandated universities convene a committee of amateurs to look into allegations of sex crimes.&quot; Finally, the administration also is &quot;requiring universities to conduct seminars on how to have consensual sex without legal consequence&quot; - which violates the &quot;unapologetically Christian&quot; school's &quot;beliefs and code of conduct.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the right: Chicago's Self-Inflicted Crime Crisis </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With 512 homicides already recorded this year - more than in all of 2015 - Chicago is &quot;experiencing a crisis of law and order,&quot; one that is &quot;almost entirely self-inflicted,&quot; say the editors of National Review. Indeed, &quot;Chicago is perhaps the most obvious example to date of the 'Ferguson Effect',&quot; in which &quot;police in minority neighborhoods have backed off interacting with residents when not absolutely necessary.&quot; But Mayor Rahm Emanuel &quot;and the rest of Chicago's left-wing city government have only compounded the problem&quot; by forming a task force that declared Chicago's police department racist and demanded &quot;predictably ludicrous&quot; accountability measures which he quickly adopted. Bottom line: &quot;Chicago's leaders seem to be more interested in accommodating left-wing interest groups than in saving lives.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Foreign desk: Why Obama's Asia Pivot Cost Lives  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's both &quot;tragic and fitting that President Obama's latest failure to reach a cease-fire in Syria&quot; took place in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, writes Eli Lake at Bloomberg View. Tragic, because Syria's death toll has now passed 400,000. But fitting, &quot;because the rationale for Obama's reluctance to intervene in Syria goes back to a first-term strategy to pivot diplomatic attention and military hardware away from wars in the Middle East to the Asia-Pacific region.&quot; Yet even this has failed to curtail &quot;Beijing's aggressive moves in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea to dredge up new islands and lay claim to the territorial waters of other US allies like the Philippines.&quot; Obama's failure to enforce his &quot;red line&quot; on Syria's use of chemical weapons &quot;may also be the moment that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> learned it could defy the US president and face no consequences.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Centrist's advice: Face It, Hillary - You're an Elitist </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hillary Clinton's best hope is to accept that she's the establishment candidate, writes David Ignatius in The Washington Post. She &quot;can't escape her mainstream pedigree,&quot; he says, and &quot;she's not a convincing populist: The more she tries to sound like one, the more she risks coming off as a phony.&quot; Fact is, says Ignatius, Clinton's &quot;current strategy, a sort of Bernie Sanders Lite, doesn't seem to be working very well&quot; against outsider Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Middle-class voters want to see a more robust economy and fairer distribution of economic growth. But Clinton &quot;too often makes her agenda sound like a liberal laundry list.&quot; </SPAN></P>
