<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As he prepares to leave office, President Obama &quot;sees an opposition Republican Party dominating America at the federal, state and local levels to a degree unseen since the 1920s,&quot; writes Timothy Lee at the Center for Individual Freedom. This after eight years of his having &quot;demonized Republicans and questioned their very morality, hoping to convince the electorate that they're unfit to govern.&quot; So much for Obama's oft-stated determination to occupy &quot;the right side of history.&quot; Fact is, &quot;the arc of the moral universe&quot; - Martin Luther King's phrase that became the president's watchword - &quot;simply did not bend in the way Obama presumed.&quot; Says Lee: &quot;The good news is that time occasionally catches up&quot; with such phrases &quot;and exposes their artifice.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Numbers cruncher: Min-Wage Hike Is Jobs-Killer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New York is heading over the next three years to a $15-an-hour minimum wage, its highest ever. But the Empire Center's E.J. McMahon, writing for Crain's New York, says it's a journey &quot;into uncharted territory, fraught with risks and trade-offs for workers and businesses.&quot; The initial downside &quot;may be less apparent&quot; if employment in the city continues to rise with favorable economic conditions. But &quot;those early numbers will be misleading - because they won't show the added job growth that would have occurred if the minimum wage stayed the same.&quot; The bottom line: &quot;The real minimum wage remains zero - the amount earned by someone who can't find a job. Unfortunately, thanks to the rising minimum wage, more New Yorkers are likely to fall into that category.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Energy reporter: Why Tillerson Could Succeed at State </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson reportedly remains President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> top choice for secretary of state. And despite his lack of government or political experience, Ellen R. Wald at Forbes suggests there are &quot;several reasons&quot; why &quot;his unique experience would make him . . . unusually effective.&quot; He's &quot;an experienced and accomplished negotiator&quot; with &quot;foreign and US governments and major international conglomerates.&quot; He has &quot;experience managing a large operation,&quot; and he &quot;knows world leaders and understands their motivations.&quot; As for his ties to Vladimir Putin, many of those raising concerns also &quot;consider Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad's friendly ties to Chinese President Xi Jinping a positive component of his appointment as ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Media critic: Even Times Movie Review is Anti-Israel </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ira Stoll at The Algemeiner takes issue with a recent New York Times review of a new documentary about an Israeli basketball team. The film, &quot;On the Map,&quot; chronicles the team's surprising 1977 victory in the prestigious European basketball championship. But the Times complains that the film is &quot;relentlessly partisan&quot; and &quot;makes no attempt to engage any current situation.&quot; Says Stoll, &quot;If anyone is being one-dimensional here, it is The New York Times, which seems to want to view nearly every piece of art that ever comes out of Israel&quot; through the paper's &quot;obsession [with] the contemporary Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&quot; As &quot;an example of press bias, this one is a slam dunk.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Historian: Faithless Electors are Dem Fantasy </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The move to get enough Republican members of the Electoral College to switch their votes and toss the election to Hillary Clinton is &quot;all a shadow play - entertaining, provocative, but bearing no relation to current political reality.&quot; For one thing, writes Jeff Greenfield for The Daily Beast, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;electoral majority is simply too big.&quot; But even if it happened, those votes &quot;would have to be validated by the appropriate state official.&quot; And if found to violate state law requiring votes for their pledged candidate, &quot;that official might well refuse to count&quot; a switched vote. Yet even then, Congress must unanimously accept the results of the Electoral College vote - and both houses are GOP-controlled. In other words, it won't happen. </SPAN></P>
