<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  FRIG Nixon. Watergate lives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Once the watershed for &quot;Let me be perfectly clear . . . I am not a crook . . . ,&quot; the newly exquisite hotel reopened Tuesday after Euro Capital's $125 million scrub. The jammed debut outnumbered those who bid adieu to Richard Milhous. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Amid staffers in Emmywinning &quot;Mad Men&quot; costume designer's uniforms, against an ultramod, curved, undulating copper wall with customcurled silver lamps, former Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, twotime GOP nominee (for vice president in '76, and president in '96), told me: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I've spoken with Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once he called me, once I called him. I like him. Two weeks ago, I said I'd be his senior adviser - but to be president of the United States, he has to tone it down. Getting things done in Washington means working with both sides of the House. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;In the old days, my friend Sen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pat Moynihan never got deserved credit for saving Social Security. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You can't have everything. Nobody gets all they want in life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Give a little, get a little. Compromise. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cooperation is working together. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's not about Democrats and Republicans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Yes, this country can be No. 1 again. I am encouraged with the new generation. Look, I remember we had problems with our generation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Both candidates are flawed. But this is the year to run. Sound bites are easy. Problem is, you have to back them up. Donald needs solid people. He's never been in politics, but he can do it.&quot; Dole's wife, Elizabeth, stunning in a designer suit and heels, stood inside a herd of wash 'n' wear partying locals as Sen. Dole said: &quot;I'm going to the convention. My friends want me to be there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;In '96, I was 73. Nixon [had previously written a] twopage letter to me, saying: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'Your age is not a factor. You have a sound voice. But if the economy is good, you cannot beat Bill Clinton. Your campaign cannot suggest things mightn't improve. Saying things could get worse is not a winner.' &quot;Donald's got a big following. Republicans like the guy but feel he's gone too far. He can win. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He's just got to tone it down.&quot; And why is Dole at the reopening of this National Registry of Historic Places hotel, which once housed bodies like Elizabeth Taylor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Martha Mitchell and Nixon's secretary Rose Mary Woods, who somehow couldn't account for 18 minutes of her boss' erased tape? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I love the Watergate Hotel. It will be great again. We have a lot to do. We'll all be great again.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Selling Joan's shmattas </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  MELISSA Rivers' private party Thursday precedes Christie's Joan Rivers auction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;My mom never saw a tag sale she didn't like. Of her thousands of glossy, ornate, rococo objects, she said, 'It's what Marie Antoinette would've had if she'd had any taste.' About Louis XVI cream and pink painted chairs that upheld Wendy Williams' rear, she said: 'My own ass has been on every seat.'  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Tons of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">china,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> service for all New York, like for when Nancy Reagan came. Frames, objects, boxes, books, tables, Faberg&eacute;. Mom once gave me notes for friends. Her red chinchilla jacket to you, large vase to Deborah Norville.' One big-ticket item, maybe $150,000, will be her mahogany commode.&quot; Who peed in it? &quot;I can't say exactly but, trust me, it's for an older, large prostate.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Melissa is then in Washington, DC, to open and close the Kennedy Center's Joan Rivers Tribute and preserve forever Joan's Master Joke File.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As for settling the medical claim surrounding her mother's death, minus a deposition or protracted lawsuit: &quot;I have that minute-by-minute log. The outcome could not be different. My son did not need to relive that horror. Nor can I live through that pain. Those who need to assume responsibility did.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Overheard in the Hamptons: &quot;You can overnight in the Lincoln Bedroom or do a flyover in Air Force One, providing your wallet is considered carry-on luggage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Only in New York, kids, only in New York.  </SPAN></P>
