<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> showed Tuesday that he's not a typical baby-kissing politician. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A baby started crying at his campaign rally in Ashburn, Va., and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at first shrugged off the interruption. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Don't worry about that baby, I love babies . . . I hear that baby crying. I like it. What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The mom's running around like - don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy, and that's what we want.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He then returned to his remarks about how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has &quot;ripped us to shreds&quot; - but then the baby started wailing again.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At that point, an annoyed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> turned toward the mom and said, &quot;Actually, I was only kidding. You can get the baby out of here . . . I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also revealed he plans to spend $100 million of his own money in his effort to become president.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I put up a lot of money to fund my own campaign,&quot; he said. &quot;I think I'm into this for over $60 million now . . . I'll probably be in for $100 million by the time I finish. Think of it, $100 million cash . . . and no tax deduction.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the start of the event, a man identified as Lt. Col. Louis Dorfman gave </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a Purple Heart - a US military decoration awarded to those who are wounded or killed while serving. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I always wanted to get the Purple Heart,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. &quot;This was much easier, but I tell you it was such an honor.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Records show Dorfman received the award after being wounded in Iraq in 2007. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Military Order of the Purple Heart issued a statement criticizing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not get the Purple Heart, and there's no 'easy way' to get it,&quot; the group said. </SPAN></P>
