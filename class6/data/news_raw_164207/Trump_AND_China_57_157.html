<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nominee for secretary of state on Wednesday took a tougher stance on Russia than the president-elect - calling the country dangerous because of its global ambitions and bombing of civilians. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Russia today poses a danger, but it is not unpredictable in advancing its own interests. It has invaded Ukraine, including the taking of Crimea, and supported Syrian forces that brutally violate the laws of war,&quot; Rex Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at his confirmation hearing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Our NATO allies are right to be alarmed at a resurgent Russia,&quot; said the ExxonMobil CEO, adding that Russia had no right to invade and annex Crimea in 2014 - and that if Moscow tried to seize more territory by force, the United States and its allies should stop it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;If Russia acts with force, that requires a proportional show of force that there will be no more taking of territory,&quot; Tillerson said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He charged that the Obama administration was overly timid in its response to the annexation of Crimea, and should have told the Russians that the land grab &quot;stops right here.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he refused to call Vladimir Putin a war criminal when pressed about the Russian president's brutal repression at home and military action abroad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I would not use that term,&quot; Tillerson told Sen. Marco Rubio, who has said he has &quot;serious concerns&quot; about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pick for America's top diplomatic post. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rubio (R-Fla.) said Russia's seizing of Crimea, targeting of innocent civilians in Aleppo and support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should not make it hard to say that Putin committed war crimes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tillerson said also it's a &quot;fair assumption&quot; that Putin orchestrated Moscow's meddling in the US 2016 presidential election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He opposed US sanctions levied on Moscow following its annexation of the Crimean peninsula, penalties that cost ExxonMobil hundreds of millions of dollars. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he said he would support sanctions if a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration believed they were necessary.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agreed with his tough positions, the oilman said he had only a general conversation with the president-elect on the topic - &quot;in a broad construct and in terms of the principals that are going to guide&quot; Russia policy, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Tillerson also said that if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't enforce UN sanctions on North Korea, the United States should consider actions that would compel Beijing to comply. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He vowed to fight ISIS, and said he rejected </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inflammatory comments about Mexican &quot;rapists&quot; crossing the border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Mexico is a longstanding neighbor and friend of this country,&quot; he said. &quot;I would never characterize an entire population with any single term.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
