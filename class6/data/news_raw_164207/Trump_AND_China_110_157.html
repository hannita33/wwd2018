<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Controversial tech investor Peter Thiel has found himself wrapped up in another sticky lawsuit - only this time he has a lot more than his reputation at stake. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The latest lawsuit involves a $7 billion contract to operate 4G wireless networks in Mexico.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thiel invested in the telecom startup that lost a spectrum auction Nov. 4 - because, the company claims in court papers, the Mexican government and its rival acted improperly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The dispute, simmering in a Mexican court, pits the only US bidder for the spectrum against the Mexican government as the new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration is looking to reset trade relations with President Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The international dustup centers on Rivada Networks, the startup backed in part by the Facebook billionaire's Mithril Capital. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The nasty legal battle includes allegations that seem ripped from the pages of a script for a Mexican telenovela. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For example, one person involved in the deal is accused of murder. Then there are stolen corporate documents and accusations of favoritism at the highest levels of Nieto's government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We are continuing the lawsuit because we are convinced we were the victims of [bad behavior],&quot; said Declan Ganley, CEO of Rivada. &quot;Plus, we don't want to see the people of Mexico's opportunity for this potential network disappear.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The spectrum auction, overseen by the Mexican government, is the first step to bring high-speed, low-cost wireless services to millions of Mexicans by early 2018. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rivada, based in Herndon, Va., gathered a group of high-net-worth investors, including Charlie Ergen's EchoStar and Ricky Sandler's Eminence Capital, to enter the auction - one of the world's most lucrative. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to powerful investors, Rivada also boasted an A-list board, including Jeb Bush, Gen. Richard B. Myers and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rivada Networks operates wireless networks from Argentina to Ireland, and it is currently bidding for the right to create first responder networks all over the US as part of a project called FirstNet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rivada had high hopes heading into last fall - but feels Nieto's government acted to hand the lucrative spectrum to Alt&aacute;n, Rivada's only rival in the auction, according to a lawsuit it filed in a Mexican court and interviews with company brass. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rivada's allegations include: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l Nieto's Secretaria de Communicaciones y Transportes [SCT], the country's communications department, allowed Alt&aacute;n to eyeball nonpublic bidding documents, giving it an improper advantage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;Rivada learned through credible sources that the Alt&aacute;n Consortium was improperly given access to the confidential internal SCT Business Model, which outlined the internal standards by which SCT was to judge the bids,&quot; court papers allege. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;In fact, the Business Model was used as a 'cheat sheet' for Alt&aacute;n's preparation of its bid: the bid, Rivada has learned, was identical to the Business Model in multiple, critical respects,&quot; court papers said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An Alt&aacute;n spokesperson, in a Dec. 21, statement, denied such claims. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;[Alt&aacute;n's] winning proposal to roll out Red Compartida [the spectrum market] is entirely original, independent and unique. Alt&aacute;n has not sought or had access to insider information at any point during the process.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l Nieto's administration improperly booted Ergen's EchoStar from the Rivada group just four days before the bids were due, citing antitrust issues. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ergen was believed to have too many connections with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The late-in-the-game move by Nieto's government all but killed the Rivada bid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We had to reformat with other shareholders,&quot; said Rivada's Ganley, who said the group's financing also had to be quickly retooled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;There were some inexplicable obstacles that rose from [partner bank] Banamex at the last minute,&quot; Ganley told The Post. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rivada submitted its bid on Oct. 20, with an asset- backed corporate guarantee for $250 million and later, on Oct. 31, submitted a letter of credit from BBVA, a Spanish bank. The SCT said the completed bid missed the deadline. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Rivada claims under Mexican law governing private/public partnerships, if the deficiency isn't fatal the SCT was obligated to consider it, &quot;and not throw someone out over a technicality,&quot; Ganley explained to The Post. &quot;The law is about having competition for these things.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l  Ganley claims Rivada's bid boxes were robbed by a mystery motorcyclist just days before the bid was due. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The motorcyclist grabbed the boxes from a female employee, Ganley said. Fortunately for Rivada, the boxes did not contain the bids.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to its legal arguments, Rivada said the Alt&aacute;n bid shouldn't have won because it is backed by Chinese technology. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That should make the US uneasy, Ganley said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alt&aacute;n, backed by Morgan Stanley, the World Bank and the Chinese investors, is said to use technology from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-based Huawei, according to Rivada. That Chinese technology is being used just across the US border, Ganley says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;My understanding is they plan to use Chinese technology,&quot; the CEO said. &quot;That would never be allowed in the US.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alt&aacute;n is backed by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mexico Fund, which has 23.36 percent stake in Alt&aacute;n. Industry sources say that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mexico Fund is a limited partner and that the group has not yet selected tech providers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Adding even more intrigue to the spectrum auction, one Alt&aacute;n adviser has been accused of murder. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Early in the process, the adviser, British telecom expert Richard Alden, was forced to quit the Alt&aacute;n team after he was arrested on suspicion of murdering a woman last year in Kenya. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The woman was found dead at his home. Alt&aacute;n acknowledged on a call with Morgan Stanley last week that Alden had been on its team. The arrest stunned the Rivada team. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The family of the dead woman is asking that charges be dropped. Alden has pleaded not guilty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In response to Rivada's lawsuit, the SCT has hired powerhouse New York law firm Jones Day,  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The SCT, meanwhile, is threatening to sue Ganley.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We all need to make sure that those who are thinking of investing in Mexico [know] not only that it has courts that work, [but] that they hold everyone to the highest standards,&quot; Ganley said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alt&aacute;n, in response, said that things are much simpler than they appear. Rivada Networks &quot;didn't present the bid bond when required by the rules detailed in the tender process.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rivada is pressing its suit because Alt&aacute;n is expected to sign the spectrum deal within days. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alt&aacute;n Group says its rivals are just sore losers who simply didn't follow the rules of the bid process.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It has been a competitive process and compliant with Mexican law and practices in international tender process,&quot; a spokeswoman told The Post. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As for Thiel, he must be hoping this latest trip to court is as successful as his last. The billionaire bankrolled Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker that ended with a Hogan victory. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thiel did not return calls for comment. catkinson@nypost.com </SPAN></P>
