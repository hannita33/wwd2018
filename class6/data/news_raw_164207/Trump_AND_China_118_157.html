<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Chinese are coming to publishing.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  International Data Group, the company founded by the late billionaire Pat McGovern, has sold the majority stake to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oceanwide Holdings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Following McGovern's death in 2014, the company was controlled by its investment arm, IDG Capital, which counts Accel Partners and Breyer Capital as limited partners.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It generated proceeds for the McGovern Foundation on brain cancer research. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oceanwide is headed by billionaire Lu Zhiqiang. At one point, IDG Capital and Oceanwide were bidding against each other for the publisher. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But at the suggestion of Goldman Sachs, which represented IDG, the two decided to do a combined bid. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hugo Shong, the IDG Capital boss and a longtime IDG executive and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of McGovern, is expected to be named chairman of the new joint venture, sources tell Media Ink.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Under McGovern, the publisher of PCWorld, Macworld and CIO Magazine expanded to publish more than 200 magazines worldwide - most now available only in digital format.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After its founding as a data company in 1964, IDG grew into an international behemoth with more than 60 titles in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> alone. It also has a joint venture with Hearst to publish the Chinese versions of Cosmo, Esquire and Harper's Bazaar. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Terms of the deal were not disclosed, although Reuters had previously reported that IDG was in talks to sell itself to an undisclosed Chinese buyout firm for $500 million to $1 billion.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The deal for IDG marks just the latest excursion by deep-pocketed Asian buyers into US media. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Forbes Media was taken over in 2014 by Integrated Whale Media, controlled by Hong Kong financiers Yam Tak-Cheung (aka TC Yam) and Wong Siu Wah (aka Sammy Wong), along with Singapore businessman Wayne Hsieh.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then in November, Guggenheim Partners sold Dick Clark Productions for $1 billion to Dalian Wanda Group, the world's No. 1 cinema owner, controlled by billionaire Wang Jianlin.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beckman lands </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Richard Beckman, who exited as chief revenue officer at Vice Media last year, has landed at Discovery-backed Group Nine Media, parent of Thrillist and other sites, as its chief revenue officer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Discovery, the cable-TV powerhouse, announced in October that it was putting $100 million into the company controlled by Lerer Hippeau Ventures and headed by Ben Lerer.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It includes Thrillist, The Dodo, Seeker and the news and entertainment site NowThis.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The move seems aimed at getting video producers more into the long- form video game, rather than being an old-fashioned traffic play.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The company boasts that it's already the No. 1 video news publisher on Facebook. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We have a combined 4.2 billion video views per month,&quot; Beckman said. &quot;These are video views - not impressions. It shows engagement - and engagement is replacing reach for the sake of reach.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beckman also joked that the &quot;Mad Dog&quot; nickname he picked up when he was an up-and-coming executive at Cond&eacute; Nast - and which stuck with him as CEO at Prometheus Global Media and co-founder of the now defunct Three Lions Entertainment - is being usurped by Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pick for Defense secretary, James &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Mattis.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I've had it for more than 20 years,&quot; he said in mock indignation, &quot;but I think my real title should be Alchemist, formerly known as Mad Dog.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Time-tremor </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Time is shuffling the deck again, although this week's shakeup, which has 30 people heading for the exits, is not seen as quite as big a jolt as the earthquake that hit last July, eliminating all publisher jobs.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among those who are exiting the company - either through job eliminations or early retirement packages - are executives who were handed promotions only seven months ago: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l Charlie Kammerer, who was president of news, business, sports and lifestyle </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l Christine Wu, senior vice president of advertising strategy and marketing </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l Andy Blau, senior vice president and chief business officer </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l Rick Simmons, senior vice president of automotive  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l Ron King, senior vice president of fashion/style, multicultural and shelter </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l Chris Grdovic, brand sales director of luxury and a former publisher of Travel &amp; Leisure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   In the latest moves, Greg Schumann and Karen Kovacs were each elevated to the rank of group presidents, sales.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kovacs, a former People publisher, will oversee food/beverage, beauty, and entertainment/style. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Schumann, who was overseeing pharmaceuticals, will be in charge of auto, financial services, government/industry, home and technology/telecommunications. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Susan Parkes-Cirignano, formerly in People public relations, become senior vice president, advertising and brand marketing.  </SPAN></P>
