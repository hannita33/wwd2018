<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After a weak year, Wall Street is flexing its muscles.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America reported solid fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, buoyed by a trading frenzy in the wake of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  JPMorgan Chase beat expectations with a 24 percent increase in profit, to $6.73 billion from $5.43 billion during the same period a year earlier. Net income totaled $1.71 a share, beating analysts' estimates of $1.43. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  JPMorgan shares rose 0.5 percent, to $86.70. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chief Executive Jamie Dimon made a pitch during a Friday conference call for the deregulation of Wall Street, arguing that the Obama-era rules had held back economic growth.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;No rational person that I know could possibly say that all the things done were accurate, coordinated, consistent, proper and made it a safer system,&quot; Dimon said on a call with journalists. &quot;It's time to take a look at that. I hope the new administration does.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Brian Moynihan, Bank of America's chief executive pushed a narrative of &quot;responsible growth&quot; during a conference call.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Profit was up 43 percent on a nearly $1 billion cut in non-interest expenses, as $19.9 billion in revenue missed analysts' expectations.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bank also projected it would buy back about $1.8 billion in stock during the first half of the year.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The optimism for positive change here at BofA and among our customers is palpable and has driven prices higher,&quot; Moynihan said during the conference call. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BofA shares were up marginally to $23.01.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The final three months of 2016 were a roller coaster of major financial events, with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election sparking a trading frenzy and the fallout from Wells Fargo's fake-accounts scandal taking hold.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The year started with one of the sector's worst quarters ever as stocks cratered on plummeting oil prices and weakness in the Chinese economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While JPM and BofA had a lot to cheer about, not everyone on Wall Street did so well. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Friday was the first earnings announcement for Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan, who stepped into the role in October after John Stumpf buckled under intense pressure to resign in the wake of the bank's fake-accounts scandal.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It wasn't good. The bank's profits slipped 5.4 percent, to $5.27 billion, or 96 cents a share. Analysts expected a buck a share.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We continued to make progress in the fourth quarter in rebuilding the trust of our customers, team members and other key stakeholders,&quot; Sloan said in a statement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite the lukewarm earnings, Wall Street sent Wells shares up 1.5 percent, to $55.31.  </SPAN></P>
