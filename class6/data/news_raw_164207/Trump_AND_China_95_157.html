</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear John: The election was surprising, but not shocking. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What was surprising was the overwhelming number of people who voiced their alienation with the status quo. I believe it was a repudiation of the far left drift the Democratic party has taken under Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was also the politicization of federal departments and agencies - the IRS, Justice Department and State Department. And the fudging of numbers by Commerce and Census to put forth a narrative of economic wellness.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was a media that was more lapdog than watchdog, and a university system that resembles day care for the infantile politically correct. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I did not vote for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. I could not in good conscience vote for either of them. But I believe this outcome was not so much a vote for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as it was a vote against the road we've been traveling. What do you think? G.C. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear G.C.: The only thing I disagree with is your first sentence. This was shocking. It was, in no small sense, a revolution at the voting booth. And it will reverberate for decades, not just years. Historians will write about it.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And politicians for generations will be talking about the defeat of Hillary Clinton - who almost everyone considered a sure thing - by Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the way people now look back to Ronald Reagan. I'm not saying </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be as good, although I do hope he will fix all our problems.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I, too, think this was a rebellion against the way the country has been going, but for the past 16 years. The ill-conceived wars that raised the national debt, the catering to the financial markets and Wall Street at the expense of everyone else.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The media? The performance of what is known as the &quot;mainstream media&quot; was an absolute disgrace. And it could be the turning point that leads to people seeking even more of their information through internet sources that aren't as tied up emotionally and financially with big corporations that have political agendas.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THIS COUNTRY IS A BORROWING FOOL </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I agree with much of your &quot;Not a Going Rate&quot; article, but the $20 trillion debt figure is very misleading. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over $4 trillion is in the lock box that never existed. The US tripled payroll taxes in the mid 1980s in order to generate - at the time - over $200 million in surplus tax revenue that was, of course, spent on other parts of the federal budget.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those surpluses gradually shrunk to the point where there were no more, and now the US government borrows to fund both Social Security and Medicare.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The $4 trillion (that we borrowed from ourselves) does not really exist, only the future obligations for these plans. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There are also $2.5 trillion of US Treasury securities that have been purchased by the Federal Reserve as part of the various quantitative easing programs. Once again, the Treasury owes the Fed that money, but in reality it does not exist, except on paper. And I assume if the Fed holds these securities until maturity, they will then disappear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I am no big fan of QE and would have preferred the genius Ph.D.s could have avoided the financial crisis in the first place, as opposed to coming up with ever more creative ways of supposedly saving the economy, but I digress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Basically, $6.5 trillion of the debt is on paper owed to ourselves. Try to mention that next time you discuss this issue. B.B. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear B.B.: All debt is &quot;future financial obligations.&quot; We don't have to repay the trillion bucks that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lent us by purchasing our bonds until, in the case of 30-year bonds, three decades from now.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It doesn't mean we can ignore that debt obligation until the Chinese come knocking. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Same with Social Security and Medicare, from which you correctly state we've borrowed close to $5 trillion.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As for QE, that's a whole different animal. Yes, the Fed bought trillions of dollars of government securities. But nobody really knows what happens to those securities in the long run. Will the US Treasury have to pay the Fed back? Probably not. Will those bonds just disappear into thin air? Maybe, but that would be like having printed $2.5 trillion in new money, which could be deemed hyper-inflationary by the markets and the rest of the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No, sorry, the real amount of US debt - as I type - is $19.8 trillion. And the interest payments on that debt alone is $485 billion a year.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Let's not dance around the issue just to make ourselves feel better. But thanks for expanding the discussion.  </SPAN></P>
