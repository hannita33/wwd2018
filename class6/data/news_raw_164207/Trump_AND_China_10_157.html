</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   I know that by now I'm supposed to anoint Hillary Clinton as the next president - and give up on the crazy notion that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will win. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And I'll say it again. I don't care who wins. I don't like either, although I find someone as crooked and careless as Hillary more troublesome than a pig like Donald. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And while most (all?) of the media has written off </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the mogul hasn't said or done anything stupid in days and he's neck-and-neck with Hillary in some big polls and gaining in others. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And then there's this. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We've seen a lot of hacked e-mails from others that have been damaging to Hillary but none of her e-mails. Unless someone puts the kibosh on the release of Hillary's personal e-mails - which we know were stolen - there could be a lot of very damaging things coming out about her between now and Nov. 8. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I think she's set up for an ambush. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So, I thought today would be a good column to discuss what might happen to various financial markets if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should win.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I know, I know. Some of you are shaking your head and saying, &quot;That ain't gonna happen.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But humor me.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here's what you might expect from the first 100 days of President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  n  Because of the media's obvious strong bias toward Hillary, the election of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would cause a shock similar to the one that was supposed to happen when Britain decided a few months ago to leave the European Union.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This Brexit, as the British pullout is known, wasn't supposed to happen - at least if you believed polls that were just as one-sided then as the ones in our presidential election now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So the stock market could quiver if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is elected, especially shares of media companies that could suffer a presidential vendetta. And multinational firms that could be hurt, too, if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> keeps his pledge to redo trade agreements. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Companies that do business in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mexico could suffer the most, because those countries have been special </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> targets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Defense companies will benefit because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has vowed to boost the military. And materials and construction companies will also be helped because of his proposals to rebuild the country's infrastructure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The stock market as a whole, however, could get banged hard, at least for a few weeks or months. That's the same prediction many made after the Brexit vote, but the markets were just fine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But there's a difference now. After Brexit, the German government, the European Union and perhaps others intervened to keep the financial markets steady.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> moves into the White House, he probably won't get that kind of help - at least not right away - from the central bank or Wall Street.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He's feuding not only with Federal Reserve Chair  Janet Yellen - who he thinks has been incompetent - but also with Wall Street. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said that the stock market is very overpriced.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So Wall Street might try to teach president-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a lesson by letting the market collapse a bit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  n   The bond market is more dangerous than the stock market. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Everyone already agrees that the Fed will soon raise interest rates. But the financial markets might not wait for the Fed if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is elected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both Hillary and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have vowed to spend more money to get the economy going. The problem is that the US already has $20 trillion in debt. So any additional spending will get people worrying about inflation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And inflation worries will cause interest rates to rise. And rising rates automatically mean bond prices will fall.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rising rates also mean that the federal deficit will go up because Washington - like everyone else - will have to pay more to borrow money. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election would bring another uncertainty into the bond market equation. He's already shown his disdain for Yellen, and there have been reports that she doesn't plan to leave that post if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is elected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A fight for control over the Fed - while the dream of every columnist - would be tough on bond investors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  n  Oil prices will decline if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is elected - good for consumers, not so good for investors in the stuff. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's straightforward. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has vowed to pump as much oil as possible in the US and make the country even more energy self-sufficient. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  n   You have to be very sophisticated to invest in the US dollar. But in the end, it either goes up or down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The minute </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wins, the dollar will react to his threats regarding trade deals. This is all very tricky, but here's how it was explained to me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Because the US has a trade deficit, our dollars end up in the hands of other countries. To be safe, those countries hedge - essentially buy insurance - against a decline in all the dollars they have accumulated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wins and the dollar starts to fall, all those countries holding massive amounts of our currency will have to buy dollars to cover their shorts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So the dollar could rise if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is elected - except if foreign investors see him as a possibly reckless leader. Then the dollar will lose its value as a &quot;safe haven&quot; in an otherwise unpredictable world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trumping the economy </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is gaining in the polls, and an anti-Hillary Clinton November surprise is still expected. So if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wins on Nov. 8, here's what investors could expect: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Stock markets could get banged hard - temporarily </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Defense companies will benefit </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Oil prices will decline </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * The dollar could rise </SPAN></P>
