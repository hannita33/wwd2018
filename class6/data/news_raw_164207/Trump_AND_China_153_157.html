<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear John: My daughter was the victim of a scam recently.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She had listed a water heater that we were selling on letgo.com. The buyer said he would be sending a check for more than the amount of the listed price of $350, and asked her to distribute various amounts to others. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   I thought this to be suspicious and did some research, and came up with similar information as you recently did when you played along in an internet fraud attempt.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I received the check at my work address, as I did not want to provide the buyer with our home address. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   I have attached the check and the notes my daughter received. It's sad to think there are people out there who actually are scammed by these disgusting creatures.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hopefully, more people will be made aware by your recent article, and the people running these scams will be stopped and punished! R.O. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear R.O.: There are many lessons here. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  First, nobody sends you more money than you deserve - except your mom and dad (and in some families, even they can't be trusted). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So if someone comes up with a convoluted method of paying you for a good or service, there is something amiss, and don't get involved.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Second, don't ever let anyone near your house if you are selling something. And certainly don't let anyone in your house! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And if you do sell something, don't take personal checks. They may as well be written on Charmin. Demand cash - and even then you can't be sure it's not counterfeit. Thanks for sharing this.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear John: I read your article about that internet scam with great interest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  My daughter got involved in a similar scheme, and we actually took the material we received to the local police station. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the police aren't interested in solving these crimes. They said not to cash the check. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We asked if they wanted the &quot;evidence,&quot; but they were not interested. So no wonder these guys continue to scam people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Best regards, E.S. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear E.S.: In fairness to the cops, what can they do? These guys might be somewhere in Africa, and local police just don't have that kind of reach or resources.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Educating the public to these scams is really the only defense. And that's what my column intends to do - although I have to take credit for doing it in an entertaining sort of way.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So don't cash the check. And unless you are trying to have some fun at the scammers' expense, don't contact them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'TIS THE SEASON TO BE DRIVING UP OIL </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear John: I enjoy your columns. But it looks like the oil traders are spoiling your prediction that gas prices would stay low. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Feb. 1 in suburban Philadelphia, regular gas was $1.91. This morning it is $2.39.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obviously, Brent crude has really jumped up. Who is doing it? I have read of no shortages on the world market. B.S. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear B.S.: Yes, gasoline prices are up, and I take it personally that speculators are trying to make me look bad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But this is the start of the famous peak driving season, a built-in seasonal excuse to drive energy prices higher despite the supply-and-demand factors in the marketplace.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yes, there is still too much oil and gasoline out there. And, yes, the US economy barely expanded in the first quarter, and hardly grew in the fourth quarter of 2015. So there is no reason that traders should be predicting an increase in demand. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic growth is slowing. Japan is in the pits. Europe is a mess, and technology is making cars more fuel efficient.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So all speculators have to count on is the peak driving season. When we learn that driving isn't peaking, prices go lower. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the bigger problem is that Washington is not reining in speculation in essential commodities like oil. And nobody in the media - except me - points out that these jumps in oil prices are the result of Wall Street greed. If Wall Street speculators were forced to take physical delivery of the oil represented by the contracts they buy, we'd either have lower prices or a lot of barrels stacked in backyards in Greenwich, Conn.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So my next prediction is for oil to go back down sharply and quickly this summer. And it will become an issue in the presidential campaign after Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gets nominated. In fact, that's an issue that could get him elected. </SPAN></P>
