<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear John: My troubles with Con Ed started back in October 2015.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I made my October payment using Con Ed's pay-by-phone service, as I have been doing for years. Everything went smoothly, and I received a confirmation number. Then, in November, I received a notice from Con Ed stating that it never received the funds from my bank, JPMorgan Chase. I checked my balance, and had more than enough funds to cover it. This also happened with November's Con Ed bill.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I called Con Ed and spoke to one of its customer representatives, who told me it was having trouble with Chase releasing funds payable to Con Ed due to a new payment system that it had installed during the summer, and that I should go to my bank and tell it to release funds to the account of Con Ed of NY. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I went to my Chase branch located at 1901 86th St. in Brooklyn, and spent more than an hour with the branch manager. She made many calls to her tech people, who didn't know of any problems or what to do with the account info that I had been given.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She also made calls to Con Ed and seemed to get only the runaround. Con Ed did tell her my pay-by-phone privileges had been suspended for five months for nonpayment.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On March 9, 2016, I mailed the current bill along with a check for $1,613, the total amount owed, at the Bath Beach post office. The next month, I received a new bill for $1,826, and again sent a check for the total amount, mailed at same post office. I would greatly appreciate any help you can give with this matter. C.K.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear C.K.: I checked with Con Ed and didn't get the runaround. And while I didn't get a definitive answer, I'm sure your problem is now being fixed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokesman for Con Ed said &quot;We are in touch with the customer and seeking to resolve the matter.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added that &quot;several payments the customer tried to make failed, prompting us to put a block on the account. Once we removed the block, the payments still did not go through.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The spokesman said that &quot;based on what we have learned so far, we do not believe the problem is with Con Edison's systems.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, that's what they all say. But hopefully it's fixed by now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Addendum from C.K.: I want to take this opportunity to thank you for all your help in solving my payment problems with Con Edison. It's your intervention that got ConEd to assign Ms. Rodriguez to be my personal troubleshooter. Thank you again. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear John: Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aggressiveness was learned from a very close business associate and friend.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is interesting to note that infamous Roy Cohn was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawyer, mentor and friend for many years. Much of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arrogance, brazenness and insulting aggressiveness is right out of Cohn's personal playbook.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was Cohn who brought </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into NYC's elite political circles and represented him in lucrative real estate deals. Once one knows the great influence Cohn had on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it is not hard to recognize it in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> actions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Those brazen actions could be his downfall but for what awaits Hillary in October in e-mails to be exposed and the movie &quot;Clinton Cash.&quot; M.M. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear M.M.: Thanks for the background. It's going to be interesting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear John: If the increasingly erratic Federal Reserve decides to shell out &quot;helicopter&quot; money, I don't think it would cause much of a jump in inflation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's because if &quot;free money&quot; caused a big increase in consumer demand, all it would do is ramp up some of the thousands of Chinese factories now sitting idle.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There's so much slack in the world economy that it would take an enormous dump of free money to make a difference. E.K. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear E.K.: OK, if you are correct, it would then increase the US trade deficit and allow </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to accumulate trillions of dollars.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Chinese would then hold those dollars in the form of US Treasurys, making it ever a bigger creditor and giving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which doesn't particularly like us, more control over American policy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Or it could just cause inflation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Either way - and there are numerous bad outcomes - a money dump would not be good for the US, especially coming as it does after the QE policy that has created excess currency.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thanks for the exercise in hypotheticals.  </SPAN></P>
