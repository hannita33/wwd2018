</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear John: I just read your response to a letter about your recent column on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump, China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and tariffs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I agree with you, except for your take on the situation that exists between ourselves and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - &quot;You'd be out on the street pretty quickly,&quot; you said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not so, sir, we've got them right where we want them financially.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All we have to do to ruin them is renege on our debt, which quite possibly we might do anyway. So they'd better not anger us. T.D. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear T.D.: Seriously, that's your interpretation of how the world of finance works?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I compared the US' situation with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to that of a tenant/landlord. We owe </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lots of money, and as such we've reduced the amount of flexibility we have in demanding things from that country.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You suggest that we just renege on our obligations to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What happens even before that decision - when such a move is just rumored - is that the US will suddenly have to pay considerable more to borrow money from everyone. And - this is no small matter - we'll have to find investors willing to take </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> place at the table. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The value of US bonds will collapse - as rates rise because of the new risk in owning them - and pension funds, municipalities, the Social Security &quot;Trust Funds&quot; and everyone else holding American bonds will get clobbered. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I believe you might want to rethink your position on this.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There's an old saying that goes something like this: &quot;If I owe you $100, I'm in trouble. If I owe you a million dollars, you are in trouble.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's the situation here. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> owes us plenty - and we are in trouble. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear John: Wouldn't the simplest way for the Labor Department to determine how many jobs were created or lost month to month be by using Social Security FICA payroll deductions paid to the system, since everyone is required to make those payments, especially employers? C.F. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear C.F.: You would think that would work, wouldn't you? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But then every bureaucrat who works on the Labor survey and everyone who works at the Census Bureau going house to house would be out of a job. And it would probably be considered a sin for the government to actually save money on these surveys. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CAN'T BE SCHOOLED ON SUMMER JOBS </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear John: I attended Hudson Valley Community College and Brockport, a SUNY college, between 1966 and 1969. I can't remember how much I paid, but I earned all the money I needed for tuition, books, room and meals by working summer jobs.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That is, mid-June to mid-August. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I will bet my income against your income that a kid today can't do that. B.R. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear B.R.: I'm not going to take your bet - not only because I can't afford to put my salary on the line but because I agree with you.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even if college expenses were only $10,000 a year - which they aren't - how could any kid make that kind of money (legally) in today's economy?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  College costs, helped by easy-to-get student loans, have far outpaced other expenses over the years. Eventually college costs will need to come into line with reality, or a lot of schools will be going out of business and a lot of kids will be denied a college education. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And - this is very important - many kids and their families will make a very reasonable decision that jobs in the trades (plumbers, electricians, carpenters, etc.) aren't so bad after all.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I know that a lot of my salary these days is going to people who can fix things around my house that I can't. A lot of days, I wish I had entered one of those professions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Look, I graduated from college in 1973 with very little debt, thanks to generous family members - and working summer jobs.  </SPAN></P>
