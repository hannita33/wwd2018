<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last week Nancy Reagan's close friend told me: &quot;She's seeing nobody. I can no longer visit. Too frail. Can't even telephone. Our last conversation the voice was so weak I barely heard her.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ronald Reagan and my husband headed sister theatrical unions concurrently. Reagan, president of SAG, the Hollywood movie colony's Screen Actors Guild. Joey, president of AGVA, New York's American Guild of Variety Artists, which monitored Sinatra to Elvis to circus pros, every performer who worked live. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They were friends. I have photos from when Joey escorted brand-new President Reagan to the New York Post newsroom to walk around, meet its staff.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nancy became a dominant personality - before haute couture, red dresses, astrology, children's quarrels, buying White House </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">china,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asking California's previous governor to quit the mansion quickly so she could move in. I remembered her first day as first lady. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We were in Poland. Joey had Reagan's California home number and tried placing a congratulatory call. No operator. I jiggled the phone. Waited. No operator. We went downstairs to complain. Hotel manager: &quot;Sorry. She's not working now. It's food time.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;But we're calling the president of the United States!&quot; Manager: &quot;Yes. But sorry. It is her food time.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After chewing her Polish ham sandwich, the Communist operator placed our call. Nancy answered. The first words we heard from the first day of the first lady was her first shout: &quot;Honey, it's for you.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New York yak </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  FORMER Sen. George Mitchell, 2016 St. Patrick's Day Parade grand marshal, to Ray Kelly, grand marshal of 2010's St. Pat's Parade, &quot;Tips?&quot; Kelly: &quot;Comfortable shoes&quot; . . . LE Cirque table talk: Come summer Christie's will prep Joan Rivers' Connecticut estate auction . . . GOV. George Pataki: &quot;The presidential election's still early. Maybe someone emerges. Maybe somewhere we get another Abraham Lincoln.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Odds &amp; ends </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CATE Blanchett to an interviewer: &quot;I'm tired of talking about Cate Blanchett. Can't we talk about something else?&quot; . . . STUFFING yourself at great Italian places like Campagnola you hear things. Come August Bill Clinton hits 70. Win or lose, never mind election, a big party's being planned . . . BERNIE Socialist. (Note the B.S. initials. Same odor as Pres. B.O.) I just felt like mentioning that . . . CBS-TV's Rolls-Royce of news magazines, &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; rolls right along. After Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, son of Pierre Trudeau, the country's most colorful PM since the Ice Age, exec producer Jeff Fager's scheduled the president of Argentina. Lesley Stahl's sit-down is March 20 . . . Amy Schumer's GQ fantasy: &quot;In a hibachi restaurant Tracy Morgan makes me laugh until I can't breathe.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Friends help on a very ruff day </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WALKING dog-centric New York I'd meet 15 or 20 sporting furs, cashmeres, booties. Ralph Lauren's shop gave my Yorkies three sweater fittings. Maybe since we live longer, or lonelier minus loved ones, or impersonally because work is via cells, computers, pets became part of us. Family. They're little people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last Tuesday when I lost Jazzy, Ivana sent her dog Tiger </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> picture. E-mails, phone calls, letters, more flowers than at Gotti's funeral from dog owners Carolina Herrera, Randy Levine, Melissa Rivers, Buffy Cafritz, Caroline Hirsch, Joanna Mastroianni, Judy Wilpon, Dr. Rock Positano. I can't remember names right now. My eyes fill with tears. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But thank you . . .  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A GOODYEAR Blimp had a problem over a recent caucus. Seems the Republicans ran out of hot air. </SPAN></P>
