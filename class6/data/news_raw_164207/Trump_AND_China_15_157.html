<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> scored a stunning and historic upset victory in the presidential election Tuesday night, once again defying predictions and winning key battleground states to capture the White House. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Giddy supporters at the New York Hilton - who were sullen just hours earlier - erupted in cheers as the GOP nominee closed in on victory, chanting, &quot;President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; &quot;Drain the swamp,&quot; and &quot;Lock her up!&quot; about Hillary Clinton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The celebration grew wilder still when TV monitors showed people crying at Clinton's party at the Jacob Javits Center. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ed Rollins, who ran </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Great America Super PAC, basked in the victory. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We won the presidency, the Senate and House. When's the last time that happened?&quot; Rollins told The Post. &quot;The polls were bad! </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is going to be president. He's won this thing. He caught the wave of public discontent and rode it. Washington has to be stunned.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I'm feeling great,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ally Rudy Giuliani told The Post as he strode into the party. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;If I can think of an analogous election, it would have to be Andrew Jackson. This is the people revolting against the Republican establishment,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Associated Press called the election for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at 2:29 a.m. Wednesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   In a tweet posted earlier that night, Clinton seemed resigned to what had to be a heartbreaking upset after working for years to become the first female president in the nation's 240-year history. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Whatever happens tonight, thank you for everything,&quot; she wrote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Supporters were equally downbeat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lena Dunham, the outspoken Clinton backer and &quot;Girls&quot; actress, was asked to comment about the election results as she left a Clinton VIP party at around 10:45 p.m. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I'm sorry, not tonight,&quot; Dunham told The Post.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Somewhere, [Vladimir] Putin is laughing manically,&quot; another Clinton supporter said as others broke down in tears. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Neera Tanden, a Clinton confidante whose blunt e-mails were among those released by WikiLeaks, was spotted leaving the Javits Center at 11:05 pm. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked about the results, Tanden said: &quot;I've been through a lot of battles with her, and I've seen her come out strong.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked about gloomy numbers coming out of Michigan and Wisconsin - blue states that are key to Clinton's survival - Tanden said, &quot;We'll see how it goes.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I honestly feel a piece of my soul died,&quot; said Katie Larson, a 25-year-old musician living in Manhattan. &quot;We lost a piece of our dignity as Americans.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reaction around the nation and the globe was muted as people digested the shocking upset. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;After Brexit and this election, everything is possible from now on. A world collapsing before our eyes. Dizzying,&quot; tweeted Gerard Araud, French ambassador to the US. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chinese state media described the election as the embodiment of America's democracy in crisis in contrast to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stability under authoritarian rule. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The state-run Xinhua News Agency said the campaign highlighted that &quot;the majority of Americans are rebelling against the US's political class and financial elites.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Argentine Foreign Minister Susana Malcorra said a win by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the US election would stall recent moves to improve relations between the countries.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She said the &quot;more closed, isolationist and xenophobic&quot; model represented by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would have a negative impact on the world and relations with Latin America.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Silicon Valley bigs also freaked out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shervin Pishevar, co-founder of the venture-capital company Sherpa Capital, which helped fund Uber, Airbnb and Slack, tweeted that if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wins, he would start funding a campaign to allow California to secede from the US and form a new country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hollywood lefties were also slack-jawed and angry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Xanax,&quot; Mia Farrow tweeted.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Putin's gonna win this thing,&quot; Sarah Silverman wrote on Twitter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Before the polls closed, betting markets and national polls all gave Clinton the edge. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as the results dripped in, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prediction earlier in the day took new prominence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think a lot of the polls are phony,&quot; he had said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mood among Team </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had soured after Clinton widened her lead in the polls following FBI Director James Comey's announcement Sunday that he would not be pursuing criminal charges over her email server. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the candidate remained upbeat.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I will be watching the election results from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in Manhattan with my family and friends. Very exciting!&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweeted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did well in the South and Midwest, while Clinton ran stronger in the Northeast, easily winning New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and Massachusetts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By 11 p.m., sales at the New York Hilton party's cash bar were brisk as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prospects looked less grim. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's looking &quot;good&quot; for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, George W. Bush's former strategist Mark McKinnon said inside the filled ballroom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think this is really a significant movement,&quot; added Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Alabama), one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> biggest boosters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fans weren't declaring victory. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked what he was drinking tonight, the conservative Sessions said water. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I need every brain cell available,&quot; he said, adding that he anticipated getting grilled by the press. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, stock futures cratered, plunging 700 points at one point, and bonds rallied as the outcome of the election remained unclear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nervous traders questioned whether Clinton could win as expected. The Mexican peso fell sharply against the US dollar, reflecting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bellicose warnings of tariffs and determination to build a wall along the southern border. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I would say the market is a bit more cautious as it doesn't seem to be such a quick and decisive victory for Hillary as it seemed,&quot; Ian Lyngen, head of US rate strategy at BMO Capital Markets, told CNBC. &quot;But it's not over, yet.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton had the lead in most national polls heading into the election and in enough battleground states to get to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Additional reporting by Carl Campanile and Post Wire Services </SPAN></P>
