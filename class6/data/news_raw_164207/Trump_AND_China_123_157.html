<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Democrats cheered President Obama's speech for Hillary Clinton last week, and rightly so: It was a stem-winder. Too bad those same delegates also roundly rejected his last major initiative - the Trans-Pacific Partnership. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;No TPP&quot; signs were some of the most common on the convention floor, and the party platform strongly opposes the treaty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton came out against TPP (which she'd long favored) during the primaries as she moved left to fend off Bernie Sanders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet Democrats have been moving against free trade for decades now. In remarks to New York delegates last week, Sen. Chuck Schumer - who in January takes over as Senate Democratic leader - recalled how he'd turned down then-President Bill Clinton's personal entreaty to support NAFTA back in the 1990s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, Obama needed lots of Republican votes to even get the authority to negotiate the final TPP treaty - which he considers vital not only to boosting the US economy but to building a stronger Pacific alliance to contain </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dangerous regional ambitions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He's absolutely right - which is why we've always backed him on this issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Democrats still refuse to support the president on TPP, while GOP nominee Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been bashing it from the start of his campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  None of this means it's dead: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> insists he's not anti-trade; he just wants to negotiate deals that are better for America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe - a TPP supporter and close Clinton ally - caused a stink mid-convention by suggesting that a President Hillary Clinton might flip back to supporting the deal with a few cosmetic changes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Clinton camp went all-out to deny McAuliffe's claim. Whether you believe that, we suppose, depends on how much you trust Hillary - who's going to have to abandon at least a few of her current promises if she's going to have an economic-growth agenda. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It would help, of course, if the president made a real effort to change Democratic minds on the issue. </SPAN></P>
