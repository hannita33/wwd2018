<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  O.J. Simpson. May his tripe decrease. His body's behind bars but his alibi keeps escaping. Sunday, on cable's Investigation Discovery, Martin Sheen narrates the new six-parter &quot;Is O.J. Innocent? The Missing Evidence.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Interviews with Nicole Simpson's and Ron Goldman's families. Investigators reopening the case. Supposed facts overlooked. Updated forensics, DNA data, weapon examination. Hourlong what-might-have-really-happened episodes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's got a forensic psychologist, police sergeant, investigator probing what's labeled &quot;new&quot; evidence: content from the infamous Bronco, blood spatter, potential eyewitness, etc. And, this being your lucky day, even America's best houseguest Kato Kaelin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beginning Denmark and Sweden, this docu-thing then plays in 130 countries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I've done hundreds of mentions, articles, Page Ones dealing with this 20-plus-year-old horror. I knew the players. I knew of the drugs. I reported prostitutes claiming he'd abused them. I named those involved hustling book publishers. November '94, I wrote, &quot;Nicole said she knew O.J. would eventually kill her.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  About this disgusting, horrific, awful, repulsive Simpson I can barely speak. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now they're sorry </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While reporters kvetch more about Russia than America, Joe Biden saying, &quot;Stop already, it's over,&quot; has made those canceling DC's longtime historic inaugural party now feel guilty. &quot;We should've given </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a chance. We should've given the party. Sorry we didn't,&quot; they told me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Getting kudos from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And while masses pack tuxes for ballrooms and boots for parades, our &shy;Emperor-elect remains a calm presence. Receiving baseball commissioner Rob Manfred, our almost president was reminded of when Manfred's young boy hit a hole-in-one at a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> course and Donald left his golf cart to tell the kid, &quot;Great shot.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What that other emperor, Caesar, talked about before running to fix up Rome - this I don't know. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Party for pandas a priority </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rep. Carolyn Maloney's into panda-monium. As reported, she's committed to getting a panda in NYC. Her Feb. 7 Black and White Panda Ball here, complete with black and white confetti, will be an annual fund-raiser. She says the governor, mayor, IRS, not-for-profit whoevers, even the Chinese ambassador support the idea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And how does Central Park feel about housing it? &quot;We need to get approval.&quot; And the Bronx Zoo feel about having it? &quot;They're into gorillas. They don't want it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All dressed up </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Amy Adams attended an event wrapped in a stunning short, black lace dress. Who's is it? &quot;Marchesa,&quot; she said. &quot;But it's borrowed for the night.&quot; Also with gorgeous diamond earrings. Who gave them to her? &quot;They're loaned to me for the evening.&quot; Her feet walked in stunning black ankle-strap platform heels. And their particular history? &quot;Part of my own rotating wardrobe. I take them out for special occasions, then put them right back.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Channel changes </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New York's favorite local station NY-1 - with New York's favorite anchors, reporters, weather alerts, subway info, showbiz openings, breaking news, interviews, chats - has undergone a cosmetic change. Signage and background's prettier. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A little management shift is also causing a little staff nervousness. Forget having a Ford in their future. Familiar faces are now worrying they may not have a mike in their future. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Housekeeper to lady employer: &quot;Our neighbor is not as beautiful as you.&quot; Employer: &quot;What about without all my makeup on?&quot; NYC housekeeper: &quot;Then she's just as beautiful.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Only in New York, kids, only in New York. </SPAN></P>
