<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tony Kushner, Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright for &quot;Angels in America,&quot; Spielberg's screenwriter for &quot;Lincoln,&quot; is now adapting Mimi Baird's book &quot;He Wanted the Moon&quot; for Plan B, Brad Pitt's production company. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It's about institutionalizing then lobotomizing Baird's bipolar doctor father. This brilliant medical star studying manic depression began a memoir until he himself descended into madness. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;In the '20s and '30s, mental illness was in the closet. Not spoken about. It was psychiatric hospitals, electric shock and never coming out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Brad liked my writing, and we've talked of a few things. So he asked if I'd read this and would I consider adapting it. The tragic story moved me. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;My problem is a bad habit of researching for years. Like I took seven to investigate Lincoln. I can't do that again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Researching mental illness now I have seen awful, haunting, disturbing mental hospitals with iron bars. During WWII, 50 percent of all hospital beds were these cases. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;My first draft is due mid-May. Once I start, I write fast. My best energy's in the morning. Depending how late I've been out, I can wake up, start writing and go around the clock. At the end when characters come to life, you can go and go. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Jack Kerouac pasted together long scrolls of paper. My writing's terrible. My first draft's with a fountain pen - old ones with the gold nib. They're flexible and make big strokes. But that's just for me. Then it gets to the computer.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Odds &amp; ends </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Runaround </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  KNOW why our Department of Education is effed up? Chancellor Fari&ntilde;a burbles she's eager for an interview and oh-what-a-wonderful-idea-and-let's-do-it then takes no phone calls and ducks reporters so she has more time to junk up schools. Says yes yes yes then her p.r. or deputy or whoever apparently makes up excuses and says they're Ohboyohboy doing it. Try to ask them something? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You cannot. Do not trust her. Do not trust them. Home-school. I'm telling you what I know. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bits &amp; pieces </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  RUTH La Ferla's Sunday NY Times piece. Great Sally Field interview despite trashing me just a teeny bit . . . NYC designers: &quot;Lead time's needed to produce couture. Sizes differ. But before our clothes leave the runway, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> knocking us off.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  LiLo's all groan-up </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  LINDSAY Lohan: &quot;The word 'kid' made me feel like a child. Some date called me 'kid.' I hated it.&quot; Yeah, well, at 29, she no longer has to worry . . . NOBODY's rushing to Europe this summer. The rental push is on for the Hamptons. Asking $200,000 for a nice - not special, just nice - place . . . A heavily bearded Mandy Patinkin's in concert May 23, National Yiddish Theater. Tickets $150. Listen, it's cheaper than the Hamptons . . . ALSO coming, Black Lab Theatre's bleak comedy &quot;Crude.&quot; Stars Nico Tortorella. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  COP killers, apprehended after escape from a Texas penal institution, were called the Texas Seven. So which is scarier? The Texas Seven on the loose? Or Texas Sen. Cruz, who hates NYC, in the White House? </SPAN></P>
