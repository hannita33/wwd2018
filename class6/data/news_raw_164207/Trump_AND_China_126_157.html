<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hillary Clinton wrangled a fat $12 million donation from the King of Morocco last year in exchange for her scheduling and attending the annual summit of her family foundation's Clinton Global Initiative in that country - but she never showed up despite pocketing the cash. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Top Clinton aide Huma Abedin bluntly said in a November 2014 e-mail that the ex-secretary of state would attend the May 2015 summit in Marrakesh at the behest of Moroccan King Mohammed VI. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;No matter what happens, she will be in Morocco hosting CGI on May 5-7, 2015. Her presence was a condition for the Moroccans to proceed so there is no going back on this,&quot; Abedin wrote to top Clintonista Robby Mook. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In another e-mail, Abedin warned that if Clinton didn't attend the summit, the $12 million would be off the table, and that Clinton &quot;created this mess and she knows it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Just to give you some context, the condition upon which the Moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation. If hrc was not part if it, meeting was a non-starter,&quot; Abedin wrote in a January 2015 &shy;e-mail to Mook and campaign manager John &shy;Podesta. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;CGI also wasn't pushing for a meeting in Morocco and it wasn't their first choice. This was HRC's idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request. The King has personally committed approx $12 million both for the [foundation's] endowment and to support the meeting,&quot; Abedin continued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It will break a lot of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">china</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to back out now when we had so many opportunities to do it in the past few months. She created this mess and she knows it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The king gave the money to the Clinton Foundation and underwrote the CGI summit with the quid-pro-quo understanding that Hillary would attend, and other dignitaries attending were led to believe that she would be there.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Hillary sent Bill and Chelsea Clinton to represent the family while she campaigned in Nevada and California. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was unclear how much went directly for the summit and how much went to the Clinton Foundation - but the total added up to $12 million, according to the e-mails. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Guests at the May 2015 GCI summit - which was closed to the media - stayed at the five-star Selman-Marrakesh hotel, a posh lodging featuring a stable of Arabian horses and luxury amenities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The meeting was officially paid for by OCP, a Moroccan-government-owned mining company that has been accused of human-rights violations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Clinton supported the monarch when she was secretary of state, and the US-financed Export-Import Bank gave OCP a $92 million loan guarantee during her tenure, The Daily Caller reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Politico reported in 2015 that Clinton &quot;was seen by [Morocco capital] Rabat as among its staunchest supporters in the Obama administration.&quot; The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice charged OCP with &quot;serious human-rights violations,&quot; including exploitation of workers by not &quot;adequately compensating the impoverished people who live there,&quot; the Daily Caller said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Mohamed Yeslem Beisat, the Washington envoy for the self-described &quot;government in exile&quot; Polisario Front, told US News &amp; World Report in April 2013 that &quot;OCP is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation - it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past 40 years.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;They're doing this because they know Hillary has some chances of being president of the United States. And they want her to support their brutal occupation of Western Sahara,&quot; Beisat told the magazine at the time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Human-rights advocates have called the company's mined phosphates &quot;blood phosphates&quot; - similar to the term &quot;blood diamonds,&quot; referring to precious stones mined in war zones and/or used to finance deadly conflicts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The e-mail was among more than 4,000 posted Thursday by WikiLeaks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The e-mails were stolen from the account of Podesta, now Hillary-campaign chairman, who has warned that the communications may have been doctored. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  US intelligence agencies have fingered the Russian government as the culprits behind the hack - charging that Russian President and Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporter Vladimir Putin was trying to influence the US election in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> favor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Wednesday's final presidential debate, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> insisted - without offering evidence - that &quot;no one knows&quot; who hacked the &shy;e-mails. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton slammed her opponent for using the purloined e-mails to attack her, as well as his past statements encouraging the Russians to hack her own e-mails from when she was secretary of state. </SPAN></P>
