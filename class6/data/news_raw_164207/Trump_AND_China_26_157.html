</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He came, he saw, and he changed the world. Mostly for the worse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Barack Obama enters the twilight of his reign of error, he is still doing things his peculiar way. A craven deal to bring Iran's mad mullahs in from the cold, a visit to Castro's Cuba, hugs for nuclear survivors in Hiroshima.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At home he is shutting down coal mines and throwing open America's borders and schoolhouse bathrooms. He rarely bothers to pretend that Congress matters anymore, with every executive action a headline-grabbing dare to the courts to stop him.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Each day brings a new notch on the legacy belt as he appears determined to do things just to prove he can. History will sort the wheat from the chaff, but the short-term impact of Obama's eight years can be summed up in two words: &shy;Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama begat </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Without Obama's mixture of breathtaking arrogance and stunning incompetence, there is no constituency or emotional space for a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A year ago, that would have been a preposterous claim. Yet at this remarkable juncture, with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> having secured the GOP nomination, it all seems obvious now. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the inevitable reaction to the blundering Obama colossus.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I say that not because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the most likely of all Americans to fix what Obama broke, though he will have to try. Rather, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in his own peculiar way, is Obama's doppelganger.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both are radicals. Obama's radicalism is revealed through his policies, while </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is revealed through his personality. They are as different as night and day, yet they are like two sides of the same coin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama voters got the president they wanted - 51 percent of the country still approves of his performance. Now the other half seems determined to have its Big Daddy president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policies remain a mystery, but that's hardly a first for a nominee. Obama was not the unifying president he vowed to be, with a poll in his first term finding that 54 percent of the country thought he was far more liberal than anticipated. The people were right - he leaves the Democratic Party far, far to the left of where it was eight years ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it's more than Obama's extreme partisanship and identity politics that paved the way for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. It's also that Obama solved no serious problems facing the country, and turned some into full-blown disasters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He doubled the national debt, the economy is stuck in neutral, and instead of cooling race relations, he turned them into a bonfire - the bonfire of Obama's vanities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nor is it incidental that the world is on fire. By abdicating America's leadership role, Obama created the vacuum that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Russia and &shy;malignant forces everywhere are rushing to fill. Could anyone possibly do worse? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, of course, still must vanquish Hillary Clinton to complete the pendulum's full swing. Polls showing the race tied reflect the nation's mood, but the Electoral College is what matters, and Dems hold a clear advantage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2012, with 270 electoral votes needed, Obama got 332 to Mitt Romney's 206. Recent polls showing a dead heat in three key swing states - Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio - pointed a possible path to GOP victory.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While neither </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nor Clinton is trusted and liked by a majority of Americans, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advantage is that he is the far better candidate and generates wild enthusiasm. Clinton is a dud on the trail, and her e-mail scandal, compounded by the inspector general report showing she's been lying to the public all along, makes her baggage almost unbearable. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But beyond the Electoral College advantage, Clinton has a better organization than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Her campaign and super PACs are way ahead in fund-raising and ad buys, while </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can't make up his mind about how much money he'll need and how to get it. His firing of a top aide reveals a continuing &shy;turmoil that should have been &shy;resolved by now.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All things considered, Clinton enters the summer as the front-runner for the general election. Although Bernie Sanders is still scrapping for the nomination and the FBI has not had its say, she's likely to survive both challenges.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the only Republican who could beat her, but it won't be pretty. Because he's a street fighter and her tenacity is as strong as her character is crooked, the squeamish should turn away now. A brutal slugfest is guaranteed. </SPAN></P>
