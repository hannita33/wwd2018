<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WASHINGTON - President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans to nominate retired Gen. John Kelly to take over the Department of Homeland Security, putting three generals in place to take high-powered civilian posts in the new administration.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kelly told Fox News on Wednesday that he had &quot;been asked and would consider it an honor.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If confirmed by the Senate, Kelly would be in charge of the agency tasked with securing borders against illegal immigration, protecting the president, responding to natural disasters, and counterterrorism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Kelly is believed to hold strong views on stopping illegal immigration. The four-star general told a congressional committee last year that the lack of security on the US-Mexico border represents a national security threat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kelly, a Marine, served most recently as head of US Southern Command.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He is the most senior member of the military to have lost offspring in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Kelly, 66, left the military earlier this year. An official announcement is expected next week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Other former generals selected by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are retired Gen. Jim Mattis, to head the Defense Department, and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, to serve as national security adviser. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team also announced Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as the next ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Branstad received the job offer directly from the president-elect Tuesday at a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower meeting, aides said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Branstad faces a delicate task because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has already ruffled diplomatic feathers by taking a phone call from the president of Taiwan, which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> considers to be its territory. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In other transition news, Linda McMahon was picked to run the Small Business Administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McMahon, the former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment and wife of WWE mogul Vince McMahon, ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate from Connecticut in 2010 and 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt will take charge of the Environmental Protection Agency, a source told The Post. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pruitt, who was elected in the 2010 Tea Party wave, has filed lawsuits targeting the EPA and the environmental policies of the Obama administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The left is going to hate him in the EPA. They definitely don't want Pruitt, a rule-of-law guy who relishes a fight,&quot; said a source close to Pruitt. The source added Pruitt's not going to wreck the agency, saying, &quot;He wants to mend it, not end it.&quot;   With Reuters </SPAN></P>
