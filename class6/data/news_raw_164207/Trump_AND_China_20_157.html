<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> launched a searing attack on Hillary Clinton on Wednesday, slamming her as &quot;a world-class liar&quot; who &quot;may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency of the United States.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Speaking deliberately and reading from a teleprompter at his Soho hotel, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hammered Clinton as a failed secretary of state who can't be trusted on issues ranging from Middle East turmoil to immigration and trade. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to ISIS, the barbarians. Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East and on the road to nuclear weapons,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said to a crowd of about 50 in the made-for-TV event. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Hillary Clinton's tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign-policy disaster after another,&quot; he said, speaking in a moderate tone. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The uncharacteristically disciplined speech was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first major address since shaking up his campaign in what promises to be a brutal battle for the White House. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It also came as the billionaire businessman faced growing questions about his readiness not only for the presidency, but for the race he will need to run to win given his bare-bones campaign operation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Team </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hoped the carefully scripted speech and modulated delivery would quiet those concerns and rally Republicans around their fierce opposition to Clinton.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Clinton Foundation was a prime target for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said the former first lady used her career in public life to get rich by cutting deals with brutal foreign regimes that then donated millions to her family's foundation or paid for Bill Clinton's speeches. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft,&quot; he charged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund doing favors for oppressive regimes and many others and really many, many others in exchange for cash, pure and simple,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He specifically took aim at the Clintons for raking in millions from Saudi Arabia and other countries that criminalize homosexuality. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   As president, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> added, Hillary would be controlled by Wall Street, CEOs and foreign governments who paid the Clintons to give speeches over the years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;They totally own her and that will never, ever change,&quot; he charged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also accused Clinton of giving &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> millions of our best jobs and effectively let </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> completely rebuild itself. In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During the 45-minute speech, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pledged to &quot;appoint judges who uphold the Constitution,&quot; reform the nation's immigration policies and repeal ObamaCare. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continued with a laundry list of charges against Hillary and the Obama presidency - including the failure to maintain the country's infrastructure while making trade deals that cost American jobs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;When I see the crumbling roads and bridges or dilapidated airports or factories moving overseas to Mexico or other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed but not by Hillary Clinton, only by me,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also appealed to Bernie Sanders' supporters to back him - and repeatedly questioned the presumptive Democratic nominee's honesty. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Hillary Clinton, most people know, she's a world-class liar. Just look at her pathetic e-mail server statements or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack and the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total lie. This was one of the beauts,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The crowd included </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York campaign co-chair Carl Paladino. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I thought it was awesome. Donald let go all of the guns!&quot; Paladino gushed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton, speaking in North Carolina, said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was peddling &quot;outlandish lies&quot; and &quot;reckless ideas that will run up our debt and cause another economic crash.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attacks, she said, were an effort to distract people from the issues. &quot;That's why he's attacking my faith. Sigh,&quot; she said, referring to his comments a day earlier questioning her Christianity.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With AP </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * &quot;Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * &quot;ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made along with President Obama.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
