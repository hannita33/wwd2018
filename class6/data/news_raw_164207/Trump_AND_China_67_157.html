<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WASHINGTON - It was full bore ahead Wednesday for Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team, which announced Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as the next ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while a third retired general was expected to be named to a top national-security post. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Branstad received the job offer directly from the president-elect at a meeting between the two on Tuesday in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower, aides said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The diplomatic posting will be a busy one since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has already unsettled diplomatic norms by taking a phone call from the democratically elected leader of Taiwan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Iowa governor has had a relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping since 1985, when he visited Iowa on a cultural exchange. Branstad has visited the Communist country four times in the last seven years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Governor Branstad's decades of experience in public service and long-time relationship with President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders make him the ideal choice,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in a statement.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Retired Gen. John Kelly was expected to take over the Department of Homeland Security, making a trio of generals to have high-powered civilian posts in the new administration. Retired Gen. Jim Mattis was named Tuesday night to be the next secretary of defense, and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn was appointed weeks ago to serve as national security adviser. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kelly, a Marine, served most recently as head of US Southern Command.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He is the most senior member of the military to have lost offspring in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Kelly left the military earlier this year. An official announcement was said to be coming next week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In other transition news, Linda McMahon was picked to run the Small Business Administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McMahon, the former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment and wife of mogul Vince McMahon, ran unsuccessfully for US Senate from Connecticut in 2010 and 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt will take charge of the Environmental Protection Agency, a source told The Post. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pruitt, who was elected in the 2010 Tea Party wave, has filed lawsuits targeting the EPA and environmental policies of the Obama administration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The appointment will be sure to frustrate President Obama and his allies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The left is going to hate him in the EPA. They definitely don't want Pruitt, a rule-of-law guy who relishes a fight,&quot; said a source close to Pruitt. The source added Pruitt's not going to wreck the regulatory agency. &quot;He wants to mend it, not end it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
