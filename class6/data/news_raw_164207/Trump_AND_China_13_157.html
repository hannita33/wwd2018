<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The eye of a storm is a calm place surrounded by turbulence. So is Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Much of liberal America is in an absolute tizzy over his impending presidency, with denunciations and declarations of defiance competing for the most apocalyptic scenarios. Will the world end Friday or Saturday? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The sturm und drang is not limited to the homefront. Europe is reeling from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> salvo that Brexit is a &quot;good thing&quot; and NATO is &quot;obsolete.&quot; And </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> threatens to &quot;take off the gloves&quot; if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> keeps flirting with Taiwan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But if the president-elect is rattled or even worried about the turmoil, he's doing a masterful job of concealing it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   When I visited his Manhattan office Monday, he was more zen than elevator music. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Days from his inauguration, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the calmest man in America. Smiling, gracious, making jokes, laughing at mine, tossing off asides to an aide - if you didn't know what he's been through and the awesome responsibility he's about to assume, you never would have guessed it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To be sure, he was hardly oblivious or giddy. It was the holiday for Martin Luther King Jr. and the papers were filled with stories of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dispute with civil-rights icon John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat. Lewis started the row by saying he would boycott the inauguration because he sees </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as an &quot;illegitimate president,&quot; which is a shockingly cheap shot.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet, predictably, most journalists hammered </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> counterpunch, a tweet that said Lewis &quot;should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart.&quot; Predictably again, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was accused of being racially insensitive to a black hero on the day that honors Martin Luther King Jr.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;So unfair,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, referring to The New York Times' tilted story, which led the front page. &quot;It's really dishonest.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His tone was more matter-of-fact than outraged, and it occurred to me that this was in contrast to his Twitter personality, which gives the impression that he is almost always angry. The platform might serve him better if he used it more often as a happy warrior.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  My personal experience with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is limited, but I have known many public figures who would have spent days curled in the fetal position if they had taken half the pounding he's endured the last 18 months. Even a single false accusation of racial insensitivity would have sent most to the medicine cabinet and the bottle.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then there's that new life </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> starts Friday at noon. Maybe it hasn't hit him yet, but he shows no sign of being intimidated about becoming the most powerful man in the world, #45 in the line that starts with George Washington and includes Abraham Lincoln, FDR, JFK and Ronald Reagan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He showed some spark when he mentioned his meeting with the head of Lockheed-Martin about the soaring cost of the F-35 aircraft. I asked if it was true the company had offered $600 million in reduced costs. He nodded yes and said, &quot;We saved $600 million in half an hour's work.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At that, I said I'd like to ask some questions I'd prepared, figuring they would light his ire.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I started with President Obama's latest poison pill, of having the Justice Department investigate FBI Director James Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton probe. I asked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> if he would push to have the inspector general widen the review and examine all the evidence, including whether Clinton should have been indicted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We have not gotten into that yet,&quot; he said calmly, before saying Comey had treated Clinton &quot;extremely well&quot; by not recommending criminal charges.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I then raised the prospect of his being tested soon after taking office, saying it's almost a ritual that each new president gets tested by a foreign adversary. What do you expect and from where? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As I mentally raced through possibilities, he cut my speculation short. &quot;I don't think we're going to be tested,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm not a game player. They understand me.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What about Iran, I said, thinking it was a likely source.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It's a terrible deal,&quot; he said. &quot;Frankly, it's worse for Israel than it is us, but it's terrible.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? &quot;It will all be fine&quot; he started benignly, before switching to the trade deals he pledged to fix or scuttle. &quot;We have a big problem with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; he said, more emphatically. &quot;They've been sapping our wealth through these horrible, horrible trade deals. Everybody takes advantage of us, but the trade deals are just so bad.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At that point, Peter Thiel, the entrepreneur and philanthropist, walked into the office, and after brief bantering, I stood up to leave. I wished </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Godspeed and walked out, uncertain of what I had learned.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later, it hit me - I had witnessed something important and wonderful. Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a man at peace with his responsibility. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The next leader of America is standing strong in a world gone mad. Tested by fire, he is calm, confident and ready for action as he approaches his rendezvous with history. May God smile on his tenure.  </SPAN></P>
