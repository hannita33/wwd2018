<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama claimed Friday that he went mano-a-mano with Vladimir Putin over Russia's meddling in the US election, telling the strongman to &quot;cut it out&quot; and warning of &quot;serious consequences&quot; if he didn't. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;In early September, when I saw President Putin in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that [meddling] didn't happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be serious consequences if he didn't,&quot; Obama said in full John Wayne mode. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;And, in fact, we did not see further tampering of the election process.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a cascade of leaked e-mails swiped from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton aide John Podesta continued to flow from WikiLeaks right up to Election Day - so it's unclear what effect Obama's comments to Putin accomplished. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Obama patted himself on the back for dealing with the issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think we handled it the way it should've been handled,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;My principal goal leading up to the election was making sure that the election itself went off without a hitch,&quot; he said, adding that he accomplished that goal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not everyone agreed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Clearly Putin was not impressed by Obama threat in September to cut it out or face consequences,&quot; Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) tweeted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;There would be no strong Putin without a weak Obama,&quot; he added in another tweet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tony Shaffer, a retired Army lieutenant colonel who exposed intelligence failures before 9/11, dismissed Obama's talk as &quot;vapor.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He has really not set anything up for action,&quot; Shaffer said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama indicated Putin knew about the e-mail hackings, noting the Kremlin does little without the leader's approval. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin. The Russians were responsible for hacking the DNC,&quot; he said during the year-end news conference.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has dismissed talk of Russian hacking as &quot;ridiculous&quot; despite the intelligence community's near consensus that it occurred.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his remarks Friday, Obama took a harder a line with Russia than he did when the country invaded Crimea, shot down a civilian passenger jet, hacked the White House and bombed Syrian civilians in alliance with the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama also expressed bewilderment over Republican lawmakers and voters who approve of Putin.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Obama slammed Russia's backward economy and authoritarian government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The Russians can't change us or significantly weaken us. They are a smaller country, they are a weaker country, their economy doesn't produce anything that anybody wants to buy except oil and gas and arms,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said he felt &quot;responsible&quot; for the suffering in Syria but defended his decision to avoid serious military action there, saying it was &quot;impossible to do this on the cheap.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, he pinned the bulk of the blame on Russia, as well as Iran, for propping up Assad. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;This blood and these atrocities are on their hands,&quot; he said shortly before leaving on his annual Christmas vacation to Hawaii. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama weighed in on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision to speak with the leader of Taiwan, a phone call that broke decades of US diplomatic protocol. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He advised </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to &quot;think it through&quot; before altering the US policy of recognizing Taiwan as part of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  With Post Wire Services </SPAN></P>
