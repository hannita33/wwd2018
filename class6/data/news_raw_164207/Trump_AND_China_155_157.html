<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With Osi Umenyiora, it was always about speed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Be the first off the ball with a jet-like first step. Be first to strike in engaging the offensive tackle. And, most importantly, be the first to the quarterback, the first to swipe down on arm and separate ball from hand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So much of Umenyiora's NFL career was based on speed. How ironic that his life out of shoulder pads and cleats is all about patience and waiting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I had no idea the amount of work, to see all the stuff you have to do in order to get something like that to happen,'' Umenyiora recently told The Post. &quot;If I was to see that happen that would be tremendous. It would be crazy.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tremendous and crazy are merely two of the sentiments attached to Umenyiora's assigned project: Settle an NFL team in the United Kingdom. Not for a one-game visit, akin to the road trip the Giants successfully completed in their Week 7 victory over the Rams, but an NFL team permanently based out of London. This is something the league wants and the league usually gets what it wants. And Osi Umenyiora, former Giants pass rushing defensive end, has been tasked to help make it happen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It's a perfect role for him,'' said Jerry Reese, the Giants general manager, who took Umenyiora in the second round of the 2003 NFL Draft and admits he is one of his favorite picks and players. &quot;He's got his boots on the ground. If anybody can get it going it'll be Osi.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is not an official title, but Umenyiora is working for the NFL as a special ambassador in the United Kingdom. He spent 12 years as a player, amassing 75 sacks (and two Super Bowl rings) in his 10 years with the Giants - he is in the team's Ring of Honor - and 10 more sacks in his last two years with the Falcons. Umenyiora lives seven or eight months in London and the other months in Atlanta. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;They're trying to get it to a point where I'm here in London full time,'' he said. &quot;We'll see how that goes.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is a labor of love. Umenyiora was born in London and spent the first seven years of his life there before his family moved to Nigeria and later to Alabama, where he went to high school and began his ascent in football. He now lives in the Notting Hill section of London with his 9-year-old son, T.J., and wife, Leila Lopes - the former 2011 Miss Universe representing Angola. Umenyiora resides about 20 minutes from his childhood home in the Golders Green section. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Umenyiora, 34, adores the city of his birthplace. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It's a wonderful city, outside of the weather,'' he said. &quot;It's truly incredible, the people are so together, it's cool. No violence, or very little violence, people aren't running around here with guns, you just feel safe walking around. It's a real cool city. No </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over here.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Giants and the NFL brought Umenyiora back to London in 2007, for the first time since he was 7, for the first-ever International Series game, won by the Giants 13-10 in the rain at Wembley Stadium. &quot;I remember the game was horrible, it was terrible,'' he said. &quot;But the experience was great.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The experience stayed with Umenyiora and forged his belief the NFL overseas could work. The NFL reached out to him after his retirement following the 2014 season and a unique role was born. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Umenyiora works for the BBC as part of NFL-themed TV shows on Tuesdays (review of what took place the previous weekend) and Saturdays (a look at the upcoming games). For the Giants-Rams game, Umenyiora was up in the booth at Twickenham Stadium, providing analysis during the time outs and breaks - the BBC does not go to commercials during games. By all accounts, he is a natural, keeping his comment loose and lively. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think he's a great guy,'' said Neil Reynolds, a British NFL studio host on Sky Sports, a competitor of the BBC and of Umenyiora. &quot;I interviewed Osi when I was working on Sky Sports, loved watching him as a player and I think he's got a real future as a broadcaster. People always reach out to me on Sky and say 'Oh, we watch on BBC, we're not watching on Sky' and I say 'Absolutely fine, Osi's got you taken care of because he does a great job.' '' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reynolds and Umenyiora collaborate for NFL event promotional work; in the summer they teamed for a six-night NFL cavalcade starting in Scotland and ending in the south coast of England. It is all about growing the NFL in the soccer-mad, rugby-loving, cricket-watching U.K. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Can it happen? There are three games in London this season - the Redskins and Bengals finish up this year's series on Sunday - and possibly a fourth added next year. Mark Waller, the NFL's executive vice president of international, said there will be 40,000 fans attending all three of this year's NFL games. That is a reasonable season-ticket holder base, in the minds of the NFL. In addition to Wembley and Twickenham, a brand-new state of the art soccer stadium in Tottenham will be completed in 2018 and the NFL is already booked to play there. It will be in the 60,000-seat capacity range - ideal for what the league is looking for overseas - and will be NFL-ready, with all the necessary bells and whistles, including a retractable football field that can slide in and replace the soccer pitch. If the NFL lands permanently in England, it will be in Tottenham. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If that day ever comes, Umenyiora's fingerprints will be simple to detect. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He's fantastic,'' said Waller, who grew up in Africa, went to boarding school in Wales and works for the NFL out of New York. &quot;It's such a great thrill for us to have him. He's doing fantastic. He's doing fantastically on the BBC. He's become quite a figure and that was always the goal when he came over, we wanted him to have the chance to be the face of the sport with our broadcast partners. The last time I saw him he was very happy.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He is happy, and also a realist. Cracking a robust sports market is tough. The day after the Giants-Rams game, The Sun newspaper in London splashed Chelsea's 4-0 beatdown of Manchester United on the back page. What followed were six full pages of Premier League coverage and then pages of Grand Prix racing and graded horse race entries. Buried 11 pages into the sports section - the very last page - was a small picture and six-paragraph story that called the Giants' 17-10 victory at the famous rugby facility &quot;a snoozefest'' that &quot;was not a game to convert fans of the oval ball to gridiron.' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not exactly blanket coverage of an NFL game that attracted a sellout crowd of 74,121. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I feel like they're so traditional in what they like over here,'' Umenyiora said. &quot;The kids like it, actually the kids love it, but it's the older generation fighting to hold onto their values and their traditions. So it's a constant battle trying to promote the game and trying to put it out front and center. It would be similar to another game coming into America and trying to take on American football. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We're trying to position the NFL as the new cool young sport. The younger generation really likes it. But it's been a battle, no doubt about it.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If anyone can win the battle, those who have seen him in action believe Umenyiora is the man to lead the charge. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Having someone like Osi here, he's got that British background, won two Super Bowls, likes to talk about how he beat up Tom Brady, it's all great for the fans   they actually can see it, touch it and feel it,'' Reynolds said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;This is his neighborhood, he knows about it, and he's just such a good and such a charismatic person and caring person, it's a great role for him,'' Reese said. &quot;I can see him being the president one day, what do you call him [in England]? The prime minister, I could see him in that kind of role, an official office.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Umenyiora laughed at that suggestion - &quot;Jerry's so funny, man'' - and realizes some players - perhaps a majority - would be skeptical of living in London and playing for a team based on foreign soil. He said he would advise players, &quot;It's not going to be a huge amount of time in your life so take advantage of it, experience something different, make money for you and your family, let your family experience something different and don't be so closed-minded and be all 'No, no, no, I got to stay here.' It's a great place, man. Experience life. It's not like you're playing in the middle of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You're in London.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his head, Umenyiora knows &quot;the NFL has put so much money into it, they've invested so heavily into London.'' In his heart, he believes &quot;if we continue with the path we've been on for the last couple of years I think there eventually will be a franchise here.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If that day ever comes, he joked (or maybe not) he wants to be the general manager of the London team - or perhaps attain an even a loftier goal. Osi Umenyiora, NFL commissioner in the U.K.? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;That,'' he said, &quot;would be real cool.'' </SPAN></P>
