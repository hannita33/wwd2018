<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bill and Hillary Clinton &quot;are the people responsible for turning the Democratic party into the party of Wall Street and their glitzy friends&quot; going back 25 years, writes Jill Abramson in The Guardian. She recalls covering Bill in 1991 &quot;at one of his early Hollywood shakedowns . . . He loved schmoozing with rich people, [and] his body language literally changed as he mixed with the ultra-rich.&quot; That same crowd - &quot;fundamentally at odds with the party's egalitarian message&quot; - expected &quot;their $1.2 billion infusion to catapult Hillary Clinton back into the White House and were astonished, like the rest of the country's elite, to see all that money go down the tubes.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ex-pols: For an Emerging New Centrism </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Former Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Utah ex-Gov. Jon Huntsman (R), writing at Real Clear Politics, say calls for change won't be realized if we see &quot;compromise as a sin, pragmatism as a character flaw and common ground as a foreign country.&quot; Those who &quot;promise good times forever if we only agree with 100 percent of their ideas 100 percent of the time&quot; will only produce &quot;gridlock, not progress.&quot; With more voters &quot;starting to identify as moderate and independent,&quot; there's a new center &quot;that in Washington seems drowned out by the left and right but is larger than either of them.&quot; Behaving as &quot;one people with differences of opinion&quot; who are &quot;willing to compromise&quot; will &quot;make America great again. In fact, that's how America became great in the first place.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Foreign desk: Benefits of Freewheeling Diplomacy </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> isn't even president and he's already wandered into two foreign-policy crises, warns David Ignatius in The Washington Post. &quot;His freewheeling style seems to have discombobulated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which has some unexpected benefits. But on Russia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is on his back foot.&quot; He &quot;created some useful ambiguity&quot; by &quot;daring to raise the unmentionable topic of Taiwan&quot; and &quot;the Chinese aren't used to such ambiguity&quot; from Washington. Senior US officials suggest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;disregard for precedent . . . reckless as it may appear, may open up possibilities for US diplomacy,&quot; especially after &quot;eight years of prudent and predictable&quot; Obama policy. But &quot;this is a high-risk strategy, which may create consternation among allies even as it enhances deterrence of adversaries.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mideast watch: Perils of a Jerusalem Embassy </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is promising to move the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and, unlike previous presidents, &quot;looks like he's going to keep his word,&quot; notes Eli Lake at Bloomberg. But while this &quot;would help discredit those who seek to delegitimize Israel . . . it is nonetheless just a symbol.&quot; Some fear a risk to &quot;Israel's quiet relationships in the region&quot; with Arab states and &quot;violent protests&quot; in neighboring Arab countries. One Israeli diplomat warns: &quot;It will overshadow the increasing cooperation on the security side, and it will make it harder to come out of the closet with this cooperation, which is in Israel's interest.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the right: Useless Lawsuit vs. Social Media </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The families of three men killed in the Orlando nightclub by jihadist Omar Mateen are suing Facebook and Alphabet (Google and YouTube), claiming they &quot;did not do enough to keep the Islamic State and sundry Muslim radicals from using their platforms to recruit and inspire such acts of savagery.&quot; This, says Kevin Williamson at National Review, because &quot;the nerds who run Facebook and Google have billions of dollars at their disposal, no sovereign immunity and no proclivity for cutting off the heads of those who oppose them.&quot; But &quot;good luck collecting on a judgment&quot; against ISIS or Iran. &quot;Lightening Mark Zuckerberg's wallet is not going to do very much to improve that,&quot; however, and &quot;might create a precedent that would damage free speech and free enterprise.&quot; - Compiled by Eric Fettmann </SPAN></P>
