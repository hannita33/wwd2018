<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> delivered his &quot;closing argument&quot; to the presidential election in historic Gettysburg, Pa., on Saturday, invoking Abraham Lincoln as he vowed to unite a divided country and set it on course with a series of policies he intends to put in place during his first 100 days in office.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The populist wish list - a push to set a presidential, policy-driven tone for his campaign's final 17 days - included tax cuts, term limits, school choice and regulatory reform in a speech he called &quot;a contract between Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the American voter.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Change has to come from outside our very broken system,&quot; said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who lags behind Hillary Clinton in most national polls and ended another bruising week during which he refused to say he would accept the election results.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pledging to &quot;drain the swamp&quot; of Washington, DC, he said he would fight for a constitutional amendment to limit congressional terms and to trim the fat from the federal bureaucracy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;For every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated,&quot; he told a crowd of about 500 in a ballroom at the Eisenhower Hotel and Conference Center. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also said he would bar White House and congressional employees from taking lobbying jobs for five years after leaving government service and would freeze federal hiring. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A seven-point list of economic promises included his stump lines on renegotiating NAFTA and labeling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a currency manipulator and a new pledge to pull billions of dollars for UN climate-change efforts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;My economic plan will create at least 25 million jobs in one decade,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He touted tax relief, promising middle-class families with two children a 35 percent tax cut and vowing to reduce corporate taxes from 35 percent to 15 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also said he would thwart big media mergers, like the deal for AT&amp;T to buy Time Warner, &quot;because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few&quot; - and because the media is part of the &quot;rigged system&quot; aligned against his campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The media is trying to poison the mind of the American voter,&quot; the tycoon charged. &quot;Deals like this destroy democracy.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To &quot;restore security and the constitutional rule of law,&quot; he said he would immediately repeal executive orders issued by President Obama, deport criminal undocumented immigrants and restrict immigration through &quot;extreme vetting.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We want people who love our country or who can love our country,&quot; he said. &quot;There are ways of determining that.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he was honored to speak on &quot;hallowed ground&quot; at the center 4&sup1;/  miles from where Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address in 1863.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;President Lincoln served in a time of division like we've never seen before,&quot; he said. &quot;It is my hope that we can look at his example to heal the divisions we are living through right now. We are a very divided nation.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton's campaign was unimpressed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;This speech gave us a troubling view as to what a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State of the Union would sound like - rambling, unfocused, full of conspiracy theories and attacks on the media, and lacking in any real answers for American families,&quot; said spokeswoman Christina Reynolds.  </SPAN></P>
