<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tech stocks on Monday got whacked for a fourth straight day as investors braced for a possible trade war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> under a Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A get-tough strategy with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could lead to stiff tariffs being placed on products imported from that country - hurting sales. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tech giants like Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet are down sharply since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nov. 8 victory. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Apple shares bore the brunt of the downdraft on Monday, falling 2.5 percent, after a government-controlled newspaper in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warned that &quot;iPhone sales will suffer a setback&quot; if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> follows through on campaign threats to &quot;wreck&quot; US-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade relations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The NYSE-listed shares of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant led by billionaire Jack Ma, were also battered, falling 3.5 percent - and are down more than 10 percent since Election Day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Apple selloff came despite pleas from analysts that the iPhone maker, which holds more than $230 billion in cash overseas, could be the biggest beneficiary of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposal to dangle tax breaks for companies looking to repatriate their holdings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shares of Amazon - whose billionaire boss Jeff Bezos had joked before the election about using one of his rockets to send </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into space - lost 2.7 percent Monday, to close at $719.07. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That capped a losing streak that has left Amazon down 8.7 percent since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election - a bloodbath that slashed nearly $6 billion from Bezos's paper wealth, leaving him with just $62.9 billion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Elsewhere, shares of Facebook and Google parent Alphabet may have gotten slammed simply because they were tech stocks, as money managers dumped them to chase more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-friendly sectors, including banks, pharmaceuticals and defense. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It appears to be a bit of a rotation among sectors,&quot; said Kevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also hard hit were Tesla Motors and SolarCity, whose proposal to merge is coming to a vote later this week.  </SPAN></P>
