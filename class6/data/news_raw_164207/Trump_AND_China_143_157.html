<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wins the White House on Tuesday, he'll be only the second United States president born in New York City. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So while you're waiting for a National Historic Landmarks plaque to go up on his childhood home at 85-15 Wareham Place in Jamaica Estates, Queens, go visit the birthplace of the one president born and bred in New York City - Theodore Roosevelt. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An imposing brownstone at 28 E. 20th St. marks the birthplace of our 26th president. Roosevelt, who was born on Oct. 27, 1858, lived here until 1872. The house is a near-replica of the original, which was torn down in 1916. When T.R. died in 1919, a group of rich society ladies raised money to rebuild the house, stocking it over the years with furniture and decorations donated by family members. The blue </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">china</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the living room was a gift of Eleanor Roosevelt, T.R.'s niece. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Theodore was a sickly child who spent most of his time with his nose in a book. His father famously said to him, &quot;You have the mind, but you haven't got the body. To do all you can with your mind, you must make your body match it.&quot; So his father set up gymnasium equipment on the second-floor porch, and this is where 12-year-old Teddy began to bulk up. You can see the stepladder he used to crawl out the window to get to his gym. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The house, now a museum run by the National Park Service, recently underwent a $3.7 million renovation. It contains plenty of T.R. memorabilia, including the shirt he wore during an assassination attempt in Milwaukee in 1912. The bullet was slowed by a 50-page speech he had in his coat pocket. The speech, punctured by the bullet, is also on display. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the dining room hangs an engraving of &quot;Lady Washington's Reception&quot; that depicts the Founding Fathers, including Alexander Hamilton (also founding father of the New York Post). These days, when tour guide Russel Fershleiser points him out, tourists ooh and ah. Such is the popularity of &quot;Hamilton&quot; that A.H. is upstaging T.R. in his own home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Presidents have been darting in and out of NYC since the time of George Washington. As a general, he famously bid farewell to his officers at Fraunces Tavern on Pearl Street in 1783, telling them while fighting back tears, &quot;With a heart full of love and gratitude, I now take leave of you.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Every president since Herbert Hoover has stayed at the Waldorf Astoria on Park Avenue (although since Chinese investors bought the hotel, President Obama has stayed elsewhere during NYC visits). The presidential suite is on the 35th floor and, it's said, is equipped with high-tech communication equipment and a bomb-proof floor. When the prez isn't in town, you can stay there. The suite is still available for election night at $2,500. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After he left the White House, Hoover moved into Suite 31A on the 31st floor of the Waldorf Towers. He died there Oct. 20, 1964. His Waldorf living room was re-created at his presidential library in Iowa. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  John F. Kennedy thought the Waldorf was stuffy. He preferred the more stylish Carlyle Hotel at Madison and 76th Street, and stayed there so often that it was dubbed the New York White House. Legend has it that there was a secret passage through which Marilyn Monroe could slip in and out undetected. After Kennedy was assassinated, Jackie Kennedy lived in a suite there for 10 months. Caroline and John Jr. played in the lobby on rainy days. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Columbia University is closely associated with two presidents: Dwight Eisenhower and Barack Obama. As president of Columbia from 1948 until 1953, Eisenhower lived in a mansion at 60 Morningside Drive. Old faculty members heard rumors that Mamie Eisenhower enjoyed martinis at 11 a.m. in her bedroom on the top floor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama's Columbia digs were more modest. As an undergrad in the early '80s, he lived in a third-floor walk-up at 142 W. 109th St. and, in his senior year, at 339 E. 94th St. A former roommate, Phil Boerner, recently recalled that they often ate breakfast at Tom's Restaurant on Broadway at 112th Street, which served as the gathering place for Jerry's gang on &quot;Seinfeld.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Big Apple co-op boards are notoriously tough, especially if you're a disgraced ex-president. Richard Nixon moved to the city after a few years in exile in San Clemente, Calif. In 1979, he put down a deposit on a penthouse at 19 E. 72nd St., but the board vetoed the sale. Nixon wound up buying a 19th century townhouse at 142 E. 65th St. Arthur Schlesinger, a Kennedy aide who lived nearby, quipped, &quot;There goes the neighborhood.&quot; But by all accounts, Nixon was friendly and approachable during daily walks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two presidents took the oath of office in the city: Washington, on the site where Federal Hall now stands, and Chester A. Arthur, in his townhouse at 123 Lexington Ave. Arthur was sworn in at 2:15 a.m. on Sept. 20, 1881, after President James Garfield was assassinated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When he left the White House, Arthur returned to 123 Lex and died there in 1886. Since 1944, the building has been home to Kalustyan's, an Indian spice and grocery store. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although many presidents lived in NYC, only one has his final resting place here. That would be the man who is buried in Grant's Tomb, at 122nd Street and Riverside Drive - Ulysses S. Grant, who is there with his wife, Julia. </SPAN></P>
