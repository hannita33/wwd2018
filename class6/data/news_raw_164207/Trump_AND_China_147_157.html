<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Issue: President Obama retaliating against Russia for its role in the DNC hacking scandal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2015, it was reported that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hacked the US Office of Personnel Management (&quot;The Bum's Russian,&quot; Dec. 30).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It hacked into the personal records of millions of government employees, yet President Obama brought no action against this very serious issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why now? Why this slap on the wrist against Russia? Could it be because Hillary Clinton shockingly lost an election that was a repudiation of his entire presidency? Al DiLascia </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Chicopee, Mass. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Let me get this straight: This country has a president who gives billions to a terror-sponsoring nation (Iran) and lets Syria kill thousands of innocent people but sanctions Russia for hacking Democrats' e-mails and exposing the truth? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Jan. 20 can't get here quick enough. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whenever Republicans do something stupid, Democrats have an amazing ability to prove they can be even dumber.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   With the Republicans electing a big man-baby as president, Obama will not be outdone and acts even more like a baby than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by expelling Russia's diplomats. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the Russians were truly hacking the election, Obama should have done something about it before Election Day, but he chose not to.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Gilroy, Calif. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama is such a strong and powerful leader, he finally sanctioned the Russians after years of hacking.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why now? Because Obama is out of office in three weeks and won't have to face any retaliation. What a coward.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Jericho </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With only a few weeks left to his presidency, Obama finally grew a pair and issued sanctions against Russia for meddling in the election.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was aware of the meddling for a while, but it took Hillary's loss to get the president to do something. It didn't matter if the hackers were stealing top secrets or military info. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Yonkers </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nothing better symbolizes the audacity of Obama, the Clintons and the Democratic Party than their willingness to incite a brand-new Cold War with Russia over Hillary's loss. </SPAN></P>
