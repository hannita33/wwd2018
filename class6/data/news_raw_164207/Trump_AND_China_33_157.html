<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wife, Melania, hit the campaign trail with him Monday on the eve of the Wisconsin primary, standing by her man as he weathers a series of storms over women's issues.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;No matter who you are, a man or a woman, he treats everyone equal,&quot; Melania told supporters in Milwaukee. &quot;He's a fighter. As you may know by now, when you attack him, he will punch back 10 times harder.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After her speech, the beaming GOP front-runner kissed her and gushed, &quot;So beautiful.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Melania's speech came at a critical time for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has taken heat for comments about abortion, Ted Cruz's wife, and a female reporter who was allegedly assaulted by his campaign manager. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Melania, a former model, also talked up her spouse on Fox News, saying he has a good heart, but she wishes he'd act more presidential. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He has, you know, great nights and he can be presidential,&quot; Melania said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;But sometimes he just, like, he cannot stand if somebody attacks . . . So I say stay away from retweets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;If he would only listen.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> closed to within 5 points of Ted Cruz in Wisconsin, a new poll showed Monday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Emerson College survey also showed Bernie Sanders with a 51 to 43 percent lead over Hillary Clinton - who abandoned campaigning in Wisconsin to make a stand in her home state of New York. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Emerson poll showed Cruz beating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 40 percent to 35 percent. While that would appear to be good news for the Texas senator, a Fox Business News poll on Thursday showed him ahead by 10 points, 42 to 32 percent.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Sanders' lead widened since a CBS poll on Sunday had him ahead 49 to 47 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, speaking earlier in La Crosse, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> denounced &quot;experts,&quot; saying they had made a mess of the world and suggested he might be better off without them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;You look at what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doing in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, and they say, 'Oh, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't have experts,' &quot; he said, while defending his own controversial positions on foreign policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;You know, I've always wanted to say this. I've never said this before with all the talking we all do. All of these experts, 'Oh, we need an expert.' The experts are terrible.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> guaranteed an upset victory in the Badger State. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton, meanwhile, touted her home region as a possible end point for the campaign during swings through Manhattan and Albany to meet with Democratic lawmakers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;She said if she wins big in New York [on April 19], it's over, &quot; said Assemblyman Jos&eacute; Rivera (D-Bronx).  </SPAN></P>
