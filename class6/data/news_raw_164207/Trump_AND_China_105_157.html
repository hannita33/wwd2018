<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Once again, medieval savages have brought terror upon innocent men, women and children (&quot;Again,&quot; July 15).  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We can now expect a few candlelight vigils and a speech by President Obama politicizing the matter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Shame on all of us for allowing ISIS to draw breath on this planet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Robert Mangi </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Westbury </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These so-called lone-wolf attacks are so numerous that the use of the word &quot;lone&quot; is a misnomer. When will President Obama finally declare we're at war? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From Okinawa to the death march in Burma, President Franklin Roosevelt didn't just condemn every tragedy, he kept up the war effort. Were the acts against defenseless citizens in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> committed by lone wolves? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The time has come to realize these attacks have been occurring on a nearly daily basis in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia as well as the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Not to admit we're at war is dangerous.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Uri Burstein </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Flushing </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Regardless of your social hot-button interest, the No. 1 issue facing America (and the rest of the world) is the accelerated spread of Islamic terrorism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yes, President George W. Bush and the Republicans lit the fuse by invading Iraq. But over the last eight years, President Obama has apologized for that mistake by pulling out and destabilizing the Middle East more than ever. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a bombastic, egomaniacal bully who gets things done. I don't want to have dinner with him, but I want him to solve the No. 1 problem facing our country.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the right choice to slow and, hopefully, reverse the damage caused by Obama and Hillary Clinton over the past eight years. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Laguna Beach, Calif. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How could that &shy;18-wheeler get past the security barriers and drive right into the Bastille Day celebration without any police action being taken?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If a truck came past security barriers in Times Square on New Year's Day or near the East River on July 4, police would have tried to kill the driver and disable the truck immediately.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was a sizable military presence at the location for the event, which makes the failure to stop the killer more quickly so surprising.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Michael Gorman </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Whitestone </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Let's not be as stupid as the Europeans, who have allowed millions of refugees into their continent.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Allowing these refugees in increases the possibility that radical jihadists will enter the country and unleash their wrath. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These radical extremists are sick people and delight in killing. They must be kept out of the United States. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Heber City, Utah </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm sure that after the terrorist act in Nice, the Democrats will demand that we ban &quot;assault trucks.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I wonder if Hillary will attack the Teamsters union as she does the National Rifle Association. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Michael Pacer </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Paso Robles, Calif. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now we wait for our politicians to complete their speeches and hand-wringing and for experts and pundits to pound their fists and pontificate on the proper course of action. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In other words, now we wait while our leaders do nothing and let innocent blood continue to flow. </SPAN></P>
