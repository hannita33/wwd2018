<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the right: Dems' John Lewis Dilemma </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's no surprise Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pushback against Rep. John Lewis' charge that he's an &quot;illegitimate president&quot; has caused a furor. But, asks Byron York in the Washington Examiner, how many Democrats agree with Lewis? So far, the response has been mixed: &quot;Some openly disagree with Lewis. Others disagree but don't want to say so explicitly. Still others agree but don't want to say so explicitly. And some wholeheartedly support Lewis.&quot; Even Bernie Sanders refused to sign on to the &quot;illegitimate&quot; claim. Because for some Democrats, it &quot;would move them a bit too close to a kind of birtherism that they spent years denouncing.&quot; Indeed, &quot;if anyone other than John Lewis were leading the legitimacy fight, even more Democrats might distance themselves from it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Conservative take: Human Rights Watch's Humiliation </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first step toward correcting a problem &quot;is admitting you have one,&quot; says Noah Rothman at Commentary, adding: &quot;The left isn't there yet.&quot; Case in point: Human Rights Watch, which has just declared Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a threat to global human rights. Of course, this is all speculative, since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;hasn't taken office yet,&quot; so &quot;nothing has happened.&quot; And a close look shows these complaints to be &quot;hollow partisanship,&quot; since the &quot;threats&quot; include appointing pro-life judges and repealing ObamaCare. Which means &quot;it isn't </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who represents a threat to human rights in HRW's estimation but conservatism.&quot; So, like that Harvard study &quot;which laughably determined that North Carolina is today less free and democratic than North Korea, Human Rights Watch has given its critics ample justification to ignore its findings.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Schools watch: Which Cory Booker Will Stand Up? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The confirmation process of Education Secretary-designate Betsy DeVos, according to the National Review's John Fund, will &quot;test the reform bona fides of New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker, a school-choice supporter who has served with DeVos on the board of a school-choice group.&quot; In his two terms as mayor of Newark, he &quot;expanded charter schools.&quot; But now that he's eyeing a run for president, Booker &quot;suddenly has 'serious concerns' about DeVos, despite having worked closely with her in the past,&quot; for fear of &quot;withering fire from the powerful teachers' unions.&quot; If Booker rejects DeVos, &quot;he will not only have given the school-choice movement he has championed a slap in the face, he will also have called into question the reputation he had of being a liberal problem-solver.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Centrist: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Can Transform US-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relations </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Washington Post Editorial-Page Editor Fred Hiatt says Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;is not all wrong about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; - which gives him &quot;an opportunity to reshape what, if not handled carefully, could become the world's most dangerous bilateral relationship.&quot; Though wrong on some specifics, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;underlying message of basic unfairness was right. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not operating by the same rules as everyone else.&quot; Yet &quot;initiating a trade war, by slapping tariffs on Chinese products, would likely harm Chinese and Americans alike without accomplishing much.&quot; So </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;should insist on more reciprocity in economic relations, but consistent with fairness and principles of economic freedom, not simply to gain an upper hand.&quot; That would benefit &quot;American workers and firms,&quot; but mostly &quot;the Chinese people.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Political expert: Don't Kid Yourself - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is Winning </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It'd be easy to call Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition &quot;a mess for the president-elect,&quot; says Matthew Cooper at Newsweek, but for one thing: &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is getting what he wants.&quot; He notes, &quot;it's unlikely any of his cabinet nominees will be rejected by the Senate.&quot; Yes, several &quot;nominees took issue with some of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> enunciated positions.&quot; But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has backed off some of his more controversial stances, so &quot;the differences between what his nominees stated and what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has stated isn't as great as had been implied.&quot; Moreover, &quot;on any number of other issues, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is likely to get enough of what he wants to claim victory.&quot; So &quot;he looks poised for a lot of victories, despite critics underestimating him, which, come to think of it, sounds pretty familiar.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
