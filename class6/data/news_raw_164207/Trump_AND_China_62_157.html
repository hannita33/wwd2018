<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Former Wall Street Journal scribe Asra Nomani is a woman, immigrant and Muslim, and she agrees with the Democratic Party's positions on social issues and global warming. But she voted for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. As she writes in The Washington Post, &quot;I am a single mother who can't afford health insurance under Obamacare. The president's mortgage-loan modification program, 'HOPE NOW,' didn't help me . . . I see rural America and ordinary Americans, like me, still struggling to make ends meet, after eight years of the Obama administration.&quot; And there's another reason: As a Muslim reformer, &quot;What worried me the most were my concerns about the influence of theocratic Muslim dictatorships, including Qatar and Saudi Arabia, in a Hillary Clinton America . . . We have to stand up with moral courage against not just hate against Muslims, but hate by Muslims.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Libertarian: The Fake Hate-Crime Epidemic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The narrative emerging of a rash of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-inspired hate crimes is populated by hoaxes, as Elizabeth Nolan Brown points out at Reason. A Muslim female student in Louisiana had her claim of being assaulted by racists in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hats went viral - until she admitted she made it up. A young San Diego Muslim woman's tale of being targeted for theft by Trumpers didn't quite hold up. A supposed gay bashing by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fans in Santa Monica is falling apart. Same goes for a supposed racist attack in Delaware and an anti-Asian incident in Minnesota. &quot;Less dramatic acts of racism . . . do seem to be bubbling up more frequently this week,&quot; she writes. But that's &quot;a world apart from the wave of 'hate crimes' and violent attacks that many are conjuring up right now.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dem runner-up: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Win No Shock </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and self-described socialist whom Hillary Clinton beat for the Democratic nomination this year, isn't surprised </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won. Writing in The New York Times, he says </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tapped into the fact that Americans &quot;work longer hours for lower wages as they see decent paying jobs go to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mexico or some other low-wage country . . . Many of their once beautiful rural towns have depopulated, their downtown stores are shuttered, and their kids are leaving home because there are no jobs.&quot; Sanders says he hopes Democrats realize all that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> got right - because it's what they once claimed to stand for: &quot;I believe strongly that the party must break loose from its corporate establishment ties and, once again, become a grass-roots party of working people, the elderly and the poor.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the right: Fracking's Vindication </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Environmental Protection Agency drilled test wells in Wyoming supposedly to ensure nearby fracking wouldn't contaminate the groundwater. Complains of &quot;foul-smelling water&quot; soon followed. So the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality investigated, and has now determined that - surprise! - the contamination was caused by the EPA. Jazz Shaw at Hot Air writes: &quot;The EPA well was drilled in a defective fashion. The artificial materials in the well almost certainly came from the drilling process when the EPA dug the wells.&quot; Plus, &quot;the junk they allowed in there clogged the screens down at the base of the well. This allowed stagnant, standing water to build up at the bottom and it became infested with bacteria and biological agents.&quot; The claim that fracking contaminates groundwater is the myth that won't die, he says. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Silicon Valley engineer: Cali's Dumb Secession Threat </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some tech bigshots, writes Elaine Ou at Bloomberg, are suggesting California secede. Ou says it would go as well as the South's secession over slavery. The state needs America: &quot;The Bay Area tech industry received much of its early funding from the US Navy for things like radios and aeronautics research, which created demand for vacuum tubes and San Jose's mercury mines. The biggest buyers of early silicon circuits were the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.&quot; And that's not all: &quot;Southern California gets most of its water from the Colorado River in Arizona, and the entire state's natural gas and oil supply arrives through pipelines coming from Texas. Many California-based companies are incorporated in Delaware, for the lower tax rates.&quot; </SPAN></P>
