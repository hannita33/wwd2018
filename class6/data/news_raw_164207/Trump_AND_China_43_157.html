</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's all folks! I'm out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Embracing the presidential aspirations of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was, from the start, an exercise in magical thinking. In my heart, I wanted the smack-talking, hair-challenged, self-absorbed New York City billionaire Republican to nail down this baby. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in my head? Not so much. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I've hung out with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 70, many times over the years, professionally, socially and in wacky combinations of the two. I interviewed him inside a stretch limo in New Hampshire in 2011 about his White House ambitions. But the chat devolved into a madcap dash through Podunk streets too small for his ride - or his ego. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> soon got palpably bored with the Granite State and the presidency, and started motor-mouthing about &quot;Celebrity Apprentice'' and his suspicion, which was proven wrong, that President Obama was born in Kenya. He asked the driver to drop him off at his private chopper emblazoned with the name &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">TRUMP'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' for the trip home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Want a ride in my helicopter?'' he asked me. Not wanting to find myself airborne over the Throgs Neck Bridge with no exit strategy, I begged off. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here is a guy with the common touch, but the attention span of a flea. He's someone voters would enjoy having a beer with, even though he doesn't drink alcohol. Can you imagine the torture of sharing a Bud Light with Democrat Hillary Clinton? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But some of us smitten with his shoot-from-the-lip style have reached our limits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I think </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> secretly doesn't want the prize. Why would he crave spending endless hours in policy meetings, cavorting with miserable domestic and world leaders and abandoning his collection of obscenely opulent abodes to live in public housing at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. in Washington, DC? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His penthouse, which sprawls over the 66th, 67th and 68th floors of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower, looks like the palace of Louis XIV - if the French king mated with Liberace, with 24-karat-gold accents adorning everything from the lamps to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">china,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> marble bathtubs and a vaulted living-room ceiling painted with a fresco of scantily clad babes.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When I visited about two months after his lovely wife, Melania, now 46, gave birth to the couple's son, Barron, now 10, the infamous germophobe boasted that after fathering five children, he'd never changed a diaper. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I enthused that Melania, who stood quietly nearby aboard 5-inch stilettos, had lost all her baby weight. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> corrected me: &quot;She's almost lost all the baby weight.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   I was embarrassed for the mother of his youngest kid, who ignored the dig. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> staffers asked a photographer and me to put sterile cotton booties over our shoes so as not to sully the carpet. It was time to get the hell out of the loony bin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  My all-time favorite Hollywood GOP curmudgeon, Clint Eastwood, 86, told Esquire magazine in the September issue that we're living in a &quot;pussy generation'' beholden to political correctness. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he said, is &quot;onto something.'' But he stopped short of endorsing him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> picked a stupid fight with the Muslim Gold Star parents of 27-year-old Army Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq in 2004. Sure, dad Khizr Khan put the candidate on the spot while at the Democratic National Convention. Holding up a copy of the US Constitution, he needled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - &quot;Have you even read the Constitution?'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could have said he's sorry for the Khans' loss, and left it at that. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, he said the dad had &quot;no right'' to &quot;viciously'' criticize him, and accused the slain soldier's mom, Ghazala Khan, of standing by silently as her husband spoke because she is Muslim. (She later said she was too distraught to speak.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won't back down from his lunacy and bigotry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I can no longer justify calling myself a Trumpkin. I'm done with The Donald. Let's grab a beer - or I will - and call it quits. </SPAN></P>
