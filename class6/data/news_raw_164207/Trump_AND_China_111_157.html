<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  LAS VEGAS - There are few places where Will Smith, Caitlyn Jenner, John Boehner, and Kobe Bryant are the sideshow - but that was exactly the scene on Thursday as the hedge fund industry gathered here for its annual powwow. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With the average fund facing a third straight year of losses - and many investors pulling their cash - the powerful investors were in no mood to party or to mingle much with the celebrity set. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sure there were panel discussions on various investment choices and plenty of talk about politics - Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> national finance chairman Steve Mnuchin was making the rounds - but most of the action took place in a mammoth back conference room. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the conference room, fund managers sat at communal tables or on the patio dissecting pitch books, pushing investment ideas, all in the hopes of taking in potentially billions of dollars.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  David Dunn, the president of Kingsbridge Wealth Management, with $150 million of assets under management, told The Post that he was pitched by 57 funds last year. He invested in four.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This year, he might invest in just one or two, he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's harder to find a &quot;better trade&quot; in a crowded field of managers, Dunn said. &quot;Smaller niche strategies are where the real return is.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There's more urgency to raise capital this year because, as one manager put it, &quot;you don't want to be the fund that lost money.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There's an underlying fear in the hedge fund world that the spigot of money is about to get shut off.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the past year, giant pensions in California and New York have pulled billions of dollars in investments. This year, so, too, have insurance giants AIG and MetLife.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Over the last couple of years, I'm kind of disappointed with the performance,&quot; Roslyn Zhang, a managing director at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investment Corp., told attendees at one session. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With hedge fund performance down, it is getting harder to raise money. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hedge funds raised $4 billion in February - down from $23 billion the year before, Ilana Weinstein of the IDW group said at Milken private equity conference in LA earlier this month.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  n  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Top fundraisers for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made pitches to hedge fund investors to line up behind the presumptive Republican presidential nominee as he seeks to raise $1 billion for the general election campaign, Reuters reports. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mnuchin met with some of the attending hedge fund managers seeking to raise money for his new boss. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also speaking at the event was former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who in an onstage interview, declined to endorse any candidate. Earlier this year, Bloomberg flirted with an independent candidacy, but decided against it for fear it would help </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chances of getting elected. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some investors told Reuters they were disappointed Bloomberg did not run. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Best-selling author Michael Lewis, who has written extensively on Wall Street, pushed back at comments made by Citadel's Ken Griffin, who said during a panel discussion that the IEX exchange posted stale numbers. </SPAN></P>
