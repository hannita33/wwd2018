<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Democrats' obsession with the idea that racism was the main reason Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won isn't backed by the data. &quot;This stereotyping of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> voters is not only illiberal, it falsely presumes Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won because of his worst comments about women and minorities rather than despite them,&quot; writes David Paul Kuhn in The New York Times. It's true that a pre-election poll found a majority of white working-class voters thought </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lacked a sense of decency. &quot;But they were not voting on decency,&quot; Kuhn points out. A post-election study found </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> improved over George W. Bush's winning coalition in 2000 &quot;in areas hurt most by competition from Chinese imports . . . The study concluded that, had the import competition from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> been half as large, Mrs. Clinton would have won key swing states and the presidency with them.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pop-culture file: Princess Leia's Smashed Glass Ceiling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There were princesses in movies before Carrie Fisher played Princess Leia, but none quite like her, writes Eliana Dockterman in Time. &quot;Leia Organa was the first pop-culture princess to take matters into her own hands, to boss up, to tell the male heroes what to do, and, literally, to save the galaxy,&quot; Dockterman says. &quot;For that, she became instantly iconic.&quot; She fired a weapon as well as the boys, led troops &quot;like Washington over the Delaware&quot; and generally dressed like an action hero, not a princess. And even the big exception - her famous gold bikini as Jabba the Hut's chained hostage - ended when Leia &quot;murders Jabba by choking him with the very chains that were supposed to keep her submissive. The glee shows on Fisher's face.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the right: Socialism Is Killing Venezuela </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the fall of the Soviet Union, writes The Boston Globe's Jeff Jacoby, socialism's useful idiots in the West looked for a new champion. And they found one in Hugo Chavez, &quot;the anti-Yanqui rabble-rouser who was elected president of Venezuela in 1998 and in short order had transformed the country from a successful social democracy into a grim and corrupt autocracy.&quot; High oil prices hid the devastation awaiting what was once Latin America's most prosperous nation under Chavez's stifling socialism. Venezuelans now &quot;face crippling shortages of everything from food and medicine to toilet paper and electricity. Violent crime is out of control.&quot; Despite the comforting myths of its Western cheerleaders, Jacoby says, &quot;Socialism invariably kills and impoverishes.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Conservative take: Keep the House Cameras On </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  House Republicans are proposing new rules for their chamber that would fine members for two kinds of disruptive behavior. Except one of them isn't really disruptive, explains Jazz Shaw at Hot Air. The new rules would fine members for blocking the well of the House - as Democrats did with their gun-control sit-in this past summer. That, Shaw says, is OK. But fining them for taking video and pictures on the floor and putting them out on the Web is silly. &quot;The taxpayers fund the existence of the building and the salaries of everyone doing business there,&quot; Shaw writes. &quot;Anything that happens inside that chamber (unless it's a discussion of sensitive, national security information) is our business.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Foreign-policy scribe: Punishing the United Nations </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In response to the UN Security Council vote against Israel last Friday, three GOP senators - Lindsey Graham (SC), Ted Cruz (Texas) and Tom Cotton (Ark.) - are working on plans to knock the United Nations, reports Josh Rogin in The Washington Post. &quot;Some are considered 'micro' options, such as passing a resolution that would bar any funding that might go to implementing the anti-settlement resolution,&quot; Rogin writes. Others include &quot;withdrawing the United States from UN organizations such as UNESCO or passing legislation to protect settlers who are American citizens and might be vulnerable to consequences of the resolution.&quot; &quot;The Security Council's anti-settlement resolution has opened up a Pandora's box in Washington, allowing anyone with a grievance against the world body to have their day in the sun.&quot; -Compiled by Seth Mandel </SPAN></P>
