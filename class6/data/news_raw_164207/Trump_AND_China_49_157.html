<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  WASHINGTON - Ted Cruz's Indiana strategy is hardly looking like a rousing &quot;Hoosiers&quot; story, with polls on Sunday showing a slam-dunk for Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the state's Tuesday primary. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The billionaire is enjoying his biggest lead yet in the Hoosier State, with support from 49 percent of likely Republican primary voters compared with Cruz's 34 percent and John Kasich's 13 percent, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll found. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said a victory in Tuesday's primary would essentially clinch the nomination for him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It's over,&quot; he told &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot; &quot;I think it's over now. But it's over. Cruz cannot win . . . He's got no highway.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz and Kasich had teamed up to stop </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with the Texas senator campaigning alone in Indiana, while leaving New Mexico and Oregon to the Ohio governor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the deal appeared to have backfired among Indiana voters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sunday's poll showed 58 percent of likely GOP voters in the state disagreed with the deal, while only 34 percent approved.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz has framed Indiana as an &quot;absolutely pivotal&quot; last stand. Last week, he named former rival Carly Fiorina as his running mate to boltser his campaign.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There are 57 delegates up for grabs in winner-take-most Indiana, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the only remaining GOP candidate who can reach the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination before the party's convention in July.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Cruz vowed to stick around after Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I agree that Indiana is incredibly important,&quot; he told &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot; &quot;Regardless of what happens in Indiana, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not getting to 1,237. No one's getting to 1,237. We are heading to a contested convention.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of the last seven polls in Indiana, only an Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne survey had Cruz ahead, with a 16-point lead. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In more good news for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Indiana voters picked him over Hillary Clinton, 48 to 41 percent, in a hypothetical matchup.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz, however, also had a 7-point advantage over Clinton. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, meanwhile, attacked the US trade deficit with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sunday - by comparing it to rape. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We can't continue to allow </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to rape our country, and that's what they are doing,&quot; he said at a rally in Fort Wayne, Ind. &quot;It's the greatest theft in the history of the world.&quot; </SPAN></P>
