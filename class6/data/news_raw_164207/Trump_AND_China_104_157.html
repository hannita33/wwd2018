<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Amazon boss Jeff Bezos' acquisition of the Washington Post was made on a handshake.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a wide-ranging interview at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit here, Bezos acknowledged he agreed to pay $250 million to buy the Washington Post from the Graham family in 2013 without looking at the books. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I did zero due diligence,&quot; he told the Aspen Institute's Walter Isaacson during the interview. Bezos was tapped as the No. 1 mogul at this year's event.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I did not negotiate. I accepted the asking price. [Then-Washington Post CEO] Donald Graham was the most honorable person in the world. He laid out every single [detail] worth knowing that was bad and everything that was great about the paper.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;No amount of due diligence would have uncovered the things he told me,&quot; Bezos asserted.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The billionaire said he is changing the business model and the culture at the paper from one where a small number of people pay a high price to one where a wide number of people pay a low price.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, he remains skeptical that consumers are ready to make micro-payments for articles.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite his business input, Bezos said he rarely ventures into the newsroom. &quot;I call it the other Washington,&quot; the Seattle resident said of DC.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the Bezos talk focused on Amazon's expansion and &quot;the need to be nimble and robust and able to take a punch,&quot; it was politics that garnered the most attention in the 40-minute interview.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One questioner asked him what he thought of the disclosure this week that eBay co-founder Peter Thiel donated more than $1 million to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Peter Thiel is a contrarian,&quot; said Bezos. &quot;You have to remember that contrarians are usually wrong.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the rare occasions they are right, he conceded, they usually &quot;win big.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thiel was an early backer of Facebook and still sits on its board. Bezos said that, while he might disapprove of the donation, he would not force such a person off a board of directors.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It's way too divisive to say, 'If you have this opinion, you can't sit on my board.' That makes no sense.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Trav's tail </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Uber founder Travis Kalanick's decision this summer to sell the company's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unit to a local rival may come back to bite him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-sharing company that bought Uber </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, has plans to go global, which could put it on a collision course with Kalanick's sector-leading company.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;One thing I can share with you - we're definitely going global,&quot; Didi Chuxing President Jean Liu told attendees Thursday at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit here.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Just 24 hours earlier, Kalanick told the same gathering he was &quot;happy&quot; with the way he exited an expensive </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foray - with a 20 percent stake in the combined company plus a board seat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kalanick, whose company is active in more than 70 countries and 400 cities, admitted he has not been to any Didi board meetings since the August deal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Liu, whose company has 14 million drivers across </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and provides more than 10 million rides a day, did say that it's possible that the global push could involve local partnerships.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We're a big sponsor and a big believer in local players. If there are not existing local players, we'll go there by ourselves,&quot; she said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked pointedly by Bloomberg's Emily Chang if that meant she was going to be competing with Uber, she said only, &quot;We will definitely play a global game.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Didi counts some big investments aside from Uber.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Apple owns a minority stake after investing $1 billion earlier this year, and e-commerce giant Alibaba inadvertently became a partner, too, when it backed a separate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-based ride-sharing company that was bought out by Didi.  </SPAN></P>
