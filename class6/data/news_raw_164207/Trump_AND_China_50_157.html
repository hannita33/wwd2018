<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We're not being reimbursed for the kind of tremendous service that we're performing by protecting various countries,&quot; the Republican front-runner was quoted as saying. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he would boycott oil from Saudi Arabia and other allies &shy;unless they provide troops or funds to fight ISIS. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;If Saudi Arabia was without the cloak of American protection . . . I don't think it would be around,&quot; he told The New York Times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is open to removing US forces from Japan and South Korea if they did not take on the cost of housing and feeding troops on American bases there, the report said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He argued that it is getting expensive to keep &quot;defending the world.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We defend everybody. When in doubt, come to the United States. We'll defend you. In some cases free of charge,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pushed back against suggestions his foreign policy was &quot;isolationist.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I am 'America First,' &quot; he said. &quot;I like the expression.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He vowed to renegotiate the Iran deal to extend restrictions on the country's ability to build nuclear weapons while also allowing Iran to buy planes and other goods made in the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;We gave them $150 billion, and they can't spend it in our country,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The United States, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> view, has lost power economically and militarily for decades. He cited the Teddy Roosevelt era as the period when America's might peaked. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We have been disrespected, mocked and ripped off for many, many years by people that were smarter, shrewder, tougher,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vowed to restore the country's role as a global superpower. He suggested the United States has acted like a &quot;big bully&quot; and was &quot;not smartly led.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A cornerstone of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doctrine is his &quot;unpredictability&quot; in dealing with foreign leaders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I wouldn't want them to know what my real thinking is,&quot; he said. &quot;I would use trade, absolutely, as a bargaining chip.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He defended US surveillance of allies like Israel and Germany, saying, &quot;They're spying against us.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he would allow Japan and South Korea to develop their own nuclear programs instead of depending on America for protection from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and North Korea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He wouldn't rule out using nuclear weapons against an adversary, saying he would use nukes as an &quot;absolute last step.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> held out hope he could facilitate the greatest deal of them all - lasting peace in Israel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I would have a better chance than anybody of making a deal,&quot; he said.  </SPAN></P>
