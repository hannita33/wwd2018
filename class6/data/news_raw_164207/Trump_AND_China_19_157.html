<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alibaba just published eye-popping results for its annual Singles Day sales bash - but it wasn't enough to offset the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> factor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-based e-commerce giant said it raked in nearly $17.8 billion during the splashy, 24-hour sales event Friday - a figure that easily dwarfs, for example, last year's tally of $3 billion in online sales across the US on Cyber Monday. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Alibaba's stock dipped 1.4 percent on Friday, to $92.99, capping a three-day selloff that left the shares 7 percent lower. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The worry is that President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will follow through on his protectionist rhetoric against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, potentially crippling the Middle Kingdom's fast-growing, but fragile consumer economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;America and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cannot ignore each other,&quot; Joe Tsai, Alibaba's executive vice chairman, said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;If the two countries don't work together, everybody else in the world will suffer,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to Tsai's tone of desperation, a few insiders saw other potential signs for worry for Alibaba as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> organized his transition team from his aerie in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The shopping shindig orchestrated by Alibaba's billionaire founder, Jack Ma - called Singles Day because it is held on Nov. 11, or 11/11 - was live-streamed Friday from a 60,000-seat stadium in Shenzhen and headlined by A-list stars like Scarlett Johansson, Kobe Bryant and David Beckham. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The originally scheduled headliner was pop star Katy Perry, who backed out at the last minute citing a family emergency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;She could not make it out due to a family matter,&quot; Alibaba spokesman Bob Christie told The Post. &quot;That's all we know.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That wasn't enough to quash speculation that Perry - a vocal Hillary Clinton supporter who tweeted, &quot;WE WILL NEVER BE SILENCED&quot; after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory - was removed from the Singles Day lineup by Alibaba because of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-related concerns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;You could imagine that, under the circumstances, Katy Perry might be seen as whipping up the crowd with the wrong kind of message,&quot; one investor speculated. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokeswoman for Perry didn't respond to requests for comment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's not just </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-related worries that have ldogged Alibaba lately .  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Singles Day sales topped $1 billion during the first five minutes alone, kicking off sprees that easily surpassed last year's one-day total of $14.3 billion, according to the Chinese tech titan.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, those numbers are measured in what Alibaba calls &quot;gross merchandise volume,&quot; or GMV - a term that has become fodder for short sellers who question whether it isn't larded with significant amounts of fake and canceled sales. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As reported by The Post, an investigation of Alibaba's accounting by the Securities and Exchange Commission, disclosed by the company in May, is being assisted by at least one whistleblower. </SPAN></P>
