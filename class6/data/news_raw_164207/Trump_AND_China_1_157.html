<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> issued a formal diplomatic protest Saturday after Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took a call from the president of Taiwan, but congressional Republicans and diplomatic hard-liners applauded the Friday phone chat as a clear sign there's a new sheriff in town. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Plaudits to president-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for his historic phone call to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen,&quot; tweeted Rep. Pete King (R-LI). &quot;Strong message to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. New day in Asia.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz chimed in, &quot;I would much rather have Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> talking to President Tsai than to Cuba's Raul Castro or Iran's Hasan Rouhani. This is an improvement.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Former UN Ambassador John Bolton - in the running to become </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> secretary of state and someone who was present in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower on Friday - pooh-poohed critics' worries the call could undo decades of delicate diplomacy and lead to conflict between the superpowers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The president of the United States should talk to whomever he wants if he thinks it's in the interest of the United States, and nobody in Beijing gets to dictate who we talk to,&quot; he told Fox News on Saturday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bolton has pushed for closer relations with Taiwan and a tougher American stance against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aggressive territorial claims in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pointed out that the United States has continued its trade and defense relationships with Taiwan regardless of its official diplomatic status. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Interesting how the US sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wrote on Twitter. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tony Nash, of the data-analysis firm Complete Intelligence, thinks the call is a sign of things to come.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He tweeted: &quot;The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taiwan call put </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on defense after it's played offense w weaker neighbors for years. US policy in Asia will not be status quo.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Daniel Blumenthal of the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank, believes the phone call will not have much of an &shy;effect on relations between the two superpowers.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot; 'Experts' saying </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will go ballistic actually have no understanding of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' he tweeted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was no immediate public reaction from mainland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, Xi Jinping. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The White House, which was unaware of the phone call ahead of time, said that it changed nothing about the nation's &quot;longstanding policy&quot; on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Taiwan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The call broke nearly 40 years of strictly observed protocol. It was the first direct communication between a Taiwanese and US leader or leader-in-waiting since 1979, when President Jimmy Carter withdrew diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in favor of a US relationship with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sees the island nation as a breakaway province and considers its democratically elected government illegitimate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Saturday that it had lodged &quot;stern representations&quot; with the &quot;relevant US side&quot; - without saying whether that meant the US State Department or the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10-minute talk with President Tsai, aides said, the two leaders &quot;noted the close economic, political and security ties . . . between Taiwan and the United States&quot; and congratulated one another on their recent &shy;victories. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tsai, Taiwan's first female president, was elected in January as a pro-independence candidate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said on Twitter Friday that Tsai had initiated the call: &quot;The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency.&quot; But aides to both leaders said the conversation was prearranged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Of course both sides agreed ahead of time before making contact,&quot; said a spokesman for Tsai, who was even photographed while speaking to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi initially made light of the incident despite his government's later formal objections, dismissing it as &quot;a little trick&quot; on &shy;Taiwan's part.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;This is just the Taiwan side engaging in a petty action and cannot change the 'One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> structure already formed by the international community,&quot; Wang said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Social-media-fueled rumors that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had used the Taiwan call to promote his business interests there were flatly denied by his representatives Saturday, according to The Wall Street Journal.
