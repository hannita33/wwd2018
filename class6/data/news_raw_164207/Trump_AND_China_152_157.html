<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Spring arrives in a week, bringing daffodils, hay fever and an urge to clean the house - not to mention the snowstorm that late March usually sneaks in. Read on for the best in vernal equalizers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Woman's Day touts &quot;clever uses for baby powder&quot; - probably not the best idea considering Johnson &amp; Johnson has to pay $72 million for an ovarian cancer death linked to talcum powder. The magazine, apparently unfazed by this development, suggests using it between the bed sheets to absorb moisture and for silencing creaky floor boards. Just don't shake it on your body   The April issue of this Hearst magazine is an unremarkable mix of organizing tips, household budgeting, minimizing pet fur, etc. Stuff we've read a million times. The spring-theme fashion section was surprisingly modern and fresh. The rest is forgettable. Spring forward. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New editor Elizabeth Graves is starting to put her own imprint on Martha Stewart Living, the domestic diva's namesake magazine, now under the Meredith umbrella. Under Eric Pike, who exited the top of the masthead last year, the title had become a little too high concept, even for city slickers who love home arts and crafts. Graves is getting back to basics. There's a feature on tidying up the pantry, recipes for brisket and pound cake and new uses for yogurt. For collectors, the mag suggests a nice display of vintage dustpans and brushes. Trust Martha to turn trash pans into a lusted-after object with an artful photograph on the inside back page. The mag's still glamorous founder never fails to raise a giggle with some advice on how to get her hair-do. That's coupled, of course, with some shots of her modeling years. Martha, as always, is the &quot;mane&quot; event. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Family Circle delivers a meat-and-potatoes issue, offering little of the aspirational ideas we crave from a magazine. But it knows its readers, who will lap up home tips from HGTV's Chip and Joanna Gaines and a profile of Hallmark Channel regular Lori Loughlin. As its name suggests, the long-running magazine is focused on family issues, such as a twin coping with her brother's autism and a tennis-crazed family. The spring-theme reading is limited to a giant product spread on the 50 best cleaning products, a neutral fashion palette and, of course, Easter egg decorating. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When we think of spring, the fireplace doesn't immediately jump to mind. Regardless, Good Housekeeping offers ways to spring-ify the hearth: Start with some plants and some art. Elsewhere, the mag offers up no less than seven pages of bunny and egg-motif decorating ideas . We'd rather indulge in egg coloring than try out the 25 spring-cleaning hacks (or tips as they used to be called). Iron the carpet is one such nugget - we kid you not. There's plenty to read in the issue, ranging from the couple that took up goat farming to teen suicide prevention, but we take serious issue with the mag's suggestion that getting through a sink full of dishes can boost happiness and reduce stress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Aside from its story on El Chapo, in which Mexican actress Kate del Castillo accuses Sean Penn of hiding his journalistic intentions as they were planning their visit to the drug lord (Penn's assertions to the contrary are &quot;total and complete bulls--t,&quot; she says), the New Yorker finally does a piece about &quot;deep tensions&quot; inside the Democratic Party. Ryan Lizza, who has written something like half a dozen stories on such tensions in the GOP, gets Bernie Sanders on the record while Hillary Clinton abstains. &quot;It doesn't matter what her policies are,&quot; says Sanders, who doubts whether Clinton will &quot;stand up and fight&quot; for the jobless given her warm ties with Goldman Sachs. Elsewhere, check out Amy Davidson's piece on the 1924 Democratic National Convention, in which the party narrowly escaped giving an institutional seat to the Ku Klux Klan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Time's gauzy goodbye to Nancy Reagan hit the stands right before last Friday's dust-up over her AIDS legacy, courtesy of Hillary Clinton. Indeed, through the lens of the Clinton years, it's almost surreal to recall what a pair of billing-and-cooing lovebirds Ronnie and Nancy were. That's despite Nancy's &quot;dragon lady&quot; persona pushed by the press, from the $200,000 she spent on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">china</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> upon her White House arrival, to her supposed pivotal role in ending the Cold War as she left. Patti Davis reveals her mother constantly blasted the TV as a widow to cope with loneliness. &quot;I had to practically yell to be heard,&quot; Davis writes. Back in the present, Joe Klein says the media has realized &quot;too late&quot; that John Kasich was worth more of its attention than Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What a fresh voice we have squandered.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
