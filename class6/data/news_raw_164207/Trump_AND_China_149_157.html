<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  FORGET &quot;wherefore art thou Romeo?&quot; Here's where Len Cariou is. At off-B'way's Lion Theatre, premiering &quot;Broadway and the Bard: An Evening of Shakespeare &amp; Song.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tony winner. Done musicals like &quot;Sweeney Todd,&quot; &quot;A Little Night Music,&quot; &quot;Applause.&quot; What's he know from &quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thou?&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Please,&quot; he said, aggrieved. &quot;In '59, I did 'Henry V.' In my native Canada's Stratford Theatre, in my 20s, I did Shakespearean roles. 'King Lear' I played twice when I was 35. You learn so much. From the gravitas, the language, you acquire a presence. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Afterward, a regular play, the antithesis, seems so easy that it's like falling off a log.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What if you stumble, or blow a Shakespearean speech? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Tough to ad-lib. You can't make up Shakespeare. The rhythm's 10 beats to a line. You just mumble something and get to your next words. It's scary. Especially when you listen to guys doing it a long time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;You can't get a cough or cold. And there's no understudy. Just me onstage. You must protect yourself. Rest. Watch yourself carefully. Dress warmly.&quot; Drink? &quot;Of course. Don't be silly.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  About cellphone annoyances: &quot;I've stepped out of character and said, 'Will wouldn't appreciate that.' A high school came to one performance, which became ridiculous. At the footlights I said, 'Shut up, or I'll have the police clear the building.' Act 2, the offender was gone, and so was the entire balcony.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Will and Len open the 28th and run through March 6. &quot;That's the only time the theater was available, so six months ago I said, 'OK, let's do it.' &quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'Sunday' news </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A WORD for Charles Osgood, whom CBS-TV's bouncing and who told me: &quot;My wife, five kids and I spend 10 weeks a year in our St-Tropez house. Otherwise, I'm up 3:30 a.m. Sundays.&quot; Osgood's reported news since Lincoln's bar mitzvah. I know time marches on, but so should his Peabody- and Emmy-winning &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Retail woes </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SEVENTH Avenue mumbles. Nobody's dressing. It's sweaters and pants. Nobody's buying. It's Internet and online. With fashion gone the way of the bra, stores no longer keep merchandise. Good stuff's on consignment. To make room for the incoming season, unsold merchandise is marked down quickly, then shipped to discount houses. A VIP designer: &quot;Can't make a living anymore. Nobody purchases retail.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bits &amp; pieces </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SPIKE Lee, who's newie movie's &quot;Chi-Raq&quot;: &quot;Chicago's the homicide capital of the world&quot; . . . GLORIA Vanderbilt, 91, getting HBO's documentary on her life and loves and loves and more loves. Years back, I remember Philippines' First Lady Imelda Marcos' East Side townhouse. She and Gloria playing with jewels and ropes of pearls stacked in an open trunk. I doubt that's in HBO's coming doc. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fighting for journos </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  EVERYONE in trouble knocks the media. Always. It's their first zap. Mark Ruffalo in the film &quot;Spotlight&quot; says the media fights for the little guy. &quot;Reporters are the last defense against tyranny.&quot; Thank you, Mark. Everyone else: Pay attention. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To eat or no? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SELENA Gomez: &quot;Victoria's Secret models make you want to work out and never eat anything&quot; . . . JOHN Catsimatidis inviting 100 eaters for Chinese New Year buffet, 8 to 11 p.m. Our Place </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chalet, East 79th. If you're not invited, not my fault . . . MAR-a-Lago charity auction. Besides the Candidate and more security than Iowa has corn, one guest bought Mrs. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a bracelet, saying, &quot;We know she liked it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AN American five minutes, that creature looking to lead America by zapping its No. 1 city, New York, New York? Cruz rhymes with Shih Tzus. Stick a muzzle on him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thought up only in New York, kids, only in New York. </SPAN></P>
