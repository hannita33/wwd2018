<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What's going to happen in 2017? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I made a very bold call last year in predicting that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would win the presidency - or, more precisely, that Hillary Clinton would lose. I'm not feeling quite that daring, or lucky, when it comes to my outlook for the coming year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But I'll still dip my little toe into the shallow end of the forecasting pool. So here goes nothin'. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I think the president-elect will start off smoothly in his relations with other Republicans - pomp and circumstance and all that. But unless </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> calms down both his rhetoric and his policies, there will be friction within just a few months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments on nuclear weapons proliferation will be only one major issue of contention. Even if other politicians agree with his view that the US can out-nuke anyone else in the world, that won't be an issue </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is likely to get much public backing on. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's not really a germane topic for this column. But there's another bombshell issue that is: the economy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has called for a massive spending program - mainly for infrastructure improvements throughout the US - that he says will get the economy moving again.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Great idea, if the new president has found a magic way to pay for all this spending that nobody else has thought of.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If he hasn't, any big spending bills are likely to be blocked in Congress. Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan simply aren't going to bend on this issue and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is going to come up with an empty wallet for his big plans.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, the very fact that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is talking about adding to the already massive $20 trillion US debt load will likely spook the financial markets eventually and cause interest rates to continue rising.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Just when will that happen? Your guess is as good as mine.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite common belief, most interest rates aren't really controlled by the Federal Reserve. Rates are dictated by the demand for money worldwide and concern over future inflationary pressures. And you can track that by looking at the bond market, where rates began rising months before the Fed's recent increase.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> talk about spending massively will press the inflation button in the minds of the financial world. And that'll mean higher borrowing costs even if the Fed backtracks (as I think it will) on its promise of three rate hikes next year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> desire to pick a fight with the Chinese could also be a problem in 2017. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   For years I've been ranting about Chinese goods, especially counterfeits, coming into the US. But this isn't the time for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to begin this battle.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Right now the Chinese own about $1.35 trillion in US debt. In recent months, the Chinese have been selling some of that debt, although the reasons for the sales are unclear.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Beijing were to decide to sell more or all of its US holdings and, worse, not buy any more debt, interest rates in the US would go up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continues to antagonize </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and causes retaliation, there's no telling what kind of chaos might happen in interest rates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most Americans didn't like Russia messing with the election. They aren't going to like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fooling with our financial markets any better.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If, by luck, the world economy suddenly starts to perk up at the same time the US is still hearing about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spending plans, interest rates could go ballistic.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Won't happen, you say? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Well, anyone who lived through the rate hikes of the early 1980s knows that it can happen. Back then, interest rates became double-digit quickly.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A number of things will occur if that happens. One, many of those people who have been forced into the stock market might suddenly find the high interest rates in bonds much more appealing. So, stock prices will go down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What I'm trying to say is simple: If all this happens, it will be a mess.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When similar messes were about to happen - like when the Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell nearly 800 points on election night as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory became clear - someone came to the markets' rescue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another rescue effort could happen if all the dark forces I mentioned above conspired against the financial markets. Or there might be no rescue the next time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the smartest moves for any incoming president is to acknowledge all the problems up front. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be wise, for instance, to allow the economy to weaken if that's what it is doing anyway without any heroic rescue efforts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For a few months, he will be able to blame President Obama and people will believe him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And the same goes for the financial markets. If stocks and bonds get routed, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can again blame his predecessor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But six months from now, Obama will be a distant memory and the blame will shift to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's when the new president's relations with even his own party could get really strained. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That, anyhow, is what I think could happen in 2017. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Plus, I think the Yankees and Mets could both make it to the World Series. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Have a Happy New Year, everyone. </SPAN></P>
