<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Military desk: Will </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Really Purge the Generals? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Candidate Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repeatedly vowed to get rid of the nation's top senior military officials within 30 days of taking office. But that, warns The Washington Post's Josh Rogin, &quot;could provoke a crisis in civil-military relations at the very beginning of his presidency.&quot; For one thing, &quot;an immediate and thorough housecleaning could provoke pushback from the military and accusations of political interference.&quot; Moreover, &quot;a purge of generals based on their willingness to support a president's policies would be a dangerous endeavor that flew in the face of military culture and tradition.&quot; But &quot;if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does decide to dismiss generals in an unprecedented way, there's not much that could be done to stop him.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Security expert: Let </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been president-elect for barely a week, and &quot;the same pundits who said he could never win are making it sound like his presidency has already failed,&quot; writes James S. Robbins in USA Today. They say his transition is in disarray, he hasn't produced &quot;a set of developed proposals&quot; and is backing away from campaign positions. Yet before his own inauguration, Bill Clinton &quot;managed to flip-flop on his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy, water down his promised middle-class tax cut and abandon his pledge to admit Haitian refugees.&quot; Plus, two of his Cabinet picks were mired in scandal. Meanwhile, &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is sprinting down the track compared with Ronald Reagan's laid-back transition.&quot; Says Robbins: &quot;People in a hurry to declare </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency failed should at least have the courtesy to first let it begin.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Historian: What MacArthur Would Tell </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The incoming president should turn for advice to someone who's been dead for more than 50 years - Gen. Douglas MacArthur, &quot;who actually has a lot in common with Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and should be one of his role models.&quot; That's the judgment of MacArthur biographer Arthur Herman, writing for Fox News. Like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the hero of World War II and Korea &quot;was a maverick, an anti-establishment figure&quot; who faced the &quot;opposition of America's political elites, who saw him as vain and arrogant.&quot; Herman suggests the general would offer these four pieces of advice, based on his own experience: &quot;First, stand your ground.&quot; Second, &quot;trust your gut.&quot; Third, &quot;know your enemy.&quot; And finally, &quot;keep your word.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Conservative: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Should Govern Like Harding </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Warren Harding was &quot;a problematic president&quot; who &quot;wasn't particularly well-qualified&quot; for the job, notes William Kristol in The Weekly Standard. But there's one way in which he was impressive - and it's a lesson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should learn: &quot;His administration was stocked with (mostly) well-qualified men who served with considerable distinction.&quot; Kristol cites Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes and Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, &quot;whose tax reforms and deregulatory efforts spurred years of economic growth.&quot; Moreover, his &quot;first two Supreme Court appointments - William Howard Taft and George Sutherland - were distinguished.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should focus on Harding's successes, but also his &quot;failures, particularly the scandals that exploded into public view after Harding's sudden death&quot; - scandals caused by &quot;cronies&quot; who &quot;betrayed his trust and tarnished his reputation.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  FEC ex-member: Lose 'Money Buys Elections' Clich&eacute; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory does nothing else, it should put to rest the hoary argument that &quot;money buys elections,&quot; writes former Federal Elections Commissioner Bradley Smith in The Washington Examiner. After all, &quot;Clinton's campaign outspent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by more than two-to-one. Pro-Clinton ads outnumbered pro-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ads by three-to-one. Independent groups (the 'super PACs') supporting Clinton outspent independent groups supporting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by three-to-one.&quot; And even before 2016, well-heeled candidates like Jon Corzine, Meg Whitman and Linda McMahon had lost races. Fact is, &quot;money is simply the facilitator by which candidates speak to voters, but voters will make up their own minds.&quot; And &quot;money simply can't make up for a message that people aren't interested in.&quot; - Compiled by Eric Fettmann </SPAN></P>
