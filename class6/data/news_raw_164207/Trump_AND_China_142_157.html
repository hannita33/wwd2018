<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hillary Clinton was finally asked a direct question at Wednesday's debate about the conflicts of interest between the Clinton Foundation and her work as secretary of state, but &quot;more or less avoided the question,&quot; writes David A. Graham at The Atlantic. And Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;effectively let her off the hook,&quot; proving yet again that &quot;she has gotten very lucky&quot; in this election. Yet &quot;the point of ethics guidelines is to avoid even the impression that there might be shady business, and in the case of the Clinton Foundation, that did not work.&quot; The issue &quot;won't go away&quot; if she's elected. &quot;It will become more important.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the right: Chris Wallace's Moderating Lesson </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fox News' Chris Wallace caught a lot of pre-debate heat when he promised not to fact-check the candidates during Wednesday's face-off, so &quot;he must feel vindicated&quot; now that he's getting rave reviews, writes Paul Crookston at National Review. &quot;He was at once the fairest moderator of the cycle and the one who drew the most substance out of the candidates,&quot; pressing them &quot;on their positions not by contradicting their facts, as previous moderators had, but by asking questions with policy specifics&quot; and posing &quot;questions that were narrow rather than loaded.&quot; At a time &quot;when trust in the news media has slipped down to 32 percent,&quot; says Crookston, &quot;Wallace demonstrated how the industry can regain some lost respect.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Policy wonk: De Blasio's Mental-Health Blind Spot </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mayor de Blasio &quot;wasted no time&quot; before blaming the police sergeant involved in this week's fatal shooting of an emotionally disturbed woman, writes Seth Barron in City Journal. And &quot;it may well be the case&quot; that the cop &quot;made serious errors.&quot; But the &quot;real mistake,&quot; says Barron, &quot;was the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's neglect of Deborah Danner's serious mental illness.&quot; After all, her case &quot;was known to the city&quot; and she &quot;didn't take her anti-psychotic medicine.&quot; Kendra's Law has &quot;proven effective at keeping the mentally ill out of hospitals and shelters and promoting compliance with doctor's orders,&quot; notes Barron. It's &quot;a working solution to the problems of people like Deborah Danner, but the mayor refuses to use it.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Foreign desk: Filipino's Flip-Flop a US Disaster </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Philippines &quot;is America's oldest ally in Asia, and until recently one of the closest,&quot; notes Max Boot in Foreign Policy. But its new &quot;crude populist&quot; president, Rodrigo Duterte, is transforming that relationship &quot;in a fundamental and worrying manner.&quot; He &quot;journeyed to Beijing this week to announce his 'separation from the United States' in military and economic terms,&quot; declaring that &quot;a new alliance of the Philippines, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Russia would emerge.&quot; Why the flip-flop into Beijing's bed, given that &quot;the Philippine people remain largely pro-American&quot;? Says Boot: &quot;It is a product of his peculiar psychology.&quot; Yet this spells potential disaster, since Washington may now &quot;find itself hard-pressed to hold the 'first island chain' in the Western Pacific&quot; whose defense &quot;has been a linchpin of US strategy since the Cold War.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mideast view: Jerusalem's Walls, Breached Again </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Israel's latest archeological discovery - the site where the Romans breached Jerusalem's walls during the great Jewish revolt in the year 70 - normally would only be of academic interest. But not now, writes Jonathan Tobin in Commentary. Because in light of UNESCO's recent vote to deny the Jewish history of the Temple Mount, it's &quot;another reminder of the insidious nature of the war still being waged to extinguish the rebirth of Jewish sovereignty in the Jewish homeland.&quot; As Tobin notes, &quot;all you have to do to prove the existence of historic Jewish ties to Jerusalem is to start digging virtually anywhere in the city or, for that matter, anywhere in the country.&quot; Which is why the Palestinians &quot;are so quick to resist archeological work,&quot; especially in Jerusalem. </SPAN></P>
