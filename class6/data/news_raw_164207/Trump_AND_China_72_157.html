<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama stabbed Israel in the back Friday by refusing to block a contentious UN Security Council resolution that demands the Jewish state cease all development in occupied territories. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, the hostile measure passed with US Ambassador Samantha Power abstaining. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The resolution was first introduced by Egypt in cooperation with the Palestinians to consider settlement building in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank &quot;a flagrant violation under international law.&quot;  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fourteen of the 15 other members of the Security Council voted in favor of the resolution. Its approval was met with sustained applause in the chamber. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A &quot;no&quot; vote by the US or any of the other four permanent members of the council - Russia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> France or Great Britain - would have killed it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The US vetoed a similar resolution in 2011.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The White House said on Friday that Obama made the final decision. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Our position is that there is one president at a time,&quot; said Ben Rhodes, the White House national security adviser. &quot;President Obama is the president until Jan. 20, and we are taking this action of course as US policy.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   He added that the administration is &quot;certain&quot; President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will take a different tack when he becomes commander in chief in January.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moments after the vote, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who on Thursday sided with Israel by opposing the resolution, vowed that US policies regarding the Middle East would soon change. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweeted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A vote had initially been planned on the resolution for Thursday, but Egypt backed off under pressure from Israel and a phone call from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, hearing that the White House may either abstain from the vote or would not veto the measure, began a flurry of diplomatic maneuvers and reached out to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to enlist his support, sources said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Thursday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweeted, &quot;The resolution being considered at the United Nations Security Council regarding Israel should be vetoed.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Egypt backed out to give </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a chance to weigh in as president, four other members of the Security Council - New Zealand, Malaysia, Venezuela and Senegal - went ahead and reintroduced it.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The White House defended its position on Friday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Addressing the council afterward, Power said the &quot;Security Council reaffirmed its established consensus that settlements have no legal validity.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The United States has been sending the message that the settlements must stop - privately and publicly - for nearly five decades,&quot; she continued. &quot;So our vote today is fully in line with the bipartisan history of how American presidents have approached both the issue - and the role of this body.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She also said the settlements have gotten so far out of control that they are endangering the two-state solution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;One has to make a choice between settlements and separation,&quot; Power said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But incoming Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer slammed for letting Israel twist in the wind. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Whatever one's views are on settlements, the UN is the wrong forum to settle these issues. The UN has been a fervently anti-Israel body since the days of 'Zionism is racism,' and, unfortunately, that fervor has never diminished,&quot; the New York senator said in a statement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Knowing this, past administrations - both Democratic and Republican - have protected Israel from the vagaries of this biased institution.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Netanyahu also blasted the vote.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Israel rejects this shameful anti-Israel resolution at the UN and will not abide by its terms,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Palestinian Authority called the anti-Israel action a &quot;a day of victory.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An Israeli official on Friday suggested that the Obama administration helped orchestrate the resolution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  PRESIDENT OBAMA'S BIGGEST SLIGHTS TO ISRAEL </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2009: Obama tells the U.N. America does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements,&quot; but offers no serious criticism of Palestinians. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2010: Makes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leave through a side door after chilly White House meeting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2011: Demands Israel negotiate with the Palestinian Authority - governed by Hamas and Fatah - with pre1967 border lines. Former Mayor Ed Koch said Obama threw &quot;Israel under the bus.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2015: Nominates Sen. Chuck Hagel, a leading critic of Israel, as defense secretary. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Pentagon leaks information that Israel attacked the Damascus, Syria, airport to stop a shipment of weapons to terrorist groups. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama officials apologize for the leak, because it endangered American lives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2014: Three Jewish teens, including an American, are kidnapped and murdered by Hamas. Obama administration calls for restraint. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * In middle of shooting war in the Gaza Strip, Obama administration tightens arms shipments to Israel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Obama officials are quoted in The Atlantic as calling Netanyahu a &quot;chickenst.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2015: Obama refuses to meet with Netanyahu when the Israeli leader addresses Congress. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Doesn't immediately call Netanyahu after the Israeli leader wins reelection. Criticizes his &quot;divisive rhetoric&quot; about Arab Israelis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Over Israel's objections, cuts a deal with Iran to postpone development of nuclear weapons. Netanyahu opposed the accord &quot;because it doesn't prevent Iran from getting nukes . . . It paves the way for Iran to get nuclear weapons.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yesterday: Refuses to block a UN resolution condemning Israeli settlements, with US Ambassador Samantha Power voting to abstain (left) and allowing the measure to pass.  </SPAN></P>
