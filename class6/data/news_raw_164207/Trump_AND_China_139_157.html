<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Eloise had better get ready for a new landlord - the historic Plaza hotel will hit the auction block next month, according to a &shy;report Wednesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The foreclosure auction was triggered after 75 percent owner Sahara India Pariwar - an Indian conglomerate whose chairman was imprisoned in 2014 for defrauding investors - defaulted on loan agreements, Bloomberg News reported. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A second luxury hotel property, the Dream Downtown, located near the High Line in Chelsea, will be sold with The Plaza as part of a package, the report said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The two properties' mortgage is currently held by billionaire brothers David and Simon Reuben, who have reportedly scheduled a foreclosure auction for April 26. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Built in 1907, the five-star Plaza has 282 hotel rooms and 152 privately owned condo units. But only the hotel, restaurants and retail shops will be sold.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Reubens have been talking about an auction for a long time without actually putting mallet to block, skeptical hotel-industry insiders told The Post on Wednesday. But if the auction occurs, the price could top $1 billion, they said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The Baccarat just went for $2 million a key,&quot; one hotel developer told The Post of the new West 53rd Street luxury hotel, which sold for $230 million last month to a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-based &shy;insurance group. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The Plaza will likely go for more,&quot; as much as $3 million a key or more, &quot;due to its trophy location on Fifth Avenue and its history,&quot; the source said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It's been a dirty little secret that The Plaza has been headed to foreclosure,&quot; an industry source said, adding that &quot;there are some offers in the wings.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Plaza - and its famous, fictional resident, children's-book character Eloise - has had many owners, including Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
