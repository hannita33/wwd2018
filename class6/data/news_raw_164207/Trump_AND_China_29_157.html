<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Michael Ledeen at PJ Media says Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can send a powerful message by inviting an Iranian ayatollah to his inauguration. Specifically, Ayatollah Hossain Boroujerdi, recently released from prison after a decade behind bars. Boroujerdi &quot;is one of those dissidents who are so beloved by the Iranian people that the murderous regime of Ali Khamenei does not dare to put them to death or even on trial.&quot; He has &quot;repeatedly criticized the fundamentalist doctrines of the Iranian theocratic state, and has dramatically spoken about the most explosive issues in the Muslim world, including anti-Semitism.&quot; Inviting him to the inauguration would &quot;deliver a stunning message to the Islamic world&quot; and &quot;show that we understand that there are freedom-loving Muslims.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chinese leaders &quot;have been remarkably quiet&quot; since the election, despite Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> signaling that &quot;his administration will pursue policies fundamentally disadvantageous&quot; to Beijing, notes Gordon Chang at The National Interest. Some suspect they're &quot;merely lying in wait, but there are signs they have themselves been ambushed and still do not know how to react to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; His two immediate predecessors &quot;pursuing misguided approaches, tried to minimize&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> initial provocations. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, by publicly taking a call from Taiwan's president, &quot;turned the tables on Beijing, striking the Chinese even before the swearing-in.&quot; As a result, he's &quot;unnerving overly confident Chinese officials.&quot; The Chinese &quot;have just met someone impossible for them to intimidate.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the right: That Intel Report's Missing Word </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An important word is missing from the joint intelligence report on Russia's alleged election-based cyberattacks, notes Andrew McCarthy at National Review: &quot;Podesta.&quot; And the failure to even mention Hillary Clinton's campaign chief, John Podesta, whose e-mails were hacked, is &quot;significant . . . in light of the intelligence community's recent history of politicizing its analyses.&quot; Because &quot;influencing elections&quot; usually means disinformation, not publicizing &quot;true but embarrassing information.&quot; And the report &quot;pointedly declines to tell us what specific information gives them such 'high confidence' &quot; Vladimir Putin was behind it. In fact, it &quot;concludes that while Putin appears to have been rooting for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; Moscow &quot;assumed Clinton was going to win&quot; and was &quot;mainly trying to undermine . . . her anticipated presidency, not swing the election to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Crime wonk: Black Lives Matter and the Torture Tape </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Heather Mac Donald at City Journal disagrees with those &quot;incensed at the suggestion that the Black Lives Matter movement could have influenced the behavior of the four individuals in Chicago who tortured a disabled white man for hours.&quot; In fact, she says, the blame lies with &quot;the reign of racial victimology, inner-city gang culture and black anti-white animus.&quot; Because &quot;we live in Ta-Nehesi Coates's America, characterized by the assumption that blacks are the eternal targets of lethal white oppression.&quot; And Black Lives Matter is &quot;just a more in-your-face manifestation&quot; of this concept. She says &quot;the establishment typically looks the other way at manifestations of black anti-white animus.&quot; But &quot;the violence in the Chicago torture video does not arise in a vacuum.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Conservative take: Sensible Plea for Immigration Limits </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  People who want less immigration - 38 percent in a recent Gallup Poll, versus 21 percent who want more - traditionally &quot;have been underrepresented in the US Congress,&quot; argues Ramesh Ponnuru at Bloomberg View. Now Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) appears to be succeeding Attorney General-designate Jeff Sessions &quot;as the Senate's foremost immigration restrictionist.&quot; Yes, he overstates his case, but &quot;he's probably right&quot; when he says that &quot;low-skilled immigration puts downward pressure on wages at the bottom of the labor market and that reducing it would relieve that pressure.&quot; It would &quot;help low-wage workers and promote assimilation and social cohesion.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
