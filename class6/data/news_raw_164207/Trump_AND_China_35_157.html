<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Iran warns it will destroy Israel and start World War III if Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tears up the nuclear deal. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> calls him &quot;as ignorant as a child&quot; and threatens to end all cooperation if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't recognize Taiwan as part of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then there are the Hillary Clinton Democrats, who are trying to steal the election they lost. Some fellow Republicans also are breaking with the president-elect over Russian hacking allegations and his selection of oilman Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If you blinked, you missed the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> honeymoon. He hasn't taken office, yet already, the long knives are out for him.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The conflicts could be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> baptism by fire, except he ran an endless gantlet of fire during the 18-month campaign. Numerous reports of his demise were not premature, they were flat-out wrong.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I suspect something similar is happening now. The whole world looks to be having a nervous breakdown over his early actions, and many Americans are wondering if the wheels are about to come off the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> train. Some on the left, including those in the White House, certainly hope so and are doing all they can to delegitimize his victory and undermine democracy. If only they treated America's enemies so ruthlessly.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, the good news is that they hope and scheme in vain. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shows no signs of going wobbly, and while he doesn't always keep calm, he does carry on.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has taken the most vicious pounding of any candidate in modern times, and still pulled off one of the great upsets in political history. Why would he buckle now? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the late Mayor Ed Koch once said of himself: I give ulcers, I don't get them. So it is with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He takes pleasure in driving his opponents crazy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If he were the appeasing sort, he would back off now, say soothing things to make the hysterics feel better, and pledge to play nice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fortunately, that's not the man America elected. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a master negotiator, and now that he has the attention of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Iran and Democrats, he will try to use that as leverage to cut better deals for national security and working Americans.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is also a pure disrupter, the greatest threat to politics-as-usual ever to win the Oval Office. He may want to negotiate, or he may keep plowing ahead until he gets all that he wants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The other party never knows which side of him they're getting. Is he looking to make a deal, or does he want it all?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His life story shows examples of both. The title of his first book is &quot;The Art of the Deal,&quot; but one of the most striking statements in it is this: &quot;My style of deal-making is quite simple and straightforward. I aim very high, and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I'm after.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That was in 1987. His job has changed, but he's still pushing to get what he's after. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's why he won the election. Most of the voters in 30 states wanted change, and he was the clear change agent. But change of the magnitude they want and he seeks - wholesale change, at home and abroad - can't happen smoothly. Many eggs must be broken to rearrange the power structure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The architects of the status quo, including the mainstream media, establishment leaders of both parties, as well as hostile powers such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Iran, have everything to lose from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agenda. Most of his changes will come at their expense, so they can be expected to fight him all the way, as they are now. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's fine, that's how the Founders devised the separation of powers, and that's the way the world works - everybody pursues their own interests.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will not always prevail, or always be right. His election was an urgent course correction, but sometimes, the correction will need to be corrected. The key is for him to keep his bond with the American people by speaking directly to them, and listening to what they say in return.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Remember, too, we are in the early stages of the battle for America's renewal. Whatever you do, don't be a spectator. And always be prepared to be surprised.  </SPAN></P>
