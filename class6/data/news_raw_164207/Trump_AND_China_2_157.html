<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> launched a Twitter attack against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on several issues Sunday - as reports emerged saying that his controversial call with Taiwan was meant to be an intentional slap in the face to the communist nation.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several insiders who helped plan Friday's historic chat told The Washington Post that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been secretly plotting to provoke the superpower for months and that the conversation with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen had been in the works for weeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Staffers from both sides reportedly knew the call would spark outrage, the sources said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;They knew that there would be reaction and potential blowback,&quot; Stephen Yates, a former national-security official and expert on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Taiwan, told The Post.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Once the call was scheduled, I was told that there was a briefing for President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokesman from President Tsai's office added, &quot;Of course both sides agreed ahead of time before making contact.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The call between the United States and Taiwan - a diplomatic first since 1979 - was part of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new strategy to send a message to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the new president intended to play rough, the insiders said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Right after the billionaire won the election, his campaign team began compiling a list of foreign leaders to speak with in the weeks to follow, and the Chinese rival was reportedly one of his top choices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Very early on, Taiwan was on that list,&quot; Yates said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired off a pair of tweets Sunday - blasting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for devaluing America's currency and taxing US products - which seemed to reflect his new strategy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Did </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea?&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wrote at about 5:30 p.m. &quot;I don't think so!&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The &quot;military complex&quot; reference was apparently aimed at an artificial reef the Chinese have built in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea that can support a military base.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has accused the Chinese in the past of currency manipulation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the big abuser,&quot;he said during the campaign, calling Beijing and other nations &quot;grand masters at monetary manipulation.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sunday's tweets came after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lodged a complaint with the United States on Saturday over the call with Taiwan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> considers Taiwan to be part of its nation, and in deference to that, the United States has walked a fine line and not had top-level talks with Taiwanese leaders in a generation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> camp has chosen to downplay the phone call, with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and aides coming to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> defense Sunday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He took the call, accepted her congratulations and good wishes and it was precisely that,&quot; Pence said Sunday on ABC's &quot;This Week.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> former campaign manager, told &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; that &quot;it was just a phone call.&quot; </SPAN></P>
