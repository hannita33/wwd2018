<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gave his first foreign-policy speech on Wednesday, attacking President Obama and Hillary Clinton for their &quot;reckless, rudderless and aimless&quot; strategies while vowing, if elected, to take a more &shy;restrained, non-interventionist &shy;approach. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. &quot;The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot; 'America first' will be the major and overriding theme of my administration,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;No American citizen will ever feel that their needs come second to a citizen of a foreign country . . . I will be America's greatest defender and most loyal champion.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   If the theme was familiar, the delivery was not. A newly presidential </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> adopted a serious tone and relied on a teleprompter instead of speaking off the cuff, as he has on the campaign trail. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism . . . I'm skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down. And under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs,&quot; he said, citing the North American Free Trade Agreement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Setting up a November showdown with Clinton - who is more hawkish than Obama - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sought to portray himself as a disciplined leader who would steer clear of nation-building at the expense of US interests.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   He charged that the Clinton-Obama team created chaos by meddling abroad, citing the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, the intervention in Libya and stepped-up military action in Syria. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He singled out then-Secretary of State Clinton's handling of the deadly attacks on the US compound in Benghazi, Libya. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign-policy vision of Obama-Clinton,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told an audience at The Mayflower hotel in Washington, DC. &quot;It has been a complete and total disaster.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also pointed to the threat posed by ISIS, the US's relationship with Israel and the danger radical Islam poses to the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He pledged his presidency would focus on &quot;regional stability - not radical change&quot; - in the Middle East. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> blamed administrations after Ronald Reagan's - which included that of Republican George W. Bush - for veering &quot;badly off course.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign-policy disaster after another,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;They just kept coming and coming. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama's line in the sand in Syria.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> urged no restraint when it came to wiping out terrorists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Simple message for ISIS: Their days are numbered. I won't tell them where, I won't tell them how . . . We, as a nation, must be more unpredictable,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fresh off a sweep of five East Coast primaries, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sought to expand on foreign-policy views that have lacked detail and led critics to contend he wasn't presidential. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke to an invited audience of conservative-leaning national-security experts, as well as foreign-policy writers and politicians. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">TRUMP</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DOCTRINE </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Steer foreign policy in a noninterventionist direction while protecting America's interests. &quot;We're getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * America first: &quot;We will no longer surrender this country, or its people, to the false song of globalism.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Convene a summit with NATO and convince member nations to pay their fair share of expenses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Stop trying to make Western-style democracies out of unwilling countries in the Middle East. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Ease tensions with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Russia: &quot;Some say the Russians won't be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can't make a good deal for America, then we will quickly walk from the table.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Defeat ISIS: &quot;I have a simple message for them: Their days are numbered. I won't tell them where and I won't tell them how. We must, as a nation, be more unpredictable.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Build up military, but deploy as a last resort. &quot;I will never send our finest into battle unless necessary - and will only do so if we have a plan for victory. Our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction.&quot; </SPAN></P>
