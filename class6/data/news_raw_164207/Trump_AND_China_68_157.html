<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Facebook has developed censorship software that will allow the social-media site to operate in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where it's been blocked since 2009, reports Kara Alaimo at The Washington Post. Yes, she says, &quot;giving in to the demands of an undemocratic regime to obstruct free speech would set a dangerous precedent.&quot; But even a restricted Facebook &quot;could ultimately destabilize the Chinese Communist Party.&quot; For one thing, it would finally allow Chinese people to connect to Western platforms and discuss sensitive topics more openly. But &quot;the most subversive part&quot; would be allowing them to &quot;see how people in other parts of the world live.&quot; Because after watching those people &quot;lambaste their leaders, practice a plurality of religions and give birth to multiple children with impunity, the Chinese might demand to do the same.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election &quot;ushers in a new challenge for homeland security and counterterrorism both at home and abroad,&quot; says the Cato Institute's A. Trevor Thrall. After all, the president-elect's name is on &quot;scores of properties all over the United States and the world.&quot; Which makes them &quot;vulnerable 'soft targets,' without any of the serious security measures surrounding American embassies or other government buildings.&quot; Indeed, several &quot;are located in countries with significant serious civil unrest and instability,&quot; including many Muslim nations. And the &quot;symbolic damage&quot; of an attack on such targets &quot;would be immense.&quot; The possibility has &quot;political and security implications that go well beyond the legal question&quot; of who should defend them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the right: Thank you, Thomas Sowell </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Michelle Malkin at Real Clear Politics pens a tribute to Dr. Thomas Sowell, who's retiring at age 86 after more than three decades as a syndicated columnist (whose work often appeared on these pages). She recalls first reading Sowell's writings in college when that was considered &quot;a subversive act.&quot; And &quot;it remains so today,&quot; because &quot;the prolific libertarian economist's vast body of work is a clarion rejection of all the liberal intelligentsia hold dear.&quot; Particularly the &quot;corrosive . . . concept of perpetual and permanent racial victimhood,&quot; and how Sowell showed that &quot;elites profit mightily at the expense of the alleged beneficiaries of government-coerced affirmative action.&quot; His &quot;assessments were rooted not in fear or hatred or fanaticism or moral superiority, but in empirical evidence.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  John Kerry's blast at Israel may have been &quot;an act of liberation,&quot; allowing him to say &quot;things in public that US diplomats usually say only behind closed doors.&quot; But Eli Lake at Bloomberg suggests the secretary of state's speech actually showed him to be &quot;a man trapped in the past&quot; - the &quot;prisoner of a peace process from a bygone time.&quot; Because &quot;2016 is not 1999&quot; and &quot;the Middle East is coming unglued.&quot; Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, the return of Russia and the growth of ISIS &quot;have nothing to do with settlements in the West Bank.&quot; Says Lake: &quot;It's worth marveling at the spectacle of Kerry's dire warnings about the survival of a peace process disconnected from the wars raging all around it.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election &quot;supposedly shocked the leadership of The New York Times into self-reflection, if not an outright reassessment of the way it reports on America and its politics.&quot; In fact, notes Warren Henry at The Federalist, editor Dean Baquet vowed to &quot;remind ourselves that New York is not the real world.&quot; But &quot;the problem with these mea culpas and modified, limited hang-outs,&quot; he says, &quot;is that anyone familiar&quot; with the paper's history &quot;has seen this movie before.&quot; Which is why its coverage of the supposed hate-crime surge and its treatment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cabinet appointments only &quot;fuel the hysteria in the sort of people who treat The New York Times or the Southern Poverty Law Center as gospel.&quot; - Compiled by Eric Fettmann </SPAN></P>
