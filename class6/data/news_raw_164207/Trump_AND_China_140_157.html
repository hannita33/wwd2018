<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More than half the private citizens who got face time or spoke with Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state forked over bundles of cash to the Clinton Foundation, a new investigation revealed Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At least 85 of the 154 nongovernment fat cats who got access to Clinton donated to her family charity or promised to back its programs, either personally or through businesses or other groups, according to a review of State Department documents by The Associated Press. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Combined, the donors shelled out as much as $156 million, with at least 40 donating more than $100,000 each and 20 giving more than $1 million - more evidence that the family's foundation doubled as a pay-for-play operation for those seeking access to Clinton, critics charge. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donors granted time with Clinton included: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  n  A famed economist who asked for her help as the Bangladeshi government pressured him to resign from a nonprofit bank. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  n  A Wall Street big shot who sought Clinton's help with a visa problem. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   n  Est&eacute;e Lauder executives who met with Clinton while her department worked with the firm's corporate charity to counter gender-based violence in South Africa. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Analysts said the revelations offer further proof that State under Clinton was rife with conflicts of interest because of its deep ties to the foundation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The real conflicts of interest and appearances of conflicts are legion. This is proof positive the foundation should be shut if Clinton is elected president,&quot; Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, told The Post. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pounced on the revelations during a speech in Texas as further evidence of the Democratic nominee's shoddy ethics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;America can never elect a candidate who, like Hillary Clinton, did government favors for those giving her family and her foundation massive amounts of cash,&quot; he said, calling the investigation's results &quot;the tip of the iceberg.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Call logs show that Slim-Fast billionaire S. Daniel Abraham, a Clinton fund-raising bundler and foundation donor, was listed in her date books for eight meetings.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi economist who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for pioneering low-interest micro-credit for poor business owners, met with Clinton three times and spoke with her by phone during a period when the Bangladeshi government was investigating his oversight of a nonprofit bank. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He ultimately was pressured to resign from the bank's board. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Throughout the process, he pleaded for help in messages routed to Clinton, who ordered aides to find ways to assist him. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And after his meetings with Clinton, she warned the Bangladeshi government in a speech that &quot;we do not want to see any action taken that would in any way undermine or interfere in the operations of the Grameen Bank.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   She went unheeded. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In another case, Clinton was host at a September 2009 breakfast meeting at the New York Stock Exchange that listed Blackstone Group Chairman Stephen Schwarzman - a major foundation donor - as one of the attendees.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   A day after the breakfast, according to Clinton's e-mails, the State Department was working on a visa issue at Schwarzman's request. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Blackstone donated between $250,000 and $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation, and eight Blackstone executives also gave between $375,000 and $800,000. And Blackstone's charitable arm has pledged millions of dollars in commitments to three Clinton Global Initiative projects.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Blackstone officials did not make Schwarzman available for comment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton also met in June 2011 with Nancy Mahon of MAC AIDS, the charitable arm of MAC Cosmetics, which is owned by Est&eacute;e Lauder.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The meeting occurred before an announcement about a State Department partnership to raise money to finance AIDS education and prevention.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The public-private partnership was formed to fight gender-based violence in South Africa, State said at the time. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The MAC AIDS fund donated between $5 million and $10 million to the Clinton Foundation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Est&eacute;e Lauder executive Fabrizio Freda also met with Clinton at the same Wall Street event attended by Schwarzman.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later that month, Freda was on a list of attendees for a meeting between Clinton and a US-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade group.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Est&eacute;e Lauder has given between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said the agency was not aware of any agency actions that were influenced by the Clinton Foundation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The 154 individuals who met or spoke to Clinton did not include federal employees or foreign government representatives. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The AP sought Clinton's calendar and schedules three years ago, but the department stonewalled so the wire service had to sue in federal court to get access to those materials and other records. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In another disclosure, Fox News reported that a senior executive at the foundation left almost 150 telephone messages over two years for Cheryl Mills, Clinton's top aide at the State Department. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A review of Mills' call logs shows at least 148 messages from Laura Graham, who was the Clinton Foundation's chief operating officer between 2010 and 2012.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No other individual or nonprofit appears in the logs with anything approaching that frequency or volume, according to the review of the documents, which were released to the conservative advocacy group Citizens United as part of a long-running lawsuit over a Freedom of Information Act request. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New details emerged Tuesday on the close ties between the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton's State Department:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * At least 85 of the 154 nongovernment individuals who got access to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton donated to the Clinton Foundation or promised to back its programs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Combined, the donors shelled out as much as $156 million, with at least 40 donating more than $100,000 each and 20 forking over more than $1 million. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Laura Graham, a senior executive at the foundation, left almost 150 telephone messages over two years for Cheryl Mills (left), Clinton's top aide at the State Department - more evidence of the close relationshipbetween the foundation and State. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * The Associated Press first sought Clinton's calendar and schedules three years ago, but State stonewalled and the wire service had to sue in federal court to get access to those materials and other records.  </SPAN></P>
