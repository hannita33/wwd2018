<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A furious Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday summoned America's Israeli ambassador to Jerusalem to protest the surprise US failure to block a United Nations anti-settlement resolution. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Israel's Foreign Ministry also demanded visits from the ambassadors of the countries that voted in favor of the resolution, including those from the permanent members of the Security Council - Russia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the UK and France. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The State Department said in a brief statement Sunday that Prime Minister Netanyahu and US Ambassador Dan Shapiro were to meet Sunday night. Reports confirmed the meeting took place, but did not offer any details.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Israel has accused President Obama - who broke with longstanding US policy toward its close ally - of colluding with the Palestinians against the Jewish state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;From the information that we have, we have no doubt that the Obama administration initiated it, stood behind it, coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed,&quot; Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Netanyahu said his nation was considering a &quot;plan of action&quot; against the UN, without elaborating. Israel had earlier pledged to cut millions in funding to some UN agencies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We will do all it takes so Israel emerges unscathed from this shameful decision,&quot; Netanyahu said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The resolution, which condemned Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, sparked outrage in Israel and led to a new low in the tepid relationship between Netanyahu and Obama.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet Netanyahu urged Likud ministers to stop criticizing Obama because he was worried the lame-duck Democrat could take further action to hurt Israel before he is replaced by Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Jan. 20, The Jerusalem Post reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Culture Minister Miri Regev told Army Radio that Obama let the anti-settlement resolution pass because &quot;his ego overcame his brains,&quot; the paper said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, Jerusalem's planning committee is reportedly set to approve 390 new apartment units in disputed neighborhoods. </SPAN></P>
