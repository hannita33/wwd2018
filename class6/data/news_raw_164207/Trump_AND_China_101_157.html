<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After 20 years, Colorado's unsolved 1996 killing of beauty queen JonBen&eacute;t Ramsey, age 6, is grabbing more attention than Hillary's medical records. TV stations are glueing together assorted series. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Who did it? Family? Friend? Intruder? Pathologist/coroner Dr. Michael Baden, who consulted on the now-cold case, tells me: &quot;It begat mistakes, theories, lawsuits, an arrest that produced nothing. DNA testing excluded the parents. So-called experts decided persons, now dead, did it. No one's alive to interrogate.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I always believed it was someone in the household. Kidnappers don't spend 45 minutes writing multiple pages, which is what was found in this case. That's abnormal. Ransom requests get made out in advance. Killers don't wander around a kidnapping spot looking for a crayon. Also, it demanded exactly the precise amount of the father's just-received bonus. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;There was no evidence of vaginal penetration. And the DNA was a red herring. It doesn't eliminate anyone. Local authorities said finding a stranger's DNA on the child's panties eliminated everyone close to her. No. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Suppose panties bought in Boulder were from a package handler in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That handler would leave cells on it. If I just shake your hand, a microscopic tiny amount - one or two DNA cells from me - would be on your hand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I never believed investigators should have exonerated everyone familial.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Keeping up with 'Jones's' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  IN &quot;Bridget Jones's Baby,&quot; a new familiar-old-friend film, Bridget (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) ditches Colin Firth's character for Patrick Dempsey's, and somewhere there's Emma Thompson, who once played the &quot;Hillary&quot; role in 1998's &quot;Primary Colors.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Colin: &quot;I love even movies I'm not in. I go to movie theaters, like everyone else, with my children. I saw the original 'Bridget Jones' never dreaming I'd be in a sequel. When I was cast in this I went back to see the first one again.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the Paris Theatre opening, metal detectors. Security guys with earpieces and other type pieces beneath bulging jackets. Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter, the immediate world's friend, inside a magnetometer. Hands outstretched. Doubling back to empty his pockets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Today's beauties, like Bella Hadid braless on the DKNY runway, wear no clothes. A teenager in short short shorts so short got a pat-down. Were she hiding any weapon, only a gynecologist could've found it. This, to see a beautiful lovely movie. What is our world coming to?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Odds &amp; ends </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  CIVILIZATION needs another book on the GOP candidate?

WHILE shooting &quot;Sully,&quot; Tom Hanks wore a hat to cover his grown-out naturally white hair . . . SETTLING on his vote, decorator Carleton Varney's carrying a huge canvas bag imprinted in big letters with: &quot;It's in the Bag for Lindsay.&quot; John Lindsay ran for (and then became) NYC mayor in 1965.  </SPAN></P>

A Hill devotee: &quot;We're not worrying about pneumonia. Our worry is her paranoia&quot; . . . HAVING argued for months if a presidential debate's really scheduled, how about two minutes of silence?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tax men </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  LARRY Kudlow about his new book &quot;JFK and the Reagan Revolution&quot;: &quot;Reagan took and duplicated JFK's tax-cut ideas. Supply sider Kennedy deregulated. Cutting taxes kept the dollar steady. The idea is, slash the business tax. Stop worrying about taxing the rich people. You can't tax your way into the Oval Office.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  DRUGGIST: &quot;Viagra prolongs the ability to make love.&quot; Customer: &quot;Can you get it over the counter?&quot; Druggist: &quot;Yes, but I'd need another pill.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
