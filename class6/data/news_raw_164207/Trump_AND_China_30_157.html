</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Long before Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stamped his name in gold on buildings around the world, posted snarky midnight tweets and joined the race for the White House, he was New York's most important and bravest real-estate developer. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whatever you think about his political views or crazy campaign, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't get enough credit for being a transformative planner who is in love with the city. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No matter how many times they watch &quot;Taxi Driver,&quot; younger New Yorkers and older ones who arrived recently have no idea of what the city was actually like in the mid-1970s through the mid-'90s. Notwithstanding Studio 54 and a short-lived Wall Street boom, the metropolis was reeling. Rampant street crime, AIDS, corporate flight and physical decay brought confidence to an all-time low. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Except in Battery Park City, which was then as remote as an offshore island, few other developers built anything but plain-vanilla office and apartment buildings. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - almost by force of will - rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many of his brainstorms were ahead of their time. Some - like his struggle beginning in the early 1970s to build what's now called Riverside South - were so far ahead, it can be hard to connect the dots between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> works and the neighborhood transformations they spawned and inspired years later. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His brick-and-mortar milestones are lost on those who know him mainly as a cartoonish TV personality, or are weary of his self-promotion and his omnipresent name on hotels, golf courses and casinos around the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> himself is largely to blame for being a prophet without honor in his home city. He grew weary of the risky, time-consuming development grind and started selling his name to just about any developer willing to sign a check. The result was horrible projects like the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soho Hotel which he neither built nor owns. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   His disastrous foray into Atlantic City casinos - Why, Donald? - his tacky promotion of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-made shirts and ties among other goofy ventures further cheapened his name. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The regrettable result is that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> true legacy is obscured in pointless scrutiny of what he &quot;really owns&quot; and schadenfreude over setbacks such as losing the Plaza Hotel and the Riverside South complex which he brought into being. (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a better developer than he was a dealmaker, his books on the subject to the contrary.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A more enlightened yardstick would measure what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> created and how the projects lifted all boats around them. It's time to commemorate them before he's lost to the presidency - or to the mercy of late-night TV comedians. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Here's a look at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> game-changing Manhattan monuments and their legacies.  </SPAN></P>
