<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We interrupt our regular dispatches on mendacity, chaos and polarization to bring you this special bulletin: Good news is breaking out across the country! True story. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite a push from the American wing of the anti-American movement to get traitor Edward Snowden a pardon, nobody holding important power is buying it. Not the president, not the Congress and neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They all demand that Snowden come in from the Russian cold to face criminal charges under the Espionage Act, making this a rare moment of national political unity. It is a thing of beauty worth celebrating, all the more so because the stakes are so high.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Imagine if it were a partisan wedge issue. Even a crack in the wall would give fuel to an idea that is extremely dangerous to America's national security. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That was the message sent by the House Intelligence Committee, which unanimously adopted a report saying Snowden &quot;did tremendous damage.&quot; In a bipartisan letter, the panel scoffed at claims Snowden was a hero who acted out of conscience, saying he was a disgruntled employee whose leaks of military programs helped America's enemies.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The panel said it agreed with President Obama's statement three years ago that &quot;I don't think Mr. Snowden was a patriot.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thankfully, Obama is holding firm, with press secretary Josh Earnest telling reporters that &quot;Snowden is not a whistleblower,&quot; adding that &quot;his conduct put American lives at risk . . . and the policy of the Obama administration is that Mr. Snowden should return to the United States and face the very serious charges.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The spark for the sudden interest is Oliver Stone's movie lionizing Snowden. The crackpot caucus, including George Soros, Susan Sarandon, Noam Chomsky, Cornel West and so-called human-rights groups, is using the film to demand the pardon and turn Snowden into a hero. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Their arguments turn truth upside down. The head of the American Civil Liberties Union claimed that cases like this one &quot;are precisely why the presidential pardon power exists,&quot; while an Amnesty International official said, &quot;We will need more Edward Snowdens.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ah, no on both counts. The vast majority of presidential pardons are granted only after conviction and after the applicant has served most, if not all, of his prison sentence. Because Snowden fled rather than &quot;face the music&quot; as Hillary Clinton put it, he doesn't deserve even the courtesy of consideration. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And the last thing we need are more Snowdens. Letting him off without paying a price would encourage more treasonous behavior. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After he had already bolted, Snowden was charged in 2013 with theft, &quot;unauthorized communication of national defense information&quot; and &quot;willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an unauthorized person.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He scurried first to Hong Kong, then to Vladimir Putin's Russia. He's still living there under asylum, which Putin granted to embarrass America, and almost certainly to learn everything Snowden knew.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Against that history, the claims of Snowden and his confederates that he performed a public service are laughable. Unless, of course, he meant public service to Russia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Iran and Islamic State, the beneficiaries of his disclosures.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Innocent Americans, meanwhile, were put at risk, and taxpayers had to pay many billions to develop new intelligence programs to replace those Snowden revealed.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a time when national unity is usually an oxymoron, it is heartening that national security remains at least partially sacrosanct. In addition to the united front against Snowden, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Clinton halted their campaigns for the anniversary of 9/11, just as previous candidates did. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those actions prove that America remains capable of pulling together to get the big things right. Raise a glass to more of that. </SPAN></P>
