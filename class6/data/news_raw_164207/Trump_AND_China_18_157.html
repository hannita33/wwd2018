<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has begun lining up candidates for the ultimate job interview - his vice- presidential running mate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The presumptive Republican presidential nominee is considering a list that includes a retired general and some of Washington's most powerful lawmakers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the most talked-about candidates on the billionaire's short list is Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, who met Monday with The Donald at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in Manhattan.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Corker emerged from the 80-minute meeting claiming there was no reason to believe he's on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> short list - exactly what a VP candidate is supposed to say. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We had actually never met before. . . We had a conversation,&quot; Corker told reporters. &quot;It was a good meeting about foreign policy, domestic issues.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Corker, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> discussed US relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Russia. Corker would bolster </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> perceived weakness on foreign affairs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sources said Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions - one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> earliest supporters - also is under consideration. Sessions' views on immigration match </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A surprise name on the list is retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a national security adviser to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who has emerged as one of the most buzzed about veep contenders, sources familiar with the deliberations said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Flynn retired in 2014 after a 33-year career in military intelligence that included hunting down terrorists as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Flynn would be an out-of-the- box choice because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has strongly suggested he would likely select someone connected to Congress or with elective experience to be his veep. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I think I'll probably go the political route,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said this month on MSNBC's Morning Joe. &quot;Somebody that can help me with legislation and somebody that can help me get things passed and somebody that's been friends with the senators and the congressmen and all.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But, like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the military man is not afraid to stir up controversy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In February, Flynn said Hillary Clinton should drop out of the presidential race while the FBI investigated her use of a private e-mail server. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;If it were me, I would have been out the door and probably in jail,&quot; Flynn told CNN. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Clinton campaign brushed off Flynn's comments as &quot;silly.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign manager Corey Lewandowski on Monday declined to discuss specific names being considered for vice president. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We're not going to go down that route. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is going to be the person making the final decision,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lewandowsky emphasized that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prefers &quot;someone with elective experience,&quot; which would make Flynn a dark horse. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> meeting with Corker focused mostly on &quot;foreign-policy discussions,&quot; not the vice presidency. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During a recent interview with Fox News host Greta Van Susteren, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggested as many as seven candidates were on his veep list. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   He said former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin could be contenders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is pushing for consideration in the veepstakes, sources said. </SPAN></P>
