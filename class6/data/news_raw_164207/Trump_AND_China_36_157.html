</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called Monday for a &quot;tax revolution&quot; modeled on the vision of Ronald Reagan that would slash income-tax rates, cut corporate taxes, and create millions of jobs for a new era of prosperity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;These reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan tax reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation,&quot; the GOP presidential nominee told the Detroit Economic Club. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I want to jump-start America. It can be done, and it won't even be that hard,&quot; he said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an hour-long address that also called for toughening trade policies and easing regulatory directives, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposed to simplify the tax code to just three brackets from the current seven - 12, 25 and 33 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I am proposing an across-the-board income-tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proclaimed, although the highest wage earners would see their rate fall from 39.6 percent to 33 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs or undermines our ability as a nation to compete.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposal from last year had envisioned four brackets: zero, 10, 20 and 25 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mogul also called for capping corporate taxes at 15 percent, down from the current 35 percent rate, a move long advocated by Republicans.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And he repeated common campaign themes of scrapping ObamaCare, renegotiating NAFTA, and rejecting the Trans-Pacific Partnership to stop the flow of US jobs overseas. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The speech also included a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations and revival of the Keystone pipeline project, which was killed by President Obama. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;President Obama has issued close to 400 new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> charged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said he said he would &quot;cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Detroit remarks were </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first on the economy since he announced a 13-man team of economic advisers last week, but he also said he consulted with his daughter Ivanka on how to make child care less expensive. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advocated allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxable income.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The current Child and Dependent Care tax credit is capped at 35 percent of qualifying expenses, or up to $3,000 for one child or $6,000 for two or more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He favored repealing the estate tax, or &quot;death tax,&quot; as critics call it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;No family will have to pay the death tax. American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death. It's just plain wrong,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hedge-funders would take it on the chin, as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vowed to end the &quot;carried interest loophole,&quot; which allows them to pay the lower capital-gains tax rate instead of the regular income-tax rate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But, along with everyone else, they would also get a lower overall income-tax rate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moving from taxes, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposed stronger protections for American intellectual property, pointedly accusing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of being the worst offender. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repeatedly used Detroit as an example of how Democratic policies - supported by his opponent, Hillary Clinton - have devastated American manufacturing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda. Every policy that has failed this city and so many others is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;She supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community . . . and the immigration policies that have strained local budgets and the trade deals like NAFTA . . . that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries,&quot; he charged. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The speech came after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> got tangled up in a week-long dispute with the Gold Star parents of a Muslim-American soldier who was killed in the Iraq and sparred with GOP leaders including House speaker Paul Ryan and Arizona Sen. John McCain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stephen Moore, one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> top economic advisers, said the expansive proposals should put those episodes to rest. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;When he speaks with the teleprompter and stays on message, he's very effective . . . I was highly impressed. Hopefully, it's the start of a new Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; Moore told The Post. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Clinton, campaigning in Florida, mocked the speech as nothing new. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Trickle-down economics does not help our economy grow, it does not help the vast majority of Americans, but it does really help the most wealthy. We're going to make the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes for a change,&quot; Clinton said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  YUGE CHANGES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Three tax brackets - 12%, 25% and 33% - instead of seven brackets </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * 15% tax on businesses, instead of 35%  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Fully deductible child-care expenses </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * No inheritance tax </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * 10% tax on earnings of US firms expatriated from overseas </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  * Eliminates low &quot;carried interest&quot; tax rate for hedge funds </SPAN></P>
