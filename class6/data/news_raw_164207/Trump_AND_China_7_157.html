<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even before taking office, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been good at bullying companies into keeping jobs in the US. That will win praise from voters, including me.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has, essentially, abolished the Mexican part of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, by making US companies too afraid to move south of the border.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I didn't like NAFTA when it was signed back in 1994, so good for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the president-elect has also shown a total lack of understanding about world trade issues and how his domestic policies - and even his tweets - will affect the economy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, I confronted him about the trade wars he might be causing when we met last summer. He just shrugged it off. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other presidents have picked fights with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, mostly about its human rights policies. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ignored them.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found the right nerve when he started talking directly with Taiwan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't want the island to be recognized, so </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision to ignore the so-called &quot;one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; policy has been shaking up Beijing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What our new president doesn't seem to understand is that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not only a big market for a lot of US companies but also a key partner for Washington.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> owns around $1.3 trillion of America's nearly $20 trillion in debt. Without </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> money, the US Treasury will have trouble funding its deficits.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wanted to make trouble, it could send US interest rates sharply higher and throw our economy into a tailspin. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, please be nicer to the other countries that we need.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  n  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hillary Clinton has just a few hours left to secure a pardon from President Obama. After that she takes her chances with whatever the mercurial </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has in store for her.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama has pardoned or commuted the sentences of more than 1,000 people - in fact, he's the most forgiving president in history. And while Hillary has until noon on Friday to get a pardon for any crimes she may have committed, Obama as of noon on Wednesday does not intend to pardon Madame Secretary.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why not? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One reason: He probably doesn't like her very much. The two were opponents for the White House in 2008 and harsh words were exchanged. And her appointment as secretary of state was more of a business transaction than anything else. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And, as you can probably figure out yourself, Obama likely doesn't want his legacy eroded any more than it already has been and will be as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> undoes his actions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Plus, Hillary's recklessness with her e-mails could have put Obama personally in an embarrassing situation. Months ago, I explained that Hillary needed permission from the White House to use her beloved BlackBerry inside the State Department, even though that ran afoul of security protocol.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And it was Obama, a very reliable source told me, who personally had to grant that approval.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the best reason for not giving a pardon is simple: Obama doesn't really know what kind of trouble Hillary might be in. And she would have to admit to things she might not be ready to reveal to get completely out of trouble. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On top of that, if Obama pardoned her, how would others feel who might be equally jammed up because of her possible wrongdoing? There are long lists of people who had to be complicit if crimes were committed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he would not appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary. The Clintons have been through enough, he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But that doesn't really matter. In fact, a special prosecutor would have to start from the beginning and that would slow things down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several investigations are already ongoing, including: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l    the one involving the laptop of Hillary's longtime aide Huma Abedin. The laptop was found in the apartment Abedin shared with her estranged husband, Anthony Weiner </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   l   probes into possible obstruction of justice related to the disappearance of all of Hillary's private e-mails </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l   an investigation into the now-famous &quot;secret&quot; meeting of Bill Clinton with Attorney General Loretta Lynch and a number of other things </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l   the probes into the Clinton Foundation's fundraising. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several people have come up to me and begged me to leave Hillary alone. They are liberals who were broken up about her loss.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The thing I don't understand is this: The first commandment of liberal thinking is that everyone should be treated equally in America. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And I agree totally with that.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So, why should Hillary and Bill get preferential treatment? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Should a person in rags who steals from a department store be treated more harshly than a shoplifter with a tiara? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hillary Clinton's chance for a pardon ends Friday at noon. And with the way her supporters behaved after she lost the election, I doubt that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is going to feel very compassionate.  </SPAN></P>
