</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Each day brings fresh proof that America is hopelessly headed down the wrong track and needs to change direction. Meryl Streep's pompous attack on Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his supporters at the Golden Globes is one example, and a second involves the heckling idiots who wore KKK outfits yesterday to smear Sen. Jeff Sessions during his confirmation hearing to be attorney general. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A third proof comes from the Mideast. Predictably, this one involves an Arab terrorist shedding Israeli blood.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Soon after Palestinian and Jordanian leaders railed against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plan to move our embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a Palestinian truck driver mowed down a group of Israeli soldiers, killing four and injuring 16. Witnesses said the driver plowed into the soldiers (survivors, pictured), then put his truck in reverse to run over them again.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Israeli press reports say the driver attended an East Jerusalem mosque that featured a fiery sermon against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plan. &quot;He was very angry, and said transferring the embassy would lead to war,&quot; a cousin of the driver was quoted as saying.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The driver was shot and killed, but his excuse lives on. The terror attack will be cited even by well-meaning people as a reason not to move the embassy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There's a word for such thinking - appeasement. In one form or another, appeasing Palestinians has been the policy of the United States and Europe for decades. It has failed miserably and ought to be ditched.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Palestinian appeasement means we don't do anything to stand up for ourselves or Israel that will upset the infamous Arab street. Give the bully your money and a veto over your actions and maybe he will spare your life. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration took the policy to a whole new level. It gave the Palestinians boatloads of taxpayer cash, abandoned Israel and demanded it make suicidal agreements.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All it got in exchange was more Arab violence, which it invariably responded to by pushing Israel to cede more of its sovereignty. The White House even supported opponents of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the last election.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then along comes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and, with the prospects of lasting peace fading into the realm of illusion, he decides a change is in order. True to form, he pledges a big one.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Israel supports moving our embassy because Jerusalem is its capital and embassies are almost always located in host nations' capitals. Yet while it has long been American policy to move the embassy, it never happened out of fear of stoking violence because Palestinians also claim Jerusalem as their capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So presidents accepted a stalemate and let fear stop them from doing what they should. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, thankfully, is not a fan of appeasement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He hasn't taken office yet, but already his plan has come under fire from Mahmoud Abbas, leader of the Palestinian Authority. He reportedly wrote to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to warn that the embassy move would have a &quot;disastrous impact on the peace process.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That, literally, would be impossible, since there is no peace process because Abbas refuses to negotiate with Israel. Instead, he wants the United Nations to impose borders and create a Palestinian state so he doesn't have to make any concessions to Israel, including its right to exist. Again, Obama encouraged that scam by failing to veto a UN resolution that called all Israeli settlements illegal, thus emboldening its enemies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Arab media say Abbas also sent similar letters to the European Union, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Russia urging them to prevent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from keeping his embassy promise. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Good luck with that. My guess is that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will not yield and that threats of Arab violence will only fortify his determination to chart a different course. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here at home, economic, military and immigration changes of the magnitude that voters want and that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promises are also stoking the rage of reactionaries who like the status quo. That's the way to understand the tiresome lectures and nasty protests of the establishment elite. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Amidst the storm, the rest of us must stay calm and remember this: If everything really is fine the way it is, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would have lost. His victory is a mandate for change, so bring it on. </SPAN></P>
