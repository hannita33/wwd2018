<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> public pressure on Detroit to keep auto manufacturing jobs in the US may soon include a related industry - auto part retailers, The Post has learned. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stores including Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone and O'Reilly Auto Parts operate on fat margins created by importing a large percentage of their inventory from low-cost countries, insiders said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-supported House tax reform plan takes direct aim at those margins. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If fully implemented, the border tax reform plan would prevent companies from subtracting from their gross profit the cost of goods made overseas and sold in the US, a source close to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That would increase their taxable income and squeeze their margins. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It is a pretty significant change to the code,&quot; said Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pomerleau estimates that such a border tax change could raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years - even if corporate tax rates are lowered to 20 percent.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Proponents of a border tax believe it will encourage companies to make more products domestically. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While such a tax move will affect all companies that import goods, it could impact the shares of auto parts retailers disproportionately because Wall Street, perhaps blind to the possible ramifications of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> border tax reforms, have pushed shares of the auto part chains up sharply since Election Day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One Wall Street analyst said the stock runup - Advance Auto Parts is up 25 percent since Nov. 8 - was the result of the expectation that the chains, which typically pay a 30 percent-plus tax rate, would pay lower taxes under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One analyst admitted that some may have not fully appreciated the border tax plan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We are trying to figure out how much of our product is imported,&quot; a source at one of the auto parts retailers said, referring to the potential impact of a border tax. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Auto part retailers have been increasing their margins in recent years by promoting their private-label brands, typically sourced from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other low-cost countries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AutoZone, for example, imports roughly 70 percent of its parts, a top car industry executive told The Post, requesting confidentiality. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The executive said he expected investors to take note of the change - and how it will affect the companies' profits - very soon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I bet the question will get asked [of the retailers] this quarter during conference calls with Wall Street,&quot; one analyst, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told The Post. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last year, the US imported $25 billion in auto parts from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and exported only $2.5 billion, and most of the imbalance came from aftermarket suppliers including retailers, the executive said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detroit's original equipment suppliers are not expected to be hit as hard by any import tax law changes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They make many of their parts in the US because they need to react quickly to automaker demands. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A change in the import tax law would be softened, proponents said, by a reduction in the corporate tax rate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An AutoZone spokesman said, &quot;It is just too early in the process for us to comment.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  O'Reilly declined comment, and Advance Auto did not return calls. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokesperson declined comment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stocks revved since Nov. 8: </SPAN></P>
