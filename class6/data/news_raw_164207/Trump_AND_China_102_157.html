<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a year when whipsawing markets are poised to end much higher, one of Wall Street's most curious investments could come out on top: bitcoin.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The digital currency is one of the best-performing assets of 2016, rising more than 124 percent since the start of the year - as investors in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and India push the price near all-time highs.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That far outpaces other strong-performing investments, like the Dow Jones industrial average, which has risen a solid 13.7 percent this year, to 19,819.78.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One unit of bitcoin rose to $967.99 by late Thursday, the highest level in nearly three years, and investors are waiting for it to cross the $1,000 mark.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $1,137 on Nov. 29, 2013. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It's gonna happen,&quot; Marc van der Chijs, managing partner at CrossPacific Capital and a bitcoin investor, told The Post. &quot;Whether it's going to happen before Dec. 31, nobody really knows.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Wealthy investors have fueled a surge in bitcoin as the value of the Chinese yuan and the Indian rupee have fallen since the election of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he added.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;People underestimate how important the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election is on bitcoin,&quot; van der Chijs said. &quot;People are worried. They don't really know what's going to happen.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One traditional hedge, gold, has fallen 9 percent since Nov. 8, to $1,159.55 an ounce.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The Chinese are hedging their bets,&quot; van der Chijs said.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bitcoin is still a niche market for most investors.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Created eight years ago by a mysterious cryptographer who called himself Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin gained a niche as a way for people to buy and sell goods securely and anonymously online - without the backing of a government or a central bank. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It's based on trust, based on the fact that other people see value as well,&quot; van der Chijs said. &quot;It's not backed by anything. It's backed by mathematical equations.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While it's drawn praise from technologists and market bears - including Mick Mulvaney, who is Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pick to run the Office of Management and Budget - bitcoin has been tainted by its association with shadier corners of the internet, including online drug bazaar The Silk Road and the imploded exchange Mt. Gox.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two investors who are trying to bring the digital currency to the mainstream are Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss - the twins who famously claimed to co-invent Facebook.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The &quot;Winklevii&quot; are looking to win government approval for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund next year.  </SPAN></P>
