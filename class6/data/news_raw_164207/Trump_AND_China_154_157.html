<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jessie Graff is one tough &quot;American Ninja Warrior.&quot; The 32-year-old stunt performer (&quot;Supergirl,&quot; &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;) made history in August by becoming the first woman to complete Stage 1 of the NBC show's National Finals course. Here, she tells The Post's ANDREA MORABITO about the daily diet and fitness routine that made her &quot;Ninja&quot; ready. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I never think about [exercise] as keeping in shape, I think about it as what skills do I need to be able to do and what muscles do I need to build to be strong enough to do those skills? What kind of abuse am I going to be dealing with at work, and how do I build an armor for myself to prevent injury? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I have a lifting routine - push day (bench presses, lateral raises), pull day (pullups, curls) and leg day (plyometrics, squats) - which I do six or seven days a week on a three-day cycle. In addition, I'll do an hour or two of martial arts stuff - jump kicks, spin kicks, sweeps and feet stances - if it's leg day. On pullup day, I'll go rock-climbing for two or three hours or go swimming. On push day, I'll do press handstands and boxing. There's lots of stunt-specific training and skill training that has to be mixed in as much as possible on the appropriate day, but everyone's schedule in stunts is chaotic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I eat a balanced meal every three to five hours. I have coffee in the morning, but instead of creamer I use either a chocolate or vanilla protein shake - it's still sweet but it has natural sugars and many other redeeming qualities. I usually have a protein bar with that, too. Every meal I make sure to have one to two servings of protein, and pack in as many vegetables as I can - lots of dark greens - and one to two servings of whole-grain carbs like brown rice or quinoa and sometimes fruit. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm super lazy when it comes to cooking; if it takes more than 15 minutes, I am out. I'll throw a frozen fish patty in a pan with avocado oil, and it cooks while I make a giant salad with blueberries, cranberries, plain Greek yogurt, chia seeds and walnuts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I also make big vegetable mixtures; I always have broccoli, frozen peas and frozen white corn. I keep protein bars in my car with packs of roasted seaweed [for] when I'm dashing from one thing to the next. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I definitely plan on doing [&quot;American Ninja Warrior&quot;] again; I will train with that intent. I'm trying to use the publicity I have right now to get more acting roles so that I can play my own superheroes. If I happen to get an action movie . . . and I'm in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while they're shooting, that would </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> competing on &quot;Ninja Warrior&quot; next year. </SPAN></P>
