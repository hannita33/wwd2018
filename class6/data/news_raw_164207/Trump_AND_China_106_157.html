<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tim Cook (pictured) is the apple of Goldman Sachs' eye. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Goldman is trying to persuade Apple to make a rival bid for Time Warner, a source with direct knowledge of the situation said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;They are freaking out trying to convince Apple to come in,&quot; the source told our Josh Kosman. Goldman has been left on the sidelines in advising on AT&amp;T's $85 billion agreement to acquire Time Warner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2009, Apple hired Goldman banker Adrian Perica to head its mergers practice, and now he has his staff looking for acquisition targets, the source said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Cook's company has expressed interest in buying Time Warner in the recent past, and there is some belief that judging from his comments this week, he will not let AT&amp;T carry the day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Apple's earnings call on Wednesday, he said, &quot;We are open to acquisitions of any size that are of strategic value, where we can deliver better products to our customers and innovate more. And so we look at a whole variety of companies, and based on that, we choose whether to move forward or not. But we're definitely open, and we definitely look.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;I would confirm that television has intense interest with me and many other people here. In terms of owning content and creating content.&quot; Goldman declined comment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Election parties </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Preparation is under way for election night viewing parties.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We hear that former Mayor Michael Bloomberg is hosting a little gathering at the Bloomberg Foundation for friends and family, while Snapchat, always big on the political party circuit, is also having a private event.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NBC star Seth Myers will be on hand to celebrate or commiserate with fellow comedians John Oliver and Sarah Silverman, who are part of the festivities put on by The National Resources Defense Council. Co-chairs of the Nov. 9 event include David and Pam Zaslav.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bloomberg reported that Hillary Clinton will be spending the evening at New York's Javits Center. Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is slated to be in New York that night, but the campaign hasn't said where.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Try the veal </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  GOP Pollster Frank Luntz took some shots at both presidential candidates at an advertising dinner hosted by the Digital Place Based Advertising Association boss Barry Frey on Wednesday night. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Luntz joked that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has immigrant wives because there are some jobs only an immigrant will do. Luntz, sporting limited edition colorful Adidas sneakers he bought in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> then joked that he has a bumper sticker that reads &quot;Run Hillary,&quot; which he stuck on the front of his car, not the back.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Anyone here voting for Gary Johnson?&quot; he asked a room full of big advertisers. When someone shouted, &quot;Yes,&quot; Luntz joked: &quot;Paper, pipe or bong?&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But his more serious message to the room was about bringing people together after Election Day. &quot;This country needs it so badly. Think of the people you are touching by your communication.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indians giver </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cleveland Indians owner Larry Dolan promoted baseball in his family long before buying the team in 2000, his son Mark told Josh Kosman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Larry coached his two sons, Mark and Indians CEO Paul, in little league. Paul, 57, is 1 &sup1;/  years older than Mark. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Paul threw a no-hitter in an all-star game and struck me out too,&quot; Mark said, when they were both in their early teens. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Who was Larry's favorite player? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The eccentric Joe Charboneau, 1980 AL Rookie of the Year who was best known for opening beer bottles with his eye socket. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As far as the World Series goes, the Indians will likely improve attendance by about 800,000 next season, a source close to the team said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This year, it was 28th in league attendance despite its success with 1.6 million fans, for an average of 19,650 a game. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Adding 800,000 gives the Indians a $15 million to $20 million boost in cash flow. Presently, it's about break-even. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not going to pot </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Could the growing push to legalize marijuana ruin the buzz for fast casual restaurants? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's per a research note by Buckingham Research analyst John Zolidis, according to our Lisa Fickenscher. While Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington have legalized recreational use of marijuana, and Arizona, Nevada, California, Maine and Massachusetts have ballot initiatives next week, Zolidis writes, pot isn't legal for use in eating establishments - although people often use it as a substitute for alcohol, which is a big money-maker for restaurants. At this point, the only eateries likely to benefit from more people having the munchies are pizza joints and other places with good delivery service. </SPAN></P>
