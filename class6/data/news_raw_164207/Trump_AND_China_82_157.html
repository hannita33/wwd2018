<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Abe LINCOLN'S legacy is safe, and not just because Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> talked too long Saturday. It's that he said too little that was new or uplifting.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Running out of time to change the campaign's dynamics, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> team picked Gettysburg for a speech it touted as a possible turning point in the presidential race, just as the 1863 battle there had turned the Civil War.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the candidate seemed to have other ideas about the proposition at hand. The result was a mash-up of conflicting themes instead of a clarion call to arms.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Part complaint, part appeal to better angels, part a contract with voters and part a list of things to do, the speech never gelled into a coherent vision. By trying to do too many things, it didn't do any well.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After starting with a perfunctory reference to Lincoln's address, and to his own status as a political outsider, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dedicated 10 precious minutes to a sour restatement of grievances against a &quot;rigged system.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The usual suspects - a dishonest media, voter fraud, Hillary Clinton's corruption, a crooked FBI and the &quot;liars&quot; who accused him of groping - were soundly thrashed. The women who lied will be sued, he promised, and giant media mergers would be broken up, too.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was a stale, dark opening that clouded the 20 minutes of solid policy promises that followed. As such, the reset needs a reset.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The problem is not just dwindling time, but also a shrinking pool of persuadable voters. National polls consistently show he is stuck at about 40 percent, and that many white, suburban women who usually vote Republican are not with him.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was talking directly to them, I missed it. As is often the case, he focused on feeding red meat to his core supporters instead of adding to them with a broader appeal.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That, presumably, was the goal of the substantive portion, but he was in no hurry to get there. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After his grievances, he switched gears by saying, &quot;Here is why this is relevant to you,&quot; meaning voters, citing jobs, health care and home ownership.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Look at what they've done to you,&quot; he said, repeating his attack on the &quot;rigging of the system.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At that point, he seemed to be going in a circle. But after vowing to &quot;drain the swamp of Washington,&quot; he finally hit on the theme his team had touted as the purpose. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He started with a new tone, asking voters to &quot;rise above the noise and clutter,&quot; embrace the &quot;faith and optimism that have always been the central ingredient&quot; of America and &quot;dream big again.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The words were right, and he read them properly off the teleprompter, but there wasn't much passion. It had echoes of a presidential address, but not the heart, and he too quickly moved to the programmatic &quot;contract&quot; he was committing to.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was a series of big things, some he would do on the first day, others in the first 100 days.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They included a hiring freeze, regulation curbs, tax cuts, a wall, congressional term limits, new trade deals, labeling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a currency manipulator, nominating a conservative judge to the Supreme Court and too many others to count or remember.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  None was new, but the point was the packaging to replicate the &quot;Contract with America&quot; that Newt Gingrich used to win the House in 1994.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That was a long time ago, when America was hungry for change from President Bill Clinton's first two years and his decision to let Hillary Clinton remake health care. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, advised by Gingrich in another election about change, is trying to follow a similar path to keep Hillary from getting back to the White House.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The choice of Gettysburg underscores the lessons of history, but one of them is that Lincoln's magnificent address initially was panned as inadequate. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't have the luxury of time, so he must hope that what he said there was not in vain. </SPAN></P>
