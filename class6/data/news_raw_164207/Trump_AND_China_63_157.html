<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the talk at  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thanksgiving dinner at his Florida club was all about if he should pick  Mitt Romney or Rudy Giuliani for secretary of state.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president-elect held court on Thursday at his Palm Beach, Fla., Mar-a-Lago club at a large table with family members including wife Melania and sons Eric and Barron.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One witness told us </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took a prime table next to the fireplace in the club's living room, but spent a lot of time greeting members and asking who they think should be his top diplomat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The spy said, &quot;Donald was walking around asking everybody he could about who should be his secretary of state. There was a lot of criticism about Romney, and a lot of people like Rudy. There are also many people advocating for [former US ambassador to the UN] John Bolton.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Friday it was reported that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants Romney to publicly apologize for criticizing him during the campaign in order to be considered for secretary of state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Guests joining </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago included Christopher Nixon Cox, the grandson of Richard Nixon, who we are told is being lined up to be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also there was Marvel Entertainment CEO Ike Perlmutter, CEO of Newsmax Media Christopher Ruddy, boxing promoter Don King, interior designer William Eubanks and political consultant Mary Ourisman. Attracting almost as much attention as the president-elect was chiseled romance-novel hunk Fabio, who was seated at a table near </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and &quot;was asked for pictures nearly as often as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> himself.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, security was intense. The witness told us that Ocean Boulevard outside Mar-a-Lago was sealed off, and all vehicles were diverted to a nearby parking lot to be fully searched and checked by sniffer dogs. Entering the club, all members had to pass through airport-style metal detectors and have their bags searched. Once inside, &quot;Secret Service agents were swarming everywhere. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seemed relaxed, like he was in his own living room and surrounded by family.&quot; </SPAN></P>
