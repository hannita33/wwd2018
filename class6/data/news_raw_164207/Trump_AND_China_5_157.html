<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here's the scenario: Washington suddenly makes an unusual move in Asia that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't like. Beijing's public response is measured, but it works behind the scenes to undermine US-led diplomacy. After a few months, Beijing cools off and resumes its cooperation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A possible future historical account of last week's much-publicized phone call between Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen and President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Nope. It's a story that already took place this year. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In July, reacting to North Korea's nuclear and missile tests, Washington and Seoul announced their intention to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (anti-missile) system on South Korean soil. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> response was swift. After some nuanced foreign ministry statements, came the real reaction - and in an arena the Obama administration considers its forte: multilateral diplomacy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a senior UN diplomat described it, his Chinese colleagues have been warming up to the idea of toughening Security Council sanctions on North Korea. After bouncing ideas around with their American counterparts, they suddenly clammed up. Any attempt to work on a sanctions resolution was met with cold silence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The deployment of THAAD changed the equation for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; the diplomat explained. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet last week, bingo: The UN Security Council unanimously - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> included - agreed on what victorious US diplomats described as &quot;the toughest sanctions resolution in history.&quot; (OK, they always say that - but still . . . ) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why the Chinese zigzag? One reason Beijing props up the North Korean regime is fear: If Kim Jong Un's oppressive regime collapses and the peninsula unites under Seoul's rule, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be surrounded by strong pro-American democracies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  True, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan don't undermine </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> authoritarian regime by their mere existence. But, in Beijing's view, they may one day threaten </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> militarily. American THAADs near </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> borders, though defensive, are a scary step in that direction. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Which explains why its diplomats refused, for months after the THAAD announcement, to even contemplate a UN sanctions resolution against North Korea.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the other hand, Pyongyang's crazed antics are beyond the pale even for Beijing's leaders, as anti-American as they may be. They're increasingly realizing that the kooks of the North are totally out of control. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN hands returned to the negotiation table and, together with American diplomats, forged a sanctions resolution meant to put the fear of god in godless Kim. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The resolution, which passed last week, would threaten the North's meager legitimate sources of foreign currency, mainly coal exports to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Adept Chinese diplomats made sure nothing in the resolution would actually jeopardize Kim's hold on power.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beijing will decide if and how much it'll actually enforce the restrictions. To date, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> enforcement of sanctions has been sketchy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So, no, a UN punishment that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> helped write won't likely end the North's nuclear and missile programs. In fact, instead of selling coal to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Kim may amp up sales of missiles and nuke components to wealthy unsavory actors. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet, clearly something needs to be done about Pyongyang's recklessness. As President Obama reportedly intimated in his White House post-election meeting with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, North Korea emerges as the biggest threat on the new president's national-security horizon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  America should certainly cooperate with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and push it to lean on its next-door ally. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pick of Beijing-friendly Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad for ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can help there. (Branstad can also help manage tricky trade issues.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But we also must make clear to Chinese strongman Xi Jinping that there will be consequences for propping up a murderous regime that threatens the region and the world. After all, Kim is now developing the means to attack us - on our own soil. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In short order, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would do well to announce that the only good outcome is a unified, democratic Korea. Unification won't happen tomorrow morning, but declaring that goal publicly may prompt </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (after some initial fit-throwing) to rethink some of its policies toward Pyongyang. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  America must help Beijing's pragmatic leaders recognize that disarming the North's madman - and eventually getting rid of him - is in their interest, not just ours. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For that matter, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> violating some unofficial protocol by publicly acknowledging a call from Taiwan's democratically elected leader - who's been a thorn in Beijing's side - is a good first step.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It signals that America will no longer kowtow to Beijing's whims. Instead, we'll look out for our own interests, which also happen to be those of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> neighbors, and even </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> itself. </SPAN></P>
