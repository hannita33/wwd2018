<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a breakthrough for the Durst Organization that's also welcome news for the Port Authority and the city, financial securities firm ICAP has leased 82,442 square feet at 4 Times Square, with an expansion option of up to an additional 41,221 square feet. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's the first deal in what's expected to be a gradual, but inevitable, lease-up of Cond&eacute; Nast's former space in the 1.8-million-square-foot tower at West 42nd Street. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's also a boost for Midtown, which has recently seen an exodus of some high-profile tenants to downtown, the far West Side and Midtown South. ICAP will be leaving some of its current space at Harborside Plaza in Jersey City. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The ICAP lease follows a $100 million capital-improvements program at 4 Times Square, which was state-of-the-art when Douglas Durst opened it in 2000, but needed contemporizing to compete with newer product. The upgrades include new entrances, lobby and elevator cabs - plus &quot;preservation and enhancement&quot; of Cond&eacute; Nast's famous cafeteria designed by Frank Gehry, which will be the &quot;cornerstone of a shared amenity and conference center space.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The PA is reimbursing Durst for Cond&eacute; Nast's rent on the rest of its 4 Times Square lease through 2019, as an inducement for the publisher's move to One World Trade Center, where Durst is a 10-percent partner. The PA has been paying Durst $3 million a month for Cond&eacute;'s former space. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cond&eacute; left behind 817,000 square feet on floors 4-24. The asking rent on ICAP's new space was around $85 per square foot, sources said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  n  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More Midtown good news: Dentons, the world's largest law firm, has extended its 210,000-square-foot lease at Rockefeller Group's 1221 Sixth Ave. The firm has been there since 1992. It's now extended its current lease for floors 23-26 through April 2025. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's the third deal at 1221 Sixth since Rockefeller completed a capital-improvement program including new entrances, side-street plazas, a new street-level facade and interior stone work. The 2.5- million-square-footer is 93 percent leased. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Terms were not released. Sources said the asking rent was in the high $70s. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  n  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new, family-friendly Times Square has been called &quot;Disneyfied,&quot; wholesome, vibrant, and tourist-trampled - but not sophisticated or chic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That might change in 2017 with the opening of the Edition by Marriott Times Square at the congested corner of Seventh Avenue and West 47th Street. It will be Manhattan's second &quot;luxury lifestyle&quot; Edition property, following the one at Madison Square Park. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The 39-story hotel with cutting-edge interiors designed by Ian Schrager and Yabu Pushelberg has 5-star aspirations, according to developer Steven Witkoff. It will be aimed at a more trendy clientele than at other inns along the &quot;Bowtie.&quot; (His partners are Winthrop Realty Trust, Howard Lorber's New Valley and Mark Siffin's Maefield Development. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While guest rooms will be high-end, the tower's lower floors are likely to draw the spectacle-seeking hordes. Leases have been signed with two mass-market tenants, it has been reported. The NFL and Cirque du Soleil are jointly creating a 40,000-square-foot interactive exhibition and entertainment venue on the third and fourth levels. Hershey's will move into a ground-floor space three times larger than its current 2,000 square feet across the street.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But, we asked Witkoff: Why was it seeming to take so long? Although the project was first announced in 2012, a steel framework began to take form only recently. &quot;As we began excavating for the foundation, we found that old footings were attached to nothing,&quot; he explained. &quot;They were literally floating free.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;We knew we had to shore it up, but before we could pull [Buildings Department] permits, we had to go back to the MTA&quot; - necessary because the N, R and Q lines run directly beneath, Witkoff said. The process added &quot;eight or nine months.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I was surprised to receive a shout-out from Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in his speech in Detroit on Monday. But the Feb. 7 column from which he quoted was a celebration of his early real estate accomplishments in New York - not a presidential endorsement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While I believe </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> projects in the 1970s-1990s are underappreciated, I also lamented his later &quot;cartoonish TV personality, &quot;selling his name to just about any developer willing to sign a check,&quot; &quot;like the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soho Hotel, which he neither built nor owns&quot; and &quot;tacky promotion of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-made shirts and ties among other goofy ventures.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I also wrote that he &quot;was a better developer than a dealmaker.&quot; But I stand by my claims for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> role in helping to rescue the crumbling city. </SPAN></P>
