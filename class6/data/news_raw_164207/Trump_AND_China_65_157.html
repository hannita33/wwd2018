</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All the noise about Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;hostile takeover&quot; of the Republican Party misses a key point: Such takeovers only succeed when existing management has failed massively. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And that's true of both the GOP and the conservative movement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a disrupter - but most of the fire aimed his way is just shooting the messenger.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Start with this: A few weeks ago, when Washington Post and New York Times reporters sought the Republican establishment's reaction to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the folks they dug up to talk to were a bunch of consultants and lobbyists. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That is, mercenaries - guys who get paid, win or lose. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They're not (all) without principle, but they have a huge vested interest in the conventional fields and styles of combat that they've mastered - which earn them very, very good livings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Really, they're no different from the lefty lobbyists now cashing in from their access to Mayor de Blasio. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And the Times-Post crowd wasn't wrong: They're the closest thing the GOP has to &quot;wise men.&quot; There are no sage party elders to go to.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I asked Ed Cox, the New York GOP chief, about this not long ago. His reply: &quot;If you find the Republican establishment, let me know - I can't find them anywhere.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cox is President Richard Nixon's son-in-law; he's been around Republican politics for five decades. If he says there's no there there, there isn't. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beyond the mercenaries, you've got a variety of pundits and talk-radio jocks - folks whose job is to entertain a (large) niche audience. They're focused on their niches - and inevitably view the general interest of the GOP, as well as the nation, through those blinders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Much of the punditry's now pointing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-blame fingers at the GOP &quot;donor class&quot; for leading the party astray - bribing pols to embrace open borders, avoid social issues, etc., etc. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's a fair point: You know all you need to about the donors' political judgment by noting that they dumped $150 million on Jeb Bush - when Jeb would've been a low-energy loser by now even if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was still off doing &quot;The Apprentice.&quot; (The donors' other early fave, Scott Walker, dropped out even earlier, also for cause.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the money-men stumbled into this leading role because, ever since the Reagan years, the GOP regulars and the conservatives have been aiming for the Gipper's second coming merely by imposing ever-stricter ideological tests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That has produced a stream of candidates competing over who can best mouth the catechism, plus somehow pick up enough other votes to take the White House.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Today, the main alternatives to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio - each a specialist in pushing one or another set of right-wing buttons.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Which leaves them stiff.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz's best real moment so far came when he talked about trying to get his sister out of that crack house - everything else is a rehearsed performance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Until last week, Rubio was just a smoother, more &quot;uplifting&quot; Cruz. Marco's far more loose, authentic and appealing now that he's trading low blows with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - he's a real person, rather than some bizarre savant finding the right mini-speech in his memory. Maybe the change has come in time . . . </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anyway, both offer pretty much the same &quot;unify the party and add a few more voters somewhere&quot; strategy for the general election that's been failing for the GOP since 1998. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The one time it (barely) worked, we got Dubya. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The big early achievements of the Bush presidency were, at best, technocratic, not conservative: No Child Left Behind, the new Medicare prescription-drug entitlement and some temporary tax cuts.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then came 9/11 - and soon the best and the brightest of the Republican Party gave us the Iraq debacle (much as the Democrats' best and brightest had given us Vietnam a generation before). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After that, conventional GOP thinking gave us John McCain and Mitt Romney nominations - neither a winner, nor even that good a competitor. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Romney actually tried to win by reaching out to the very same voters that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> now locked up, and by using the same issues: In 2012, Mitt was a hawk on immigration and on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade - he just couldn't make the voters believe it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I can't say whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will get my vote when the primaries come to our neck of the woods, but I don't resent his existence or his success, nor blame him for destroying the GOP. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Republicans pulled that one off all by themselves. </SPAN></P>
