<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> beats Hillary Clinton, it'll be because he speaks directly to the voters - without the poll-driven, focus-grouped blandifying filter Hillary never leaves home without. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The contrast was there again Wednesday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l  He delivered a thumping speech full of applause lines that spoke directly to what regular Americans see as the nation's problems.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lines like: &quot;We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And: &quot;We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed. This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Above all, he noted that her campaign slogan is &quot;I'm with her&quot; - and gave his response: &quot;I'm with you: the American people.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  l  The same day, Clinton gave her own big speech - where, when her TelePrompTer said &quot;(sigh),&quot; she actually said the word rather than make the noise. Scripted much, Hillary? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And her content was just the same old tired list of Democratic talking points: She wants to hike taxes on Wall Street, big corporations and the super-rich, and keep raising the minimum wage.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OK, those ideas don't poll badly - but this was her big speech on the economy. How is any of it going to create jobs?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whereas </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> early on talked up &quot;jobs, jobs, jobs&quot; - with specifics on where they're coming from, from broad tax cuts to unleashing the US energy industry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And, yes, cutting better trade deals - something that Clinton joins the NeverTrumpers in painting as an unthinkable nightmare. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sorry, does nobody recall how President Bill Clinton renegotiated a major trade treaty?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bubba took office in 1993 with NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, already a done deal. But Democratic special interests - unions, the green lobby - didn't like it, so he made more concessions to Mexico and Canada in order get major &quot;labor and environmental side accords&quot; added on. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can similarly open up Obama's Trans-Pacific trade deal - this time dumping items that Obama inserted to please his favored special interests in order to get a deal that's better for American workers and businesses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There's no reason </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can't (eventually) do the same on NAFTA and other standing deals. And none of it risks a trade war. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How much good it'll do, I can't say - I put more faith in the rest of his pro-growth program, particularly the energy policies.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But tens of millions of voters see trade as a huge issue, one where the establishment has ignored their perfectly valid concerns for a generation - when it hasn't smugly dismissed them as ignorant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yes, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can get harsh when he's talking trade (and other issues). But how else does he show he means it?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mitt Romney made tough noises on trade with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (and on immigration, too). Nobody believed him, because he was so plainly a guy who would wilt under establishment pressure. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fine, I wince at some point whenever I watch </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But I've been wincing at every Republican nominee since Reagan; every one of them still got my vote.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And if you look at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> actual program, he's not even close to being off the GOP reservation - he's just opened the door to Americans who've quite rightly been feeling left out. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, is horrible. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was utterly on point in saying she's &quot;spent her entire life making money for special interests - and taking money from special interests.&quot; How else do you get stinking rich after 2&frac12; decades in public service? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At heart, she may not be as radical as President Obama or Bernie Sanders - but what difference, at this point, does it make? She's also in hock to every special interest in the Democratic Party - she's fully embraced Obama's entire domestic agenda, and if she wins she'll get to remake the Supreme Court so she can impose it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had it right again: &quot;My message is that things have to change - and this is our one chance to do it. This is our last chance to do it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
