<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear John: I'm trying to help my daughter get a mortgage. She's in the midst of a messy divorce. Her soon-to-be ex hasn't worked (or looked for a job for that matter) in two years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She's a very hard worker. Makes good money and is a great mother. She had maintained great credit and is a highly regarded employee with great potential. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the midst of the divorce, their mortgage payment fell behind 120 days. This happened only one time. That's what's killing her. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All payments have been current for six months. She's found a house and wants to bid but needs a mortgage pre-approval, which she can't get. She's trying to start a new life for her kids and herself. She will have 20 percent to put down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm happy to stand behind her. Any suggestions? It's killing me to see her this way. J.G. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear J.G. I'm happy to say that we seem to have found your daughter a mortgage. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And by &quot;we&quot; I mean Billy Procida, a financier and head of Procida Funding &amp; Advisors, which is based in Englewood Cliffs, NJ. Procida is a New York City guy whom I met a few months ago when his rock band was playing at the Highline Ballroom. How's that for luck? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His company does business in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York. Your needs were well below what Procida usually finances but, as a favor to me, he put you in touch with some mortgage companies. And you recently told me you have a couple to choose from and that the only delay at this point is on your end.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Glad the house purchase seems to be working out, even if the marriage didn't. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear John: F**k you, a**hole. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You are a lying right wing loon that spews lies to get readers!!! F.U. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear F.U. Sir, punctuation and sentence structure are so important in a letter like this since you - obviously - want to be thought of as a thoughtful, level-headed guy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So please be more careful next time. But I do like the multiple exclamation points at the end to show passion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trouble is, I don't know if you are replying to my analysis of the employment numbers or my column about how the National Security Agency has copies of what are likely to be e-mails that are very embarrassing to Hillary Clinton.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For us to have an educated, grown-up conversation, like I'm sure you are seeking, I obviously need to know what bug is up your a**.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  LET'S DO OUR 'REPATRIOTIC' DUTY, US </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear John: I loved your idea two years ago on this topic of allowing US companies to repatriate profits at a lower tax rate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm glad </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is bringing it up now (although it gets buried by his stupid statement of the day shtick). You should also note to your readers that this could be repeated going forward, as US companies are making money overseas every day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  My business is actually looking seriously at bringing production back from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to simplify our supply chain. I'm sure a lot of US manufacturers would give this a closer look if, in addition to this repatriation tax break, we lowered corporate tax rates or provided tax credits to companies that were &quot;onshoring.&quot; J.S. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dear J.S.. Yes, bring those jobs back!  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pal Carl Icahn also backs the repatriation idea. So if this guy actually gets elected, you might get your wish.  </SPAN></P>
