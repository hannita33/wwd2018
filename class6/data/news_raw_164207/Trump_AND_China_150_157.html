<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's high noon in Dallas and there's fixin' to be a shootout. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Except those aren't six-shooters in them thar holsters, but spray-paint cans and fan brushes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I know what you're thinking: Isn't this supposed to be the city of big hats, rodeos, the solar system's sexiest pom-pommers and JFK's final carpool? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yes, now and forever, but Big D is likewise home to other varmints you might not be expecting: art geeks. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Loads of 'em. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even Austin is like, &quot;Hey Dallas, get a job, hippie!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ah, but being an art fiend around town is more lucrative than it may seem, from the art walks along the mean streets of its Deep Ellum 'hood, to curating the gallotel  er, hotellery  or whatever it is you'd like to call the hybrid museum/inn that is the iconic Hilton Anatole. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And this being Texas, the rivalry between artscapes is no less intense than that of, say, nearby TCU and Baylor's. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here, a peek inside Dallas' right-brained rodeo - git art done! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  DEEP ELLUM </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Murals of Krang from &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.&quot; Number 5 of &quot;Short Circuit&quot; fame. The Icee polar bear. If you didn't know any better, the graffiti artists around east Dallas' Deep Ellum neighborhood were totally NWA - nerds with artistry. Hell, they wear that title proudly, according to local celebrity tagger, Pabst Artcan Tall Boy 2015 winner and body artist Jerod &quot;DTOX&quot; Davis, who leads tours ($40/pp) of the former warehouse district that's couched between I-45 and Exposition Avenue. Nearly every wall of every building here doubles as a giant graffiti canvas. Even Mark Cuban, notoriously protective of his Mavericks brand, signed off on a mural of a celebratory Dirk Nowitzki after the Mavs beat the Heat in the 2011 NBA finals. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Historically serving as an enclave for Dallas' black and European immigrant communities, Deep Ellum was a hot bed of jazz and blues clubs and domino parlors going back to the early 1900s (the current name of the hood itself is local slang for the original moniker, &quot;Deep Elm&quot;) - Texas' kinda-sorta version of New Orleans, hold the Gallic flair. It was also where Henry Ford set up a Model T assembly plant in 1914. The area started to fall into disrepair after World War II, and it was nearly destroyed by crime by the end of the century. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the city began revitalizing Deep Ellum in the 2000s; today you'll find all sorts of new clubs, jewelry stores, galleries, restaurants - all of which smartly commission local street artists to tag their walls (it's going to happen anyway). The aforementioned Krang, e.g. - a mutant, supervillain brain who pilots an android body from its stomach, on the off chance you didn't know - enjoys a wing and a beer on siding at Deep Ellum's BrainDead Brewing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BTW: If you stumble on any Montana Cans-wielding writers working on a piece-in-progress, they're more than happy to chat you up. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  HILTON ANATOLE </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Talk about a night at the museum. You'll come to this Downtown landmark for the stylish suites, V Spa and S R steakhouse atop the roof   but you'll stay for the exhibits. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Long before the burgeoning Design District that surrounds it got into the gallery game, the 1,606-room hotel's father and East Asian art-o-holic, developer Trammell Crow was busy culling his own collection. Today it has more than 1,000 pieces, making it one of the largest art-n-antique collections ever amassed by an American hotel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They're not hard to miss, from the 12-foot panels of the Berlin Wall painted by Jurgen Grosse, to a room filled with gobs and gobs of English Wedgewood Porcelain from the 1850s, to the hand-painted gold-and-enamel plates dating back to 17th-century </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Eccentric sculptures permeate the 45-acre grounds: lazing Buddhas, boxing rabbits, a &quot;Riding into the Sunset&quot; Will Rogers on horseback. Life-sized-ish, Thai-crafted elephants that were placed in the lobby to greet partygoers of the 1984 Republican National Convention remain today (I smell a &quot;Trunks for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; promotion just waiting to happen). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Take a guided art tour of it all, or DIY with the help of a the hotel's free Anatole Art app for iPhone or Android. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Oh, and the Anatole's unveiling a whole new pool/swim-up bar/lazy river/luxe cabana'd complex called Jade Waters this summer, so even if you hate art, there's that (rooms from $209). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  DALLAS ARTS DISTRICT </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not sure if you've noticed, but Texans are concerned with size. Quite concerned. Fittingly, Dallas has the largest arts district in the entire country. Spanning some 68 acres and 19 connected blocks, the three-decade-old DAD is a village of museums, performance spaces, restaurants, churches, a school, offices and coveted residences. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The headliner is the 370,000-square-foot Dallas Museum of Art, which sports 23,000 works from over 5,000 years of human imagining and tinkering. Temporary exhibits to look out for: &quot;Jackson Pollock: Blind Spots,&quot; currently on display until March 20; and in April, &quot;Saints and Monsters: Prints by Albrecht D&uuml;rer,&quot; devoted to the terrifyingly cool, supernatural works of the German Renaissance printmaker. But the best time to visit is when the sun goes down on the third Friday of each month when the DMA hosts &quot;Late Nights,&quot; featuring concerts, film screenings and readings till midnight (general admission is free; special exhibit tix are $16). </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Or, right across the way, make like the city's many yoga rats, food truck fanatics, ping-pong paddlers, outdoor movie screeners and concert goers and mosey on over to Klyde Warren Park. Serving as the district's central gathering space - nay, the entire city's, as it connects the DAD to both Uptown and Downtown - the 5.2-acre decked park hosted the inaugural Park &amp; Palate food-and-wine fundraiser (tastings, cooking demos, live music, chef judging, booze, etc.) last September. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Expect another go-round of the comfort food-a-palooza this year. Cheers, y'all. </SPAN></P>
