<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> willingness to return a US Navy underwater drone it seized in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea &quot;should not be the end of the saga,&quot; writes Gordon Chang in The Daily Beast. &quot;Washington must impose costs on Beijing for what constituted an act of piracy - and an act of war.&quot; In fact, he says, the seizure &quot;is only the latest act in a course of belligerent conduct spanning this century&quot; by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against the US. Yet President Obama &quot;cannot even talk about Chinese aggression.&quot; So &quot;Beijing now thinks it can, with impunity, do whatever it wants wherever it wants.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Conservative take: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cabinet Must Fight Agencies </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Much is being made of the fact that many of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cabinet picks &quot;have key philosophical differences with the missions of the agencies they have been tapped to run,&quot; notes David French at National Review, the fear being that &quot;they don't want to lead their agencies so much as [to] 'dismantle' them.&quot; Says French: &quot;Many on the left think this is a terrible thing. I think it's fabulous.&quot; That's because the critics &quot;are wrongly equating the agency's very mission with the progressive policies they favor.&quot; But &quot;the Obama administration didn't have the popular support to pass its agenda through Congress, so it went around Congress on a massive scale, including through executive actions and regulatory rulemakings.&quot; Now that's all &quot;subject to repeal.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the right: Obama's Hypocrisy on Intel Briefings </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Marc Thiessen in The Washington Post takes Obama to task for his &quot;chutzpah&quot; in criticizing his successor for skipping his daily intelligence briefings: &quot;This coming from the same person who skipped more than half of his daily intelligence briefings in his first term.&quot; Indeed, &quot;not only did Obama commit the same malpractice,&quot; he &quot;used the same excuses as Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to justify it&quot;: that he was regularly briefed by his national-security team. Asks Thiessen: &quot;So Obama could rely on other national security briefings, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cannot?&quot; As for ridicule of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for saying he's &quot;a smart person,&quot; Obama's NSC spokesman said his boss didn't need briefings because he's &quot;among the most sophisticated consumers of intelligence on the planet.&quot; As it happens, says Thiessen, they're both wrong: &quot;They do need briefers.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Professor: I Was Punished for Singing Beach Boys Tune </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Buck Ryan of the University of Kentucky's First Amendment Center writes in the Lexington Herald Leader that he recently was disciplined for &quot;sexual misconduct.&quot; His crime? &quot;Singing a Beach Boys tune covered by Alvin and the Chipmunks.&quot; The tune was the classic &quot;California Girls,&quot; which the university's Title IX coordinator ruled &quot;included 'language of a sexual nature' and was somehow offensive.&quot; Ryan sang the song for students at a Chinese university, using local places instead of the original American ones. &quot;UK's three-month investigation of my case revealed no student complaints,&quot; but his punishment &quot;bans me from receiving international travel funds and strips me of a prestigious award worth thousands of dollars.&quot; And &quot;when I inquired about my due process rights, I was told by the provost that I didn't have any.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Business writer: Who Checks the Fact-Checkers? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Leonid Bershidsky at Bloomberg is unimpressed with Facebook's announced plan for combatting &quot;fake news.&quot; The site will &quot;effectively outsource the fact-checking of news stories flagged by users as possibly fake to third-party groups&quot; that sign &quot;a code developed at the Poynter Institute.&quot; But that undermines Facebook's &quot;own impartiality and may open the way for censorship on social networks.&quot; For one thing, &quot;Facebook's choice of partner immediately cuts off a large swath of conservative readers. Poynter's International Fact-Checking Network, home to the code of principles, is funded, among other donors, by George Soros's Open Society Foundations,&quot; raising the issue of &quot;partisan bias.&quot; And many of the groups &quot;sometimes disagree about the veracity of the same statement&quot; - because &quot;truth is sometimes complicated and multilayered.&quot; - Compiled by Eric Fettmann </SPAN></P>
