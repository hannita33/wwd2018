<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Chinese warship seized an underwater drone deployed by an American oceanographic vessel in international waters in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, triggering a US protest and demand for its return, officials said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The incident took place Thursday northwest of Subic Bay off the Philippines as the US Navy ship USNS Bowditch - which has a civilian crew - was about to retrieve the &shy;unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), Reuters reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The drone was part of an unclassified program to collect oceanographic data, including salinity, temperature and other scientific facts used for sonar operations, a US official said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The UUV was lawfully conducting a military survey in the waters of the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea,&quot; the official said. &quot;It's a sovereign immune vessel, clearly marked in English not to be removed from the water - that it was US property.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said the United States &shy;issued a formal complaint but he was unaware of any &shy;response. He said this may be the first time in recent history that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has taken a US naval vessel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Bowditch had already retrieved another drone and was 500 yards from the seized device when a Chinese Dalang &shy;III-class vessel grabbed it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The Chinese ship acknowledged a radio call from the Bowditch but did not respond to US demands, according to Davis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The only thing they said after they were sailing off into the distance was, 'We are returning to normal operations,' &quot; he said. No shots were fired, he added. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pentagon said the 10-foot-long drone used commercially available technology and sold for about $150,000, but it stressed that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had seized US military property. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the seizure occurred in the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines, not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and &shy;appeared to be a violation of international law.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Chinese action heightened US concerns about the country's tactics in the disputed sea - including its militarization of maritime outposts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An American think tank reported this week that new satellite images showed that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has installed weapons - including anti-aircraft and anti- missile systems - on all seven artificial islands it has built in the sea, Reuters reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The incident comes after President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has questioned the United States' &quot;One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; foreign policy, in which formal relations are kept with Beijing and not Taiwan.
