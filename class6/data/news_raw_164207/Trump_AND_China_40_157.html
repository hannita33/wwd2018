</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Are President Obama, Hillary Clinton and violent leftists in cahoots to elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Or are they just idiots? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The evidence is overwhelming that they all belong to a conspiracy - either of secret GOP sympathizers or of dunces. Those are the only options after Democrats took turns denouncing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in ways that actually bolstered the potency of his arguments. Three examples tell the tale. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  First, Obama traveled to Indiana to deliver what aides called his first attempt to influence the election. That's a lie, of course, but not the biggest one of the day. No. 1 would be Obama's touting the economy as a roaring success. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;If what you care about in this election is your pocketbook; if what you're concerned about is who will look out for the interests of working people and grow the middle class,&quot; the president claimed, &quot;if what you're concerned about is the economy, then the debate is not even close.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He crowed about &quot;progress&quot; made during his tenure, and said sticking with Democrats was the only sensible option.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two days later, the Labor Department reported that employers added a mere 38,000 jobs in May, the worst report in six years. Even with massive help from the Federal Reserve, the economy's slow growth means it has created three million fewer jobs than it should have by now, making Obama's boast look ridiculous. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It also makes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> focus on creating jobs and criticism of &shy;international trade deals look like the right ideas. After all, if puny growth for seven years is the best Obama can do, why not give the other team and other ideas a chance? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton provided the second backfire example with her &shy;foreign-policy speech. It had very little to do with actual foreign policy, and everything to do with a rehearsed rant on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. She called him reckless, childish, uninformed and unprepared. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes,&quot; she declared. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The liberal press ate it up, displaying a remarkable talent for ignoring the foreign-policy &shy;disasters unfolding around the world, courtesy of Clinton and Obama. The next president will inherit the brutal aggressions of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Russia and the cancerous spread of Islamic terrorism.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And it takes a special media willfulness to refuse to see the biblical deprivations befalling millions of refugees spilling out from Syria and Libya after Obama and Clinton helped turn those countries' crises into &shy;catastrophes. In a recent span of just eight days, about 1,000 people drowned trying to escape across the Mediterranean to &shy;Europe. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If that's the best Dems can do, why should they get a third term? Would </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> be worse?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The third evidence of a conspiracy involved a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally in San Jose, Calif. Or rather, it &shy;involved the thugs, gang members and people burning the American flag and waving Mexican flags who attacked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An ABC reporter tweeted that police lost control and that &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters [were] being terrorized and beaten up by mobs of protesters.&quot; Among those beaten was a man named Juan Hernandez, a gay Latino </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporter who released photos of his broken nose and bloody shirt, along with a statement, writing:  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Got jumped last night as we exited the rally . . . Thanks for a broken nose, uncontrollable bleeding, and a bash to the head, Democrats. You sure are doing your party proud.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Hernandez notes, the violence helps make </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case. If the candidate's promise to control the border brings such a ferocious backlash, he's on to something.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That scary thought must have seeped into the central brain of The New York Times, which gave a disgracefully distorted picture of what happened in San Jose. It called the one-way &shy;assaults &quot;clashes&quot; between &quot;protesters&quot; and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> backers, as if both sides were equally to blame.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even more shameful, the paper's Friday article included this sentence: &quot;While Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he does not condone violence of any kind, his campaign made little effort to condemn it.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You can't be that ignorant without intent.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The pattern is obvious - the Democrats' Way is in trouble. The economy won't cooperate with their big-government nostrums, Clinton is dodging Bernie Sanders and the FBI, and Obama doesn't understand why the world doesn't treat his every &shy;utterance as gospel. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Maybe they should take a hint. Maybe, finally, America has had enough.  </SPAN></P>
