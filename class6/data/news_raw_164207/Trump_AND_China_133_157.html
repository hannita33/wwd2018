<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Israel is &quot;temporarily reducing&quot; ties with 10 countries that voted for the UN Security Council resolution demanding a halt to settlement building in the Palestinian territories, the nation's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon refuted reports that Israel was suspending ties with the countries, but said his nation was &quot;temporarily reducing&quot; visits and work with embassies, Agence France-Presse reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The countries targeted by Israel are Britain, France, Russia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japan, Ukraine, Angola, Egypt, Uruguay and Spain. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Until further notice, we'll limit our contacts with the embassies here in Israel and refrain from visits of Israeli officials to those states, and of visits of officials from those states here,&quot; Nahshon told AFP. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The diplomatic discord is the result of Friday's vote, in which 14 of 15 Security Council members demanded &quot;Israel immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Emboldened Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Tuesday that he hoped a Mideast conference in France on Jan. 15 would set a timetable for independence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;The decision [at the UN] lays the foundation for any future serious negotiation . . . and it paves the way for the international peace conference slated to be held in Paris next month,&quot; Abbas said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   &quot;The [resolution] proves that the world rejects the settlements, as they are illegal.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly called on Abbas to meet for direct talks without preconditions.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite the resolution, Israel is moving ahead with plans for thousands of new homes in East Jerusalem, where Palestinians want to establish their capital. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Palestinians claim the West Bank and East Jerusalem - home to Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites- as parts of their future state. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The US abstained from the vote, declining to use its veto power and enraging Netanyahu. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Israel's nationalist government is banking on support from the incoming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration to undo the damage - claiming again Tuesday it had received &quot;ironclad&quot; information from Arab sources that the Obama White House helped craft the resolution.
