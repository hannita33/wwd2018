<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For those not attending the inauguration, Activate consultant Michael J. Wolf threw a final-night dinner in Davos, Switzerland, for 80 at the famed Post Hotel.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After a week of panels about how wealth is distributed around the globe, guests were lured with the promise that there wouldn't be any speeches.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Matt Damon and Willi.i.am, were slated to eat traditional Swiss food alongside global circuit-goers Eric Schmidt, Martin Sorrell and Arianna Huffington.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yahoo's Marissa Mayer and satellite TV entrepreneur Charlie Ergen were invited, along with journalists WSJ Editor-In-Chief Gerard Baker, Yahoo Finance boss Andy Serwer and Fortune's Alan Murray.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Our tipsters say Topic A at Davos this year was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stunning new role as a global champion of free trade, and the business community's renewed sense of optimism.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;There was talk about AT&amp;T and Time Warner, Facebook's role in the election, European Union regulations on technology companies and who President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will pick to run the FTC,&quot; said our insider in the Swiss mountains.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dolan's air band </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  James Dolan is a big fan of the sharing economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   According to SEC documents filed last week, MSG will loan its executive chairman its Gulfstream G550. In return, Dolan will lease his older G450 back to the company. Dolan does, after all, hopscotch the country, playing gigs with his band.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An MSG spokesman explained: &quot;There are two jets, and when Jim's plane is taking the Knicks boss Phil Jackson somewhere and he needs it, then there are two. It makes sense.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Save the date </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Is Yahoo/Verizon a done deal?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Deal-watchers could find out this week. Verizon has been hemming and hawing about whether it will follow through on its $4.83 billion deal to acquire the portal after Yahoo got hit with news of two hacks.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The two companies' earnings calendars might provide a clue. Yahoo reports its fourth-quarter report on Jan. 23, after the bell. Then Verizon reports its latest numbers on the morning of Jan. 24.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Coincidence? If the two had news, it might be a good idea to sync it before the markets open.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last year, Yahoo's earnings were released Feb. 2, and Verizon's were out on Jan. 21. Our Street sources believe the dates portend something good, and suggest the two parties have been spending a lot of time negotiating the extent to which Yahoo retains legal liabilities.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No male room </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fashion and beauty p.r. queen Alison Brod (pictured) has nothing against men - at all.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She just doesn't usually employ them. It's been a year since Alison Brod Marketing &amp; Communications, a boutique firm in Murray Hill, had a man on staff. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Any man can apply,&quot; Brod told our Lisa Fickenscher. &quot;But most of the r&eacute;sum&eacute;s we get are from women.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That might have something to do with the clients she attracts and the employee perks she provides at her firm.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among her clients are nail polish company OPI, Drew Barrymore's Flower Beauty makeup line and Ralph Lauren Fragrances. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Some people view [us] as a giant sorority,&quot; Brod told On the Money, adding that the company has taken on some male-oriented clients recently, like Dollar Shave Club, Burger King and JackThreads. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But most of the employee perks at the company are aimed at women. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OPI sends a manicurist twice a month; Brod also offers complimentary haircuts, blow outs and spray tanning, all conducted in the fully equipped office salon.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The 65 women who work at the firm also have access to an endless supply of free beauty products that make the office look like an aisle at Sephora.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of the swag is also offered to visitors and clients, Brod confessed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hemsworth it  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hollywood actor and Australia's global tourism ambassador, Chris Hemsworth, is back in New York, inviting Americans Down Under. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hemsworth signed on as Australia's ambassador in January of last year, launching the country's popular coastal and aquatic campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now he's back for a private &quot;virtual tour&quot; of Australia at an event Monday night, ahead of Australia Day on Thursday.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The event's invited guests include VIPs Naomi Watts, Deborra-Lee Furness and Rebecca Breeds, along with Aussie tourism minister Steve Ciobo. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Australia is seeing record visits by Americans. Arrivals from the US have crossed the 700,000 mark, reaching 705,000 in the past 12 months, up 18.3 percent.  </SPAN></P>
