<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why are the Democrats getting so worked up over Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remarks about Russia hacking Clinton's &quot;lost&quot; e-mails (&quot;Kerfuffle Over Czar Wars,&quot; July 28)? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   One would think that Clinton would want them discovered in order to prove she sent 30,000 e-mails about yoga classes and her daughter's wedding. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Ron Perri </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Metuchen, NJ </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's beyond comprehension how anybody can believe that if the Democratic National Committees e-mails were hacked, Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server wasn't hacked, too. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Experts and the FBI have said Clinton's e-mail server was very vulnerable to attacks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   There's little question in anybody's mind that Russia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other adversaries had access to top-secret information because of this. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Al DiLascia </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Chicopee, Mass. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How absurd: Democrats are calling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;treasonous&quot; for his tongue-in-cheek remarks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was actually throwing digs at the liberal media standing in front of him. All he did was sarcastically suggest that he'd be happy if the missing e-mails turned up. That's the last thing the Clintons or the media want.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How could Russia even break into a server that doesn't even exist anymore to steal deleted e-mails?  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Mike Pence has any integrity, he'll resign as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> running mate so </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can pick Vladimir Putin instead. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I had a good laugh after the Russian hackers released thousands of the DNC's anti-Bernie Sanders e-mails. This gave DNC officials a black eye.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took heat when he jokingly invited the Russians to release the thousands of e-mails Hillary erased. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The chilling thought is that if the Russians do so, it proves that many foreign governments have the ability to get information, secret or not, and use it against our country.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The liberal media are trying to make a mountain out of a mole hill.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Melania </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supposed plagiarism was a non-story, and so is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asking Russia to find Hillary's missing e-mails. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Believe me, I'd estimate 80 percent of Americans would like to see those deleted e-mails as well. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Bellerose </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How could it be &quot;encouraging espionage&quot; or a &quot;national security issue&quot; if the 30,000 deleted e-mails were only about Clinton's personal business like yoga classes, Chelsea Clinton's wedding and her mother's funeral?  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Tampa, Fla. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The spin is on: Instead of going after outgoing DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other Democratic head honchos, the media has stepped in for Hillary's campaign to divert attention away from the DNC and blamed the Russians. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nice try, but even Bernie supporters aren't buying that - and they buy everything. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Boston, Mass. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fact that newspapers felt the need to blame </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in connection with the hacking of the DNC, but not scold the DNC for a biased nomination process rigged against Bernie the entire time, proves that they're completely irrelevant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Hillary's e-mails are released and show she took money as bribes, who are the papers going to blame?  </SPAN></P>
