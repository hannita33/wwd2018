<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The call came in to 311 from Queens, reporting that &quot;Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was in their back yard.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But this was no campaign stop.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meet Donald the pheasant (left) - a bird with the best, most amazing, most tremendous golden-orange crest atop its head. And, yes, it's real.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;Someone called and said that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was in their back yard and could someone from Animal Care and Control come pick him up - especially because they are Democrats,&quot; said ACC spokeswoman Katy Hansen. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bird was a golden pheasant, native to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but popular in the States as an ornamental pet.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What it was doing in Queens April 7 remains a mystery. ACC officials said that they could not disclose where they picked up Donald, only that they took him to the Wild Bird Fund, an avian hospital and rehab center on the Upper West Side. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He likes strutting around the place,&quot; said Rita McMahon, the center's executive director. &quot;He's quite the man about town. He is very interested in the other female birds here - even though they're not his species.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;He actually tries to mount some of the ducks. There's one in particular named Siena. And she's not opposed to it!&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McMahon suspects the yard-long bird was ordered online by folks who probably did not have a permit - or any idea how far it could fly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald will get a permanent home in upstate Rensselaer County in about two weeks, she said.  </SPAN></P>
