<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now he gets tough? President Obama's actions against Russia - booting 35 suspected spies, closing two government compounds and sanctioning its intelligence agencies - are certainly deserved.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As House Speaker Paul Ryan noted, they are &quot;an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy&quot; with Moscow. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But, frankly, it's a little too little, too late. After all, kicking out spies should be par for the course. And the hacking, while troubling, was - let's be honest - minor compared to the evils Russia committed with impunity during Obama's tenure.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Besides, the FBI first informed the Democratic National Committee over a year ago that its e-mails had been hacked. And though a top administration aide met with Russian officials in April to complain about cyberattacks, the White House chose not to disclose them for months. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You've certainly got to question Obama's motives and timing. Consider, why was there no similarly appropriate response when Russia invaded Crimea, moved to destabilize Ukraine or supplied the missile that downed a Malaysian plane, killing 298? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Or when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hacked the Office of Personnel Management, exposing the records of 22 million government employees? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yes, Obama eventually sanctioned some of Vladimir Putin's oligarch friends. But he nixed more forceful action, like resurrecting a missile-defense plan for Eastern Europe and offering non-lethal aid to Ukraine. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fact is, Obama's indecision and failure to defend America's allies spurred Putin to push the envelope in Europe and Syria.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So what's going on now? First, Obama hopes to bolster the absurd Democratic notion that Russia &quot;stole&quot; the election, undermining Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> legitimacy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also may think his moves will commit </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and leave him at odds with Russia, foiling the new president's goal of smoothing ties. One problem: Putin's not cooperating. He's refusing reciprocal sanctions and saying he'll seek a fresh start with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new team must beware; Putin isn't to be trusted. But let's hold the applause for Obama. As deserved as his moves against Russia may be, his hands are far from clean. </SPAN></P>
