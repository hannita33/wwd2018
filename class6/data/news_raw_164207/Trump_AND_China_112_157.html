<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Folks, it's time to wake up and smell the sunscreen. Bikini season is here - and that means working on a six-pack rather than drinking one. If you need help getting in shape before Labor Day, check out these magazines for getting swimsuit-worthy advice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Self </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Self talks to cover girl Sophie Turner, better known as Sansa Stark from HBO's &quot;Game of Thrones,&quot; about her role as Jean Gray in the summer tentpole film &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse.&quot; The result is a little bit more interesting than her Wikipedia page - for instance, she's a blonde and not a redhead in real life - but it doesn't go far beyond that. An interview with Olympic gold medalist Gabrielle Douglas morphs into a story about how &quot;exercise is an expression of your personality.&quot; This magazine is fine for reading whenever you make it onto the elliptical machine, but don't expect much else. The number of ads featuring chocolate: 3. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shape </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shape magazine is getting lazy, which is why it's a poor choice for readers looking to get whipped into shape. &quot;Give in to your urge to splurge&quot; oozes one feature with a picture of a perfect chocolate cake. &quot;Including decadent foods (even cake!) in your diet can actually help you shed pounds,&quot; it declares. Elsewhere, it's hard to find an article about cutting calories or tightening abs. Kate Hudson, in her cover story, says she &quot;absolutely believe[s] in enjoying my food, especially when I travel.&quot; There's zero mention of how she's rich and famous and can afford personal trainers. Skip this mag. Ads with chocolate: 5. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Health </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Health actually goes a bit deeper than the epidermal with its cover model, US Women's Soccer gold medalist Alex Morgan. The 26-year-old forward highlights the gender gap and blasts FIFA for paying women far less than men. In other indignities, women play on synthetic turf while the men's teams play on grass. &quot;That's just proof to us that FIFA doesn't see us as equals to the men,&quot; she says. It's worth picking up for the interview, even if the rest of the mag is pretty interchangeable with the others. Ads with chocolate: 5 </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Women's Health </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Women's Health gets another &quot;X-Men&quot; star, Olivia Munn, for its cover story. The actress blasts sports media for blaming her during her boyfriend Aaron Rodger's losing streak with the Green Bay Packers last year. The magazine does a pretty good job of being an overall read, rather than just the usual workout regimens and diet tips. There's even a music section that, amazingly, recommends Brian Eno's &quot;Ambient 1: Music for Airports&quot; for &quot;melting stress.&quot; Bravo. Ads with chocolate: 3. With caramel: 2. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New Yorker </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With Memorial Day come and gone, the liberal media has come down with a case of heat exhaustion with respect to the White House race. In &quot;Talk of the Town,&quot; the New Yorker touches upon the increasingly uncomfortable subject of Bill Clinton, and the mixed effects he seems to be having on Hillary's campaign - getting roped into half-hour debates with millennial campaigners for Bernie Sanders, for example. Bill &quot;is not the presence that he was, physically, or politically&quot; when he was president,&quot; Amy Davidson notes. Meanwhile, financial columnist James Surowiecki, invoking some research about the psychology of financial losses, makes the interesting case that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters are in a gambling mood. Not good for Hillary's supposed appeal as a safe choice. Good thing this is the summer fiction issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New York </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New York slaps Hillary on its cover this week, declaring that &quot;there is nothing simple about Hillary Clinton.&quot; Inside, we get a strenuous attempt at a puff piece that insists that when you get up close, Hillary is actually a great gal - warm, charismatic, smart, etc., etc. Given this interesting information, it's never explained why Hillary won't let reporters near her on the campaign trail. Apparently, in exchange for the special access she got, writer Rebecca Traister was polite enough not to ask this question. Elsewhere, Frank Rich makes the case that &quot;the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> candidacy looks a lot more like Reagan's than anyone might care to notice.&quot; Smart piece, Frank. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Atlantic </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, the Atlantic, which recently lost top editor James Bennet to the New York Times, shows the perils of allowing a nonjournalist to write a cover story. In this case, it's a 13-page sprawler on &quot;the mind of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; written by a psychology professor at Northwestern University. &quot;Who, really, is Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">?&quot; Dan McAdams asks in what the candidate himself might call an &quot;incredibly weak&quot; final paragraph. &quot;I can discern little more than narcissistic motivations and a complementary personal narrative about winning at any cost.&quot; Thanks - we could have gleaned that by reading the inside flap of &quot;The Art of the Deal.&quot; Better to check out the thought-pieces on free will and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shrinking population. </SPAN></P>
