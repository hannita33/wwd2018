<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was important to hear Hillary Clinton speculate about the potential failures of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign policy (&quot;Hillary Describes Hillary,&quot; Editorial, June 3). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton gave a 43-minute speech on her foreign policy.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But she spent 33 minutes of it droning on and on about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. That's her foreign policy? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   No wonder President Obama and Clinton messed things up around the world over the last seven years. They don't even know what foreign policy is.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's how she plans to defeat Islamic terror, by attacking </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's what she'll do with the Iran nuke problem? Tell us we should be afraid of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? That's how she'll deal with ISIS, Russia and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Scott </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hillary has a long track record; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should attack it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She seems calculated, but she's really not. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All she has on him are hypotheticals and what he might have said at some point. She's baiting him to say something that will cost him dearly.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should take the high road. It'll pay off in November. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Her e-mails aren't an issue for me. I don't care about them. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What I do care about, however, is how she conducted herself as secretary of state. She didn't act in the best interests of the United States or its partners. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She says &quot;Look at my vast experience,&quot; but what has she accomplished? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nothing positive came from any of her decisions. After all the lies over the Iranian deal, how can the people trust her?  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We'll wind up with nothing better than President Obama 2.0. </SPAN></P>
