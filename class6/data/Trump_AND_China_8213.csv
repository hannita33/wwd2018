September 27, 2016	USA TODAY	Provocative Trump, who unexpectedly claimed the Republican presidential nomination over a dozen rivals with stronger political résumés? Or Presidential Trump, who in recent weeks has toned down his rhetoric and, in another political surprise, managed to pull even with rival Hillary Clinton in national and battleground polls? In response to the opening question, Trump repeated his signature, dire view of the state of the nation. "We have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us," he said, decrying the threat from Mexico and China. "We have to stop our jobs from leaving the United States and with it firing all our people."  Clinton's response to the first question reflected her signature devotion to policy, working in bullet-point references to infrastructure investment, a higher minimum wage, equal pay for women, profit-sharing for workers, paid family leave, earned sick days, affordable child care and debt-free college. Later, she said, "Donald thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese; I think it's real." Trump protested she was wrong, although he tweeted exactly that. And within minutes, they were interrupting one another and talking over one another. The setting inside the debate hall at Hofstra University looked dignified enough to fit in the White House itself, with a dark blue backdrop, a discrete band of white stars and a depiction of a golden eagle soaring over the two contenders. But the mood surrounding the opening forum was almost gladitorial, reaching Super Bowl-size levels of hype. No presidential election in modern times has defied the conventional wisdom as much this one, which has ended up pitting a political neophyte and reality-TV star against the wife of a former president, a member of the family that defines the Democratic establishment. And no presidential debate in the television age has been more hotly anticipated. They walked out from opposite sides of the stage, Clinton in a red jacket and slacks, Trump in a gray suit and bright blue tie. They shook hands, greeted the moderator, and retreated to the podiums. A few hours before the debate, Trump did needle Clinton on Twitter, a platform he has perfected as a political weapon. "My team of deplorables will be managing my Twitter account for this evenings debate," he wrote, a reference to her description at a fundraiser of his followers as a "basket of Deplorables." Those jibes might not seem to have set the landscape for a debate focused on the challenge of overhauling America's tax system or the imperative to devise fresh approaches to the civil war in Syria. Indeed, much of the attention was focused on whether Trump could project restraint for a full 90 minutes, and whether Clinton convincingly could convey a sense of trustworthiness. History demonstrates that the opening debate can be powerful enough to boost a candidate (John Kennedy in 1960, Ronald Reagan in 1980) or wound one, with lasting consequences (Michael Dukakis in 1988, Al Gore in 2000). Eleven campaigns have included debates in the television age, since John Kennedy shined against Richard Nixon in 1960. Being seen as the winner of the first debate hasn't guaranteed a victory in November. But in nine of the 11, it shaped the trajectory of the campaign that followed. They typically have had the most impact when an incumbent president isn't running, and when a candidate comes in with something to prove, and when the contest is close and fluid. That is, in a campaign like this one. First debates are powerful because it's a time when some voters begin to pay close attention. At an hour-and-a-half, the conversation is more extended and more grueling than any 30-second hour or 10-minute interview.
November 15, 2016	USA TODAY	Steve Balough lives 2,000 miles from Silicon Valley, but it might as well be on the other side of the world. "We don't have many jobs here," says Balough, 65, a high school teacher in West Plains, Mo., who voted for President-elect Donald Trump. "We have lumber mills, but a few shoe and clothing factories got shipped out. As far as we're concerned, the two coasts and the Midwest are two different cultures. It's like Europe is different than America." Trump's victory over Clinton -- an outcome few in the tech industry supported and many failed to believe would happen -- has engendered a mix of shock, anger, grief and denial in Silicon Valley. It's also prompted many to ask: Why and how did the companies that have become the most valuable in the U.S.  lose touch with great pools of their customers?  One thing seems certain: While many of those voters engaged with this election using the fruits of the tech industry's latest advances, sharing curated news on Facebook, settling arguments via Google and checking notifications on an Apple iPhone, few thought they were enjoying a direct economic benefit from the U.S. tech industry. In some cases, it has hurt them. Steel mills "can't keep up with cheap imports" or advances in technology, says Ray Rogg, 54, a steel worker from Erlanger, Ky. "The more automated and technical things are, and with better computers, it eliminates people," says Rogg, who has worked 26 years at the TMK Ipsco mill in Wilder, Ky. "It winds up streamlining things and taking away jobs." The tech boom may have created vast wealth and a swath of  high-paying jobs  around metro areas such as San Francisco and Seattle, but a nationwide surge in tech jobs has failed to follow. Much of the Rust Belt, South and Midwest are still reeling from the economic dislocations of globalization, the financial crisis and a technology-driven boom in productivity. "Manufacturing jobs in the current economy are going away -- we are moving to a service economy," says Steve Bennet, an adjunct professor at San Jose State University who specializes in entrepreneurship and venture capital. In interviews with Trump voters across the nation, they described themselves as working men and women who  want decent-paying jobs, with affordable health care, so they can take care of themselves and their families. Many ultimately overlooked Trump's off-putting comments because their underlying fear and anxiety about the economy runs deep. Deep red, in fact. Trump handily beat Hillary Clinton 70%-26% in counties dominated by manufacturing, according to exit polls by Edison Research. He rolled to a 60%-37% advantage in the 121 reporting counties with the highest rates of unemployment. Silicon Valley's success hasn't translated to jobs, as machines and on-demand work replace low- and middle-income work. Employment at computer and electronic companies has plummeted 45% since the 1990s, according to Labor Department statistics. They employed 1.03 million in the U.S. in August, down from 1.87 million in 2001. In the same 15-year period, total employment at semiconductor makers was halved, to 359,000. "Trump's blue-collar supporters aren't likely to be fans of the 1099 (sharing) economy," says Rakesh Agrawal, a former PayPal exec who runs freelance-marketplace Redesign Mobile. "They grew up with stable jobs with good work-life balance, cheap health care and employer-paid pensions. That is not today's economy, and that's certainly not the gig economy that Silicon Valley is creating." Hardware production has shifted overseas, as exemplified by Apple's large manufacturing facilities in China and Ireland and chip maker Micron's massive offshoring of jobs to Asia. Yet while the blue-collar voter came out for Trump, that didn't tell the full story: 48% of his voters made $100,000 a year or more and 43% held college degrees, according to exit polls. "I was intrigued by a non-establishment figure, and I agreed with his policies on immigration and health care," says Mika Pittman, 44, an IT administrator from Princeton, Minn. Automated technology and services have allowed start-ups to keep their workforces austere -- WhatsApp had 55 people when Facebook acquired it for $21.8 billion in 2014. And tech whizzes at Amazon, Tesla Motors and elsewhere have come up with high-end production lines in the U.S. that minimize people. Companies such as Amazon and Walmart are seen as marginalizing opportunities for small businesses. "Washington ignores small business," says Maxine Gutman, 56, an insurance attorney in Parkland, Fla. "I support Trump for his business background." "The economy was No. 1 for me," says Randy Herschelman, 58, a technical recruiter in Dallas. "(Trump) understands the bottom line and will delegate the right people to execute his agenda. Obamacare and taxation are killing the middle class." The future, meanwhile, is expected to bring drones, robots, driverless cars and machine learning that further reduce demand for jobs. "Digital technology is at ground zero of what's happening. It delivers enormous benefits but it also has enormous costs," says Paul Saffo, a futurist based in Silicon Valley. "The bad news is that technology accelerates the disruption in jobs. The good news is that technology gives people a place to complain about it when they don't have a job."
December 27, 2016	USA TODAY	After being ostracized by the  industry for most of the election year, there sat venture capitalist Peter Thiel, beaming, to the left of President-elect Donald Trump at the Trump Tower Tech summit in mid-December. Around him was a ring of glum-faced and pensive tech titans, including Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Alphabet's Larry Page and Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg.  Silicon Valley's billionaire leaders had disavowed Trump during the campaign, throwing their weight behind  Hillary Clinton. Only Thiel stumped for Trump, and after the tech industry had turned on him for that and his role in Gawker's failure, he was luxuriating in the I-told-you-so moment. The display of power portends a roiling year or two in tech. Trump railed against Amazon and Apple in tweets about corporate taxes and cyber security; now he's likely to shape those issues as well as immigration reform, job creation, trade with China, deregulation and more as he vowed during a bruising campaign. "Tech is unusual in that the industry does not depend on government regulation or transfer payments the way that banking, pharma, defense, agriculture and energy do," says Roger McNamee, founding partner of venture-capital firm Elevation Partners. "All tech needs is policy stability and access to global markets. Trump prides himself on being unpredictable." It was a topsy-turvy year for tech, which generated $3.5 trillion in domestic economic output and accounted for more than 15 million people, or 8.4% of total U.S. employment, according to the Computer Technology Association. There were winners and losers among companies and technologies; new faces emerged while others faded; and driverless cars and drones became more visible in our streets and sky. Whether computer breaches that compromised the personal information of millions of consumers to a targeted hack by Russian operatives that conceivably tilted the U.S. presidential election, the very nature of conflict transformed this year, McNamee says. And with the advent of the Internet of Things, the battlefield could extend to our homes, security experts warn. Samsung's stumble with the self-igniting Galaxy Note 7 was an epic meltdown of quality control, distribution and marketing. Though it didn't dislodge the South Korean electronics giant as the pre-eminent smartphone seller globally, it undercut  trust. Yahoo disclosed it had been the victim of two megahacks that compromised more than 1.5 billion accounts and jeopardized its $4.8 billion deal with Verizon. Artificial intelligence is officially a craze -- Facebook, Apple, Google and Microsoft are among those with aggressive plans. Virtual reality became more of a reality. Drones are popping up in all shapes and sizes. Self-driving cars took to the streets in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and California. Fully autonomous cars won't be available for a few years, but a Morgan Stanley study estimates they will lead to productivity gains of $507 billion annually as consumers spend less time commuting and more time in meetings, writing reports and other business tasks. There was nothing fake, however, over fears on what AI and increased automation will do to the workforce. This is sure to draw the attention of Trump, who lambasted Apple for exporting jobs overseas and discussed jobs creation at the  tech summit. His focus on immigration reform will undoubtedly pinch H-1B visas and heighten the urgency for increased STEM education. What is unclear is how it might play into tech's stuttering attempts to become less homogenous by hiring more of the women and minorities who buy its products but have little role in their design. There are 500,000 computing jobs open in the U.S., with an expected 20% growth rate over the next decade -- yet only 55,000 bachelor degrees in computer science were doled out in 2014, according to Code.org and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "It's more important than ever," says Dennis Yang, CEO of Udemy, an online learning marketplace with more than 14 million students in 190 countries. Tech's impasse with the Trump administration over job creation seems inevitable, but there may be hope. In his meeting with the reluctant CEOs, Trump vowed to keep the channels of communication open and meet quarterly. 
January 4, 2017	USA TODAY	The auto industry's showdown with Donald Trump over made-in-Mexico, sold-in-the-U.S. vehicles revved up Tuesday as  General Motors and Ford  moved to fend off attacks on their commitment to American manufacturing. Ford announced it would cancel a planned  $1.6 billion Mexico plant and expand a Michigan factory, creating 700 jobs, after withering criticism from Trump.  Earlier, General Motors was forced to defend its Chevrolet Cruze production in Mexico after Trump tweeted: "Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!" The developments illustrate the new era of give-and-take for Detroit's Big 3 automakers, whose relationship with the president-elect figures to be complex. On one hand, there's a gaping divide between U.S. automakers and Trump on trade. Trump wants to renegotiate or trash the industry's treasured North American Free Trade Agreement, which he blames for weakening American manufacturing. He also has threatened  a 35% tariff on American companies' products made overseas and sold in the U.S. In other ways, however, the auto industry is welcoming change, even after eight years of a White House that rescued GM and Chrysler from liquidation. "Automakers are facing a situation where they have to consider the political consequences" of their decisions, AutoTrader.com analyst Michelle Krebs says. A: Yes. Labor costs for automotive assembly are 80% lower in Mexico than in the U.S., according to a report in August 2016 by the Center for Automotive Research. Although security and transportation costs are higher in Mexico, the country still offers considerably lower cost of production, particularly on small, fuel-efficient cars with thin profit margins.  So shifting production back to the U.S. likely would hurt the bottom line for automakers and suppliers. "That could have a pretty substantial impact on profitability," LMC Automotive analyst Jeff Schuster says. A: Hard to say, since details are lacking. But few in the industry believe the threatened 35% tariff is actually feasible. "I believe 35% is almost inflammatory," says Michael Harley, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, noting Ford's 2016 profitability could have been wiped out if it had to pay the tariff. "It gets everyone's attention, but it's nearly impossible." Still, the pressure on the auto industry  could be persistent. That could have major ramifications on future decisions on automakers' global operations. "We're going to see pressure from Trump and his tweets, and you are going to see public scrutiny," he says. A: Possibly, especially if  automakers can pull off announcements that generate  headlines for Trump to trumpet while making few substantive changes to their actual policies. Optics may matter more than substance. But don't expect a significant shift in manufacturing from Mexico to the U.S. The Center for Automotive Research projected that the U.S. share of North American automotive production would fall from an all-time low of 63% in 2016 to 58% in 2020. A: Not for now. If Trump follows through on the threat of a 35% tariff, Mexican-made cars will likely become more expensive for American consumers. Theoretically, though, "it might end up with more jobs here," Center for Automotive Research analyst Kristin Dziczek says. "If we have more jobs, more employment and wages go up, and prices go up too, that's OK. If wages don't go up and prices go up, that's a problem." A: Ulterior motives. Although expanding in Mexico makes financial sense, automakers may be willing to relinquish some Mexico production plans in exchange for  concessions in other areas. Currying favor with the Trump administration is  important to the auto industry, which wants Washington to loosen fuel-economy regulations and avoid a potentially devastating trade war with China. Ford's move reflects that strategy, Schuster says. "There's clearly a lot going on that's below the surface of this," Schuster says. "It's likely to gain some influence on other activities that's coming down the road." 
December 7, 2016	USA TODAY	Telecommunication giant SoftBank Group plans to invest $50 billion into the U.S. economy, and add 50,000 jobs, President-elect Donald Trump announced  Tuesday. He made the announcement over Twitter after meeting with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son for 45 minutes at Trump Tower. The Japanese company has a majority stake in Sprint, whose plans to merge with rival T-Mobile were thwarted by the Obama administration.  Son's summit with Trump is very likely to rekindle the possibility of a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, wireless analyst Chetan Sharma says. "Today's visit is just groundwork for an inevitable deal," Sharma says. "Son has a strong interest in pursuing the merger." Son did not say what specific investments SoftBank would make, though he told The Wall Street Journal they would be part of a previously announced $100billion tech investment fund. "We were talking about it, and then I said I'd like to celebrate his presidential job," Son said at an impromptu news conference in the Trump Tower's lobby. Sprint  shares rallied as much as 7%, to $8.61, hitting a  52-week high, before ending 1.5% higher. T-Mobile shares rose 1.8%. In his unlikely march to the White House, Trump campaigned on bringing more jobs to America, particularly in  regions hit hard by the recession and globalization. He took swings at companies such as  Apple for making most of their products outside the USA. SoftBank is the second high-profile accord he's landed to underscore his message to voters. Last week, Trump announced a controversial deal to keep furnace manufacturer Carrier from outsourcing about 1,100 jobs to Mexico. Carrier will get $7 million in state tax incentives to keep the jobs in Indiana. Son, who became a billionaire through investments in Japan and China, is in the midst of raising a $100 billion fund with Saudi Arabia and others. He's had mixed results in the USA since SoftBank bought what is now an 80% stake in Sprint for $21.6 billion and lost ground to telecom rivals such as T-Mobile. SoftBank plunked down $32 billion this year to acquire ARM Holdings, a U.K.-based chip designer that makes parts for Apple's iPhone and other products.
March 15, 2016	USA TODAY	The American worker is being crushed. Workplace participation for women has declined by more than 3 percentage points since 2000. The percentage of men in their prime working years without a job has nearly tripled since the late 1960s. Median annual household incomes are down more than $4,000 from the beginning of the century.  One of the factors driving this economic devastation is America's disastrous trade policies.  Under decades of failed leadership, the U.S. has gone from being the globe's manufacturing powerhouse to a rapid deindustrialization that has evaporated entire communities. The situation is about to get  worse if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is not stopped. One of the first casualties  will be America's auto industry, and among the worst victims of this pact will be the people of Ohio. The TPP will send America's remaining auto jobs to Japan. Yet, Gov. John Kasich, Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio have all promoted the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP -- a 12-nation pact -- includes Vietnam, which has vastly lower wages than America. Since there is a small market for U.S. goods in Vietnam, this will be an almost entirely one-sided arrangement as thousands of U.S. workers are laid off and production shipped to Vietnam instead. An Economic Policy Institute (EPI) analysis found that Ohio has  lost more than 100,000 jobs to TPP countries. If the deal is enacted as Kasich has urged, those numbers will skyrocket. TPP is the biggest betrayal in a long line of betrayals where politicians have sold out U.S. workers. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1993, we've lost approximately 900,000 jobs to Mexico alone, pro-labor EPI found. Yet Gov. Kasich voted for NAFTA, just like he now supports TPP. China has been one of the worst offenders. While promoting China's addition to the World Trade Organization in 2001, the U.S. agreed to permanently confer on China  "most favored nation" trading status. EPI estimates that the United States has lost 3 million jobs to China since that decision was made. Overall, since 1997 -- driven by NAFTA and China -- the U.S. has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs, EPI analysis shows. We've lost over 80,000 factories during that time. I am the only candidate who will bring our manufacturing jobs back. I have been warning for decades what would happen if we didn't confront foreign trade cheating, and sadly, my fears have come to pass as the United States has seen its trade deficit in goods soar to $759.3 billion last year. If we bring back these jobs, and close this trade deficit, we will create millions of jobs, boost government revenue, shrink our deficit, rebuild our infrastructure and communities, and send wages soaring upwards. Under a Trump administration, we will finally stand up for American workers and make America great again.
May 10, 2016	USA TODAY	Tough-talking political maverick Rodrigo Duterte took a commanding lead in the Philippines' presidential election Monday with most votes counted. Duterte has claimed victory, telling the AFP: "It's with humility, extreme humility, that I accept this, the mandate of the people. What I can promise you is that I will do my very best not just in my waking hours but even in my sleep." Duterte, 71, the mayor of the southern city of Davao who has drawn comparisons to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, had 38.7% of the vote, Manuel "Mar" Roxas, 23.3%, and Grace Poe, 21.7%, with 90% of the precincts reporting.  After Poe called Duterte to congratulate him, she gave a short concession speech in Tagalog at her Manila campaign headquarters. Poe told supporters that they ran a good campaign and that she respected the results of the polls. The final result may come as early as Tuesday. About 55 million out of a total population of 100 million people were expected to cast ballots. Duterte's political rise has come amid vows to be tough on crime and corruption. However, he has courted controversy throughout the campaign, making an almost endless stream of off-color remarks from bragging about his womanizing ways to crude comments about gang rape to publicly cursing Pope Francis. As mayor of Davao on restive Mindanao Island, Duterte has won praise from supporters for cleaning up the city's drug and crime problems, but he has advocated unusual and violent tactics including using death squads. According to Human Rights Watch, Duterte is responsible for 1,000 extrajudicial killings. The outspoken Duterte also has been called "The Punisher" and "Duterte Harry," a play on Clint Eastwood's  Dirty Harry "If I make it to the presidential palace, I will do just what I did as mayor. You drug pushers, holdup men and do-nothings, you better go out. Because as the mayor, I'd kill you," Duterte said during his last campaign stop on Saturday. He vowed to execute 100,000 more criminals and dump their bodies in Manila Bay. In a televised interview after the polls closed Monday, Duterte said that if he were elected, his top priority in his first 100 days would be fixing government and stopping corruption. "I can do that immediately as president," he said. "Then I have to go after the drug problem and of course the criminals in this country," he told Philippine news agency Rappler. "I will do everything to serve the interests of the Filipino people, even if it would cost my life, honor and the office of the president," Duterte said. Police said at least 15 people were killed in election-related violence and more than 4,000 arrested for violating a gun ban, according to the Associated Press. "This is the most polarizing election the Philippines has had since the fall of the Marcos dictatorship in 1986," said Richard Javad Heydarian, a professor of political science at De La Salle University in the Philippines. "And that in itself doesn't bode very well for the country in terms of post-election national unity." The administration of Aquino, who is limited to a single six-year term, has made major strides improving the Philippines' economy, which has emerged from being "the sick man of Asia" to one of the region's fastest-growing economies, averaging more than 6% annual growth and upgrading its sovereign credit rating. "I think growth will, more likely than not, continue," Ramon del Rosario Jr., chairman of the Makati Business Club, told a group of Filipino journalists this past week. A more significant change may lie ahead on the geopolitical front, where the Philippines has been locked in a territorial dispute with an increasingly assertive Chinese military presence in the South China Sea. Under the Aquino administration, the Philippines has primarily relied on support from the United States, signing an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement to allow a greater presence of U.S. troops and facilities at Philippine bases. The Philippines has also turned to the international community, with a pending case against China at the International Arbitration Court in the Hague, Netherlands, over China's "nine-dotted line" that claims jurisdiction over much of the South China Sea. China has refused to participate in the arbitration, which is being held under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. 
December 22, 2016	USA TODAY	Apple CEO Tim Cook said he felt it was necessary to "engage" when President-elect Donald Trump -- who has railed against Apple and other tech firms -- invited him and about a dozen tech executives to attend a summit in New York last week.  "Personally, I've never found being on the sideline a successful place to be," Cook told employees on Apple's internal employee information service. "The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it's in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage. "And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it's very important to do that because you don't change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best. In many ways, it's a debate of ideas." Cook and some of tech's biggest names -- Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, among them -- met with Trump to discuss jobs, immigration policy, China, cybersecurity and corporate tax rates. "Some of our key areas of focus are on privacy and security, education," Cook said. "They're on advocating for human rights for everyone, and expanding the definition of human rights. They're on the environment and really combating climate change, something we do by running our business on 100% renewable energy." Trump, who dinged Apple over security and jobs and Amazon on corporate taxes, told the assembled execs at Trump Tower, "I want to add that I'm here to help you folks do well." Trump called the meeting productive, but many in Silicon Valley questioned the participation of the executives, most of whom supported Democrat Hillary Clinton. "We very much stand up for what we believe in," Apple's CEO concluded. "We think that's a key part of what Apple is about. And we'll continue to do so." 
December 14, 2016	USA TODAY	But in a globalized world, saving U.S. jobs is more complex than slapping tariffs on companies that manufacture goods elsewhere. Executives talking about the issue highlight that the shift of jobs to Mexico is far from the threat that has been commonly portrayed during the election and since. A: It's hard to pinpoint a number but, many offshorable jobs are already gone. A decade or so ago, about 200,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs annually were shifting abroad either because American producers moved overseas to cut costs or U.S. businesses switched from domestic to cheaper foreign suppliers. But that gap has closed.  Meanwhile, crossborder trade traffic with Mexico was flat in 2015 compared with 2014 levels, Robert Knight, chief financial officer at Union Pacific railroad, said in June at an investor presentation. Union Pacific would know, as it's a key transporter of goods between the countries. It handles 80% of automotive trade traffic, which is one of the most important industries between Mexico and the U.S. Traffic in and out of Mexico accounts for 11% of Union Pacific's total traffic. The U.S. lost 2.3 million factory jobs in the recession that began in 2007, and 8 million have been lost since the late 1970s. But the U.S. has added about 800,000 factory jobs since March 2010. Boston Consulting expects more than 1 million manufacturing jobs to be added in the country by 2020, in part because of reshoring. "There has been tremendous growth in U.S. exports into Mexico," Michael Upchurch, chief financial officer at Kansas City Southern, said in November at an industry conference. Agricultural products, such as corn, pork and poultry are being imported to Mexico from the U.S. at a widening pace, he said. Mexico also imports steel and auto parts from the U.S. so automobiles can be assembled there. "Certainly you can point to examples where plants have closed in the U.S. and potentially some jobs have shifted," Upchurch said. But "with the trade growth, there are a number of estimates that would suggest NAFTA supports roughly 14 million jobs in the U.S. And so we think, net-net, this has been a positive trade agreement for all the countries involved." A: U.S. manufacturing costs have actually come more in line with the rest of the world. The U.S., for several years, has been closing the competitive gap with other countries as a place to make goods sold in America. Chinese wages, which have been lower than  Mexico, have climbed about 15% annually since the early 2000s, says Harry Moser, head of the Reshoring Initiative. Meanwhile, U.S. manufacturing wages are up 14% since the recession ended in June 2009. All told, average production costs in the U.S. are only about 5% higher than in China after factoring in reduced shipping costs, says Hal Sirkin, senior partner with the Boston Consulting Group. Fifteen years ago, the differential was about 20%, Moser says. Also, U.S. energy is relatively inexpensive, partly as a result of the boom in drilling for natural gas, used as a feedstock for plastics and chemicals. Companies want to deliver products to store shelves more rapidly to meet to shifting customer needs. When products are manufactured closer to where they will ultimately be sold, that helps companies with their goal to get goods to consumers faster. A: The pool of skilled labor where workers are able to operate technical computer-assisted production equipment in the U.S. is attractive, even to companies that shift low-skill jobs south. Becton, Dickinson is shifting some jobs to Mexico but adding manufacturing capacity -- and jobs -- in new ways in the U.S. The U.S. based medical device maker announced in July it was closing a factory in Creedmoor, N.C., and in Tucker, Ga., affecting 185 jobs. Of those, 65 positions were moved to a company facility in Mexico. But  80 jobs  were moved to other plants in the U.S., company spokesman Troy Kirkpatrick says. Forty jobs were eliminated in this restructuring, but the company invested $100 million in its plant in Holdrege, Neb., and another $20 million in the plant in Sandy, Utah. The bottom line? The company has more U.S. manufacturing jobs now than it did five years ago. A: Even if Trump punishes  with tariffs, global companies can find ways around them. Regal Beloit, a maker of electric motors, does 40% of its production in Mexico and looks for "low-cost" regions to work along with its U.S. facilities, Charles Hinrichs, chief financial officer at the company, said at a Nov. 30 industry conference. If Trump were to put a 25% tariff on goods coming in from Mexico, the company can make the same goods in India, China, Thailand or the U.S. and avoid the protectionism, he says. A: Some companies and industries, especially automotive, are so established in Mexico that a tariff won't be enough incentive to close down there, said Joseph Massaro, chief financial officer at auto parts maker Delphi, in November. Delphi has 70,000 employees in Mexico. "I think the worst case will be, there may be some additional cost to doing business in Mexico from either a vehicle assembly perspective or a parts perspective," he says. "I don't think it would be a cost that would do harm to the industry." Todd Bluedorn, CEO of heating and cooling gear maker Lennox, said in October before the election, "We've consistently said we're not done moving to Mexico, and we're not." Ford CEO Mark Fields told The Associated Press on Dec. 9 that Trump's actions would not stop its plans to move production of the Ford Focus from Michigan to Mexico. But he also said no U.S. jobs would be lost since the Michigan plant would be used to make two new models of cars. Trump's threats to slap offshoring companies with tariffs could lead companies looking at Mexican production to pause in the near term. But Moser says, "Over the long term, it's not a sustainable model." 
January 4, 2017	USA TODAY	What a difference a year makes. The U.S. stock market kicked off the first day of trading of 2017 with solid gains, a year after plunging in the opening session of 2016 on its way to its worst week to start a year ever. The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 stock index -- which closed up 0.5% to 2251 -- posted a gain on the first trading day of a new year for the first time since 2013.  Last year, the large-company stock index cratered 1.53% on January's first trading session -- its sixth-worst Day 1 percentage loss and worst annual kickoff since 2001 -- on its way to a worst-ever first week of the year decline of 5.96%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The S&P 500, however, rebounded and finished 2016 up 9.5%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose as much as 176 points before pulling back and finishing up 61 points, or 0.3%, to 19,824. The blue-chip index came within 105 points of 20,000 after a late-year flirtation with the milestone fell short. The technology-packed Nasdaq rose 0.5% higher, and the small-company Russell 2000 stock index, which gained 19.5% in 2016, finished flat. "When the final week of 2016 ended on a flat note, many people were wondering whether the Trump rally was fading," says Nick Sargen, senior investment adviser at Fort Washington Investment Advisors. The early-year optimism on Wall Street vs. the dark pessimism at the start of 2016 can be attributed to several key factors: Lack of panic triggers. "The poor start to 2016 was due to plummeting oil prices and concerns about China's currency, economy and stock market," says Sargen. Last year, U.S.-produced crude plunged to a 13-year low in January amid fears of a severe economic slowdown in China. A mainland China stock market crash prompted Bejing to halt trading on two days in the first week of 2016. This year, no such threats are visible. Oil, thanks to a late 2016 deal by OPEC and other oil producers to slash daily crude production,  pushed  back to a 16-month high of $55 per barrel earlier Tuesday. China's Shanghai stock index kicked off 2017 with a 1% gain Tuesday, extending its gains from its low point in January 2016 to 19%. Less threatening Fed, GDP outlook. "The Federal Reserve was threatening to raise interest rates four times at the beginning of 2016 at a time when commodity prices were tanking and the global economy was weakening. This time they suggest three rate hikes, but commodity prices are firm, oil has doubled since the February 2016 low and the U.S. and other economies are showing strength," says Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. "Trumponomics" is bullish. The president-elect's plans to slash corporate taxes, reduce burdensome regulations and spend on infrastructure is viewed as growth-friendly. "The Trump win is a win for business, which has huge ramifications ... as far as the eye can see," says Bittles. Pension fund selling ceases. Due to strong performance by the stock market relative to bonds in 2016, U.S. pension funds were forced to sell stocks and buy bonds so as not to have too large a helping of stocks. 
January 4, 2017	USA TODAY	In their first verbal standoff, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un indicated his country is in the final stages of testing a missile with a nuclear weapon that can reach the United States, and President-elect Donald Trump has vowed that it "won't happen." Trump's options for making good on that tweet sent Monday include everything  from diplomacy to a pre-emptive military strike.  Here are some options for dealing with the North Korean nuclear threat, according to former U.S. negotiators, arms control experts and analysts who have studied the region: Trump could start by trying to work with China rather than antagonize it, says Chris Hill, who led U.S. negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program  for President George W. Bush. "If there is a solution, that solution will be with China," North Korea's most important ally, says Hill, now dean of the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver. "The president-elect should be careful about picking fights with China over trade or the one-China policy because he will need a lot of his capital for North Korea." Since his election, Trump accepted a congratulatory phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. That was a breach of U.S. policy, which does not recognize Taiwan's sovereignty. (China considers Taiwan a breakaway province that someday will be reunited with the mainland.) Trump later questioned whether the United States "should be bound" by the "one China" policy, unless China cooperates on "other things, including trade." The "one China policy" recognizes the communist leaders in Beijing as the only legitimate Chinese government. "I would put cooperation with China on North Korea above any efforts to change the status quo of the Taiwan relationship or the (China-U.S.) trade relationship," Hill says. Trump could increase deterrence activities along with allies South Korea and Japan, says Richard Bush, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. That means moving ahead and expanding plans to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile shield that President Obama promised South Korea, where nearly 30,000 U.S. troops are stationed. It also means expanding live-fire joint exercises with South Korea and Japan, which would require North Korea to devote resources to monitor and respond to military activities on its borders. The U.S. also could fly more B-52 strategic bombers over North Korea and engage in more operations "to influence what's going on in the public mind of North Koreans," Bush says. Trump should offer North Korea economic aid if it agrees to stop testing nuclear weapons, says James Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The North participated in such negotiations with Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama, and  it agreed to deals it then cheated on and abandoned. Acton concedes that approach now is "unlikely to succeed," given North Korea's pattern, but he says it is worth trying again. "It's the least bad of a really bad bunch of options," he says. Increased sanctions on North Korea is another option, but it, too, has been tried and has failed to achieve the desired result. "Economic sanctions, increasing air deterrence efforts on the Korean peninsula and ... encouraging China to use economic means to pressure North Korea -- that package of actions and programs (is) connected to the realities we face," the Brookings Institution's Bush says. "It also sounds a lot like the Obama administration's policies." Despite sanctions, North Korea continues to conduct nuclear tests -- including two in 2016 -- and missile tests in violation of United Nations resolutions opposing them. If Trump wants to "quickly decapitate the head of the snake" and do it without mobilizing 100,000 U.S. troops to invade North Korea, he could order a military strike on the capital, Pyongyang, says Robert Kelley, a former director at the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency. Kelley, a fellow at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, says he is not advocating a nuclear strike, but Trump might consider the option. "In the short term it would remove the threat," Kelley says. "Presumably the nuclear weapons are located elsewhere, and commanders may have launch authority to use them in the event the leadership is destroyed," Acton says. "Going after Kim Jong Un and a large part of his leadership structure doesn't necessarily remove the threat." 
July 28, 2016	USA TODAY	Hillary Clinton's tenure as President Obama's first secretary of State from 2009 through January 2013 was marked by extreme turmoil in the Middle East. It included the Arab Spring protests, Iranian nuclear brinksmanship and withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq. Republican rival Donald Trump said her tenure at the State Department left a legacy of "death, destruction and weakness." Here is what Trump said, plus events before, during and after her time as secretary: Trump said: "In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. ... ISIS has spread across the region, and the world."  Before Clinton: The Islamic State was al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), which launched a bloody campaign against Iraq's Shiite majority and U.S. troops. AQI faded after an increase in U.S. troops in 2007 teamed up with Sunni tribes to fight the group. Clinton's role: Obama's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011 and the start of the Syrian civil war that year created turmoil that allowed AQI to re-emerge. Obama rejected Clinton's advice to take a more aggressive approach toward Syria to protect civilians and empower moderate rebels to topple Syrian President Bashar Assad's brutal regime. She saw the war as an opportunity to sever Syria's close alliance with Iran. It's not clear whether Clinton's approach would have prevented AQI from re-emerging and later branding itself as the Islamic State. After Clinton: Over the next three years, the Islamic State took advantage of instability in Syria to seize territory, but it did not gain international notoriety until it occupied portions of neighboring Iraq in June 2014, more than a year after Clinton left State. The group has since plotted or inspired followers to launch terrorist attacks around the world. Trump said: "Libya was cooperating. ... Libya is in ruins, and our ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers." Before Clinton: Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi renounced his nuclear weapons program in 2003 and allowed the United States and Britain to destroy his nuclear weapons infrastructure. Libya renounced terrorism as well, turning over terror suspects and paying compensation to the victims of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing all 259 aboard. Clinton's role: When the Arab Spring uprisings in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt spread to Libya in 2011, Gadhafi sought to crush the revolt. Clinton helped develop a NATO campaign to stop him. Libya's rebels gained momentum and overthrew Gadhafi. The ensuing power vacuum gave rise to militias, including al-Qaeda, which launched a terrorist attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans at a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012. In the following days, Clinton and the White House wrongly blamed a protest over an anti-Islam video and only later acknowledged there was no protest and it was a planned terrorist attack. Obama and Clinton had a plan for stabilizing Libya after Gadhafi's fall, but Libya's transitional government rejected any role for foreign troops. After Clinton: Multiple investigations by Clinton's State Department and Congress found that State provided inadequate security at the Benghazi post, but little more could have been done to protect the Americans once the attack began. Libya's warring factions formed a government this year, opening the door to U.S. assistance to defeat the Islamic State, which took advantage of the chaos to grab territory in parts of the country. Trump said: "Egypt was peaceful. ... Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim Brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control." Before Clinton: Egypt had been ruled for three decades by President Hosni Mubarak, a former general who crushed opponents but helped the United States and its ally, Israel, on counterterrorism and other regional issues. Clinton's role: When the Arab Spring spread to Egypt in 2011, Mubarak was ousted by his military. Clinton said in her memoir, Hard Choices, that she counseled Obama to proceed with caution toward Egypt, but he was swayed by idealism to support the democratic movement that unseated Mubarak. She sought to work with various post-Mubarak political parties, including the Muslim Brotherhood, a previously outlawed group that imposed hard-line Islamic rule in a country used to a secular government. In 2012, the first democratic elections brought to power a political party that represented the Muslim Brotherhood. After Clinton: In July 2013, after Clinton left, the Egyptian military overthrew the government of Mohammed Morsi and installed a general who was later elected president in voting that international monitors considered rigged. Before Clinton: Four years after President George W. Bush ordered the 2003 invasion of Iraq, 145,000 U.S. troops tamed an anti-U.S. insurgency. Obama pledged during his 2008 campaign to bring the troops home, and he did in 2011. Clinton's role: Clinton sought unsuccessfully to mediate between the Baghdad government and opposition groups to head off sectarian divisions. Her department failed to reach a deal with Baghdad on legal protections for a small contingent of U.S. forces that would remain to help keep the peace. Violence flared again as a government dominated by the country's Shiite majority pursued policies that alienated the country's Sunni Arab and Kurdish minorities. After Clinton: As a result, Sunni tribes that had helped the U.S. military defeat al-Qaeda welcomed the Islamic State fighters when the fellow Sunnis swept into Iraq from neighboring Syria in 2014. Obama agreed to send military trainers and advisers back to Iraq. More than 4,000 are there. Before Clinton: Iran sold oil at a steady rate and pursued nuclear weapons research during George W. Bush's presidency, according to the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency. Clinton's role: Obama and Clinton pursued a dual-track policy: strengthening international sanctions against Iran while making secret diplomatic overtures to end Iran's nuclear threat. New U.S. sanctions imposed by Congress and European sanctions urged by Clinton created severe economic hardship in Iran. China and Russia joined international sanctions, removing huge markets for Iranian petroleum. Iran expanded its nuclear program during this time, but its crude exports dropped in 2012 to their lowest level since 1986. After Clinton: Secret and overt moves by Obama and Clinton began early in Obama's first term. Formal negotiations under Clinton's successor, John Kerry, led to a final deal between Iran and six world powers in July 2015. It limited Iran's nuclear program in return for lifting sanctions. The United Nations says Iran has complied with the terms -- so far. Sanctions relief has made tens of billions of dollars available to fund Iran's anti-U.S. agenda, but the country has yet to enjoy the economic relief it hoped for because many U.S. sanctions remain in place, and international businesses remain wary of doing business there. Trump said: "Syria was under control. ... Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West." Before Clinton: Syria was a brutal dictatorship led by Assad, the president belonging to a minority Shiite sect and a close ally of Iran. Clinton's role: The Arab Spring uprising in Syria led to civil war in 2011 after Assad's military fired on unarmed democracy demonstrators. Clinton saw the uprising as an opportunity to disconnect Syria from the destabilizing influence of Iran. The U.S. ambassador to Syria encouraged democracy protesters. Clinton and other top advisers urged Obama to increase U.S. support to moderate, secular Syrian rebel groups and to impose a no-fly zone in Syria to prevent Assad's air force from targeting civilians. Obama rejected the advice. The precursor to the Islamic State formed as a militant army that took over areas in Syria vacated by retreating Assad troops. After Clinton: The Islamic State grew exponentially after Obama failed to follow through on his "red line" warning to Assad not to use chemical weapons. Assad used them against rebels in 2013, but the United States did not retaliate. After Clinton left office, Obama agreed to help train Syrian rebel groups to fight the Islamic State but not Assad. The civil war continues, causing hundreds of thousands of casualties. Half of Syria's prewar population of 22 million fled to neighboring countries, and many have sought refuge in Europe, creating a migrant crisis. 
October 20, 2016	USA TODAY	Donald Trump is ending his presidential bid the same way he began it: Defiant and provocative, breaking campaign norms and ignoring experts' advice -- and continuing to appeal to a slice of the American electorate ready to disrupt a political system they complain isn't working for them. The candidate himself has no shortage of grievances: Voter fraud he claims will take place in cities such as Chicago and Philadelphia. Polls he disputes that show him trailing Hillary Clinton by growing margins. A news media he labels as corrupt. "The press has created a rigged system and poisoned the mind of so many of our voters," he said at a campaign rally Tuesday in Colorado Springs, a lead-up to Wednesday's third presidential debate in Las Vegas.  As the debate opened with a clash over Supreme Court appointments, winning the White House would require the billionaire businessman to stage the most dramatic political comeback in modern American history. Clinton's national lead is the largest any candidate has held in decades three weeks before Election Day. But his new message -- that journalists and the political establishment are working in collusion against him to rig the election -- helps guarantee that his campaign will have a continuing impact even if he loses on Nov. 8. In some ways, Trump is like a bull trying to make sure as many teacups as possible are shattered before he leaves the china shop. Indeed, he doesn't seem to be making a concerted effort to reach out to independents and other swing voters by adopting a more presidential mien. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other senior Republicans have had no notable success in urging him to moderate his tone. Especially since the second debate, as he faces allegations of  sexual misconduct from a dozen women, he has been fiercely attacking Clinton's character and repeatedly complaining about a rigged election. That approach is designed to gin up his core supporters and, perhaps, discourage Clinton's supporters from showing up to vote. It also invites ridicule from Democrats. President Obama told him to "stop whining" and dismissed the idea that it would even be possible to rig the election, which depends on  independently run voting systems in each state and the District of Columbia. "I have never seen in my lifetime, or in modern political history, any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place," Obama said with apparent astonishment at a White House news conference Tuesday. Of course, Clinton has her own problems. She is on the defensive over the WikiLeaks release of thousands of emails that among other things contain purported excerpts from cozy speeches she delivered to Wall Street bankers. An FBI document that was just released suggests that a senior State Department official and an FBI official discussed a quid pro quo aimed at changing the classification of information in an email sent to the private server she used exclusively while secretary of State. In the campaign's final weeks, Trump's burn-down-the-house strategy is likely to have an impact that will be felt not only by President Hillary Clinton, if she wins, but also by a divided Republican Party. Regardless of Trump's own role down the road, if he loses the election, the discontent he has tapped more effectively than any other political figure this year isn't going away after the ballots are counted. "Trump has created a roiling force that will make national politics and policymaking an even bumpier ride than it has been in recent years," predicts Steven Schier, a political scientist at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., and co-author of Polarized: The Rise of Ideology in U.S. Politics. Trump's allegations of a fixed election, while not backed up by evidence, could raise questions among some about the legitimacy of Clinton's victory, just as his discredited suggestions that Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States raised questions. Trump's accusations of criminal misconduct by Clinton, which regularly sparks chants of "Lock Her Up!" at his rallies, could encourage Republicans to demand investigations of the new president. His hard line on immigration and trade could make it more difficult for GOP lawmakers to consider compromises that would help get legislation passed. And he has affected the political landscape itself. He has blurred the lines between politics and celebrity. He has crossed the traditional boundaries about what is appropriate to say and do in a political campaign. At the second debate, he invited several women who had accused former president Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct in the past. At the third one, he invited Patricia Smith, who blames Clinton for the death of her son during the 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. And, oddly, Malik Obama, the president's half-brother who has endorsed Trump. 
January 4, 2017	USA TODAY	President-elect Donald Trump, who made criticism of foreign trade deals a major theme of his presidential campaign, said Tuesday he is nominating former Reagan administration official Robert Lighthizer to be his new U.S. trade representative.  Lighthizer, 69, "has extensive experience striking agreements that protect some of the most important sectors of our economy and has repeatedly fought in the private sector to prevent bad deals from hurting Americans," Trump said in a statement. "He will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity." A critic of China trade practices in particular, Lighthizer said he is "fully committed to President-elect Trump's mission to level the playing field for American workers and forge better trade policies, which will benefit all Americans." In recent years, Lighthizer has worked on trade issues as a partner with the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Trump made the announcement while preparing for another day of briefings and jobs interviews at his Manhattan office tower. The president-elect also stayed busy on social media. In a flurry of new tweets, Trump: Questioned House Republicans for gutting a congressional ethics investigating committee, tweeting that the GOP should focus on issues like tax reform and health care; however, Trump also described the independent ethics committee's work as "unfair." Threatened General Motors -- and presumably other companies -- with the imposition of a "border tax" over operations in Mexico. Again pledged to dismantle President Obama's health care plan, saying it "just doesn't work, and it is not affordable." Later in the week, Trump plans to receive a special security briefing on allegations that Russia orchestrated the hacking of Democratic officials during last year's presidential election, aides said. Trump  is awaiting a final report being developed by intelligence agencies at Obama's request. Among the jobs he plans to fill in the coming days: director of National Intelligence, secretary of Agriculture and secretary of Veterans Affairs. 
March 28, 2016	USA TODAY	Donald Trump is mistaken to suggest that a president could easily force Apple to make iPhones in America by slapping tariffs on imports from China. But he is correct to raise the larger question of whether America could be manufacturing and exporting more than it does while importing less.  Take Intel's investment in a microprocessor chip factory in China. A very large portion of the chips that power the world's computers is made by Intel in the United States. Chip production is highly capital and technology intensive and not at all labor intensive, so cheap Chinese labor is not a reason for producing there. In terms of production costs and quality, the U.S. is quite competitive. Before Intel's facility in China started up, America had a large trade surplus with China in semiconductors largely due to the export of microprocessors. But China, like many other countries, aggressively promotes production in China, especially of high tech, high productivity items. As Intel's former CEO Paul Otellini has noted, because of Chinese tax breaks, infrastructure  and land contributions, Intel saves about $100 million a year in China vs. having the same facility in the U.S.  These microprocessor plants create lots of high paying jobs. Yet, while state governments have some incentive programs, the U.S. government does little even to keep track of, much less counter, other countries' incentives. Or look at exchange rates. Countries  from South Korea to Switzerland periodically buy or sell their own currencies in global markets to maintain an artificially low exchange rate with the dollar. This boosts their exports while reducing imports. The U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement of 2012 was supposed to reduce the U.S. bi-lateral trade deficit. By now, however, that deficit has grown by $13 billion in part due to Korean currency intervention. Yet, Washington has been loath to offset currency intervention and has never included effective currency provisions in any free trade deals. Clyde Prestowitz is president of the Economic Strategy Institute and a former trade negotiator for the Reagan administration. His most recent book is Japan Restored. 
April 1, 2016	USA TODAY	While making final preparations for his nuclear security summit, President Obama spent Thursday discussing challenges in Asia that span  North Korea's nuclear weapons to China's military and territorial ambitions.  Obama, who welcomed world leaders to the White House for a working dinner, held private meetings earlier in the day with the top officials from Japan, South Korea, and China, sessions devoted mainly to North Korea's nukes. "We continue to face the threat from North Korean provocations," said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. "We have to take necessary measures to protect ourselves and our allies." The president held a joint meeting in the morning with Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korea President Park Geun Hye. Though they are rivals on many issues, Abe and Park are more united over concerns about North Korea, which in recent months has conducted a fourth nuclear bomb test and launched a long-range rocket into space. Dan Kritenbrink, senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, said he expects Obama, Abe, and Park to "clearly demonstrate their unity in our commitment and our firm resolve to deter and defend against North Korean aggression." North Korea also topped the agenda when Obama met in the afternoon with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Rhodes noted that U.S. officials have long been talking with Chinese, Japanese, and South Korean officials about the threat posed by North Korea, and "we're in discussions about the deployment of additional missile defense" in the area. Obama and Xi also have other topics to discuss as well. They include Chinese military expansion into the South China Sea, which is creating friction with neighboring countries, and allegations that Chinese interests have hacked into U.S. computers. While the topic is not expected to surface in the Obama-Xi talks, China has also become an issue in the American presidential campaign to replace Obama. Republican front-runner Donald Trump says China is using trade rules to take jobs away from the U.S. China, Japan, and South Korea are key participants in the fourth bi-annual Nuclear Security Summit, an event Obama first organized in 2010. Thursday's working dinner at the White House precedes Friday plenary sessions devoted to reducing nuclear stockpiles, improving security at nuclear facilities and producing peaceful nuclear energy. 
July 20, 2016	USA TODAY	After delegates to the Republican National Convention officially selected Donald Trump and Mike Pence as their candidates Tuesday, they set their sights on Hillary Clinton amid excoriating speeches and cries of "Lock her up!"  Trump is scheduled to accept the nomination in a speech Thursday. He appeared on video high above the convention floor to thank the convention. "This is a movement, but we have to go all the way," he said. "We are going to win the presidency and bring real change and leadership back to Washington." Indiana Gov. Mike Pence was heralded by the state's lieutenant governor, Eric Holcolm, as "a great man of integrity, a proven conservative." It didn't take long for the ebullient mood to turn negative as a parade of speakers castigated Democrat Hillary Clinton over her e-mail controversy, the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, and even her treatment of women. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie listed what he called Clinton's crimes around the world, from Cuba to China, each time asking the crowd, "Guilty or not guilty?" Sharon Day, co-chair of the Republican National Committee,  targeted former president Bill Clinton's private life -- a theme likely to be repeated over the next couple of days. "As first lady, you viciously attacked women who were sexually abused at the hands of your husband," Day said. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who came late to the Trump bandwagon, sought to bring the party together with a more positive, policy-oriented message. "What do you say that we unify this party?" he said. "Let's get on the offensive, and let's stay there." Signs of continuing discord were evident off the convention floor. In the midst of the roll call, Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- who placed third in the nomination contest -- wasn't even in the hall. He was speaking to members of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. "In a political campaign, what you say should be what you mean," Kasich said, adding that Trump's convention "is not where I think I need to be." As soon as Trump tweeted about the roll call, Clinton's campaign responded by urging supporters to text, register and "make sure he never becomes president." Through the night, Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and vanquished presidential candidates Christie and Ben Carson were among those who urged a united effort to defeat Clinton, the leader in most national polls. 
January 23, 2017	USA TODAY	In a further sign of China attempting to burnish its globalist credentials, e-commerce giant Alibaba said Thursday it signed on as one of the lead sponsors of the Olympics through 2028. The announcement at the World Economic Forum was made during a news conference with International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, Alibaba founder Jack Ma and company CEO Daniel Zhang. While no figure was released and Zhang said the aim of the deal was not to be "just another sponsor but a partner" with the IOC, some estimates suggest the arrangement could be worth as much $600 million.  Ma said it was a "historical" day for Alibaba and that the initiative forms part of his ambition to steer the massive Chinese online shopping channel toward partnerships and deals that focus, through sports, on "happiness and health." "More people need to get involved with sports, and the Olympic spirit is about working together," Ma said. "This is a long-term commitment from us." The company will become part of The Olympic Partner (TOP) program, as well as the Game's official "Cloud Services" and "E-Commerce Platform Services" partner, and one of the founding partners of the Olympic Channel. In this capacity, it will help sell official Olympic merchandise worldwide. The new digital television service hopes to pull in younger fans who have not been as eager as previous generations to embrace the television model of the Games. "This is a new, game-changing immersive experience that we want to create together through digital technology," said Alibaba Chief Marketing Officer Chris Tung. Alibaba is one of China's most high-profile businesses, and Ma is a charismatic and maverick billionaire businessmen who has bridged a period of extraordinary change for China's global ambitions. He has a rags-to-riches story and founded the consumer-to-consumer and business-to-business online platform firm with a $60,000 loan from friends. The announcement comes as Alibaba extends its e-commerce reach to global markets and at a time when the next three Olympic Games will be held in Asia: the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, Korea; the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo; and the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing. It also comes as President Xi Jinping became this week the first Chinese leader to visit the annual gathering for business leaders and the international elite in the Swiss ski town of Davos. In a forceful and enigmatic speech laced with Chinese proverbs, Xi used a speech Tuesday to point out the wealth-creating merits of globalization and to push back against talk of protectionism that featured heavily in the campaign of President Donald Trump and in Britain's decision to vote to leave the European Union. "The world needs a new leadership, which is about working together. We don't necessarily need one specific leader to teach us what to do," Ma said in a panel discussion Wednesday, of the Chinese leader's speech. "I feel proud what of Xi said. I want the world to share in all the prosperity." Over the past few decades, China has rapidly developed into an economic super-power and international trade has boomed. With the deal, Alibaba becomes the International Olympic Committee's main e-commerce platform. It will also help customize the Olympic Channel for a Chinese audience. Bach said the deal reflected the IOC's efforts to help motivate people to play more sports and "get the couch potatoes off the couch." He said the concept of globalization existed in sports, especially in the Olympics, years before it existed in business. The International Olympic Committee is embracing the digital revolution, said IOC director of marketing Timo Lumme. "We need strong digital partners and there is no stronger partner in this than Alibaba." Alibaba joins such global brands as Coca-Cola, McDonald,  Samsung, Panasonic and General Electric. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, TOP sponsorships were estimated to cost as much as $200 million, according to Forbes. 
July 19, 2016	USA TODAY	Perhaps nowhere has the Republican Party's accommodation of Donald Trump been more awkward and more shameless than on the issue of trade. Over the weekend, Trump again denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement as "the worst economic deal in the history of our country" and "a horror show" -- all while introducing his NAFTA-backing running mate, Mike Pence. And on Monday, the GOP convention in Cleveland approved a platform that reads like a criminal indictment of China's economic practices and is considerably more hostile to trade than the one adopted four years ago.  Republican leaders in Congress have already given up on scheduling a vote this year on the 12-nation trade pact known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which excludes China and would help American movie makers, software designers, drug companies and other industries that benefit from international commerce. The party platform says TPP approval shouldn't be rushed or undertaken in a lame duck Congress. Such a message no doubt goes down well in hard-hit Rust Belt communities where the presidential election will be contested. In recent decades, certain manufacturing industries, such as textiles, have contracted severely, and most government programs to retrain displaced workers have been a shambles. Even so, a message that focuses only on the casualties of trade is misleading and manipulative. It is a bad idea for a party that has long branded itself as the party of free enterprise. It is even worse news for the nation as a whole. Trade is a major force behind innovation and improvements in quality that help keep the American economy on its toes. Without competition from Japan, Detroit would probably still be making the shoddy cars that were its hallmark in the 1970s. And without the ability to sell globally, companies such as Apple, Facebook and Google would probably not be the iconic brands they are today. Trade gets a bad rap -- from progressive Democrats as well Trump backers -- because its benefits are taken for granted, its beneficiaries are hard to identify and organize, and its victims are readily recognizable when a plant closes. But its upsides include lower costs and more choices for consumers, and thriving exports in agriculture, technology, health care, financial services and even many areas of manufacturing. A strong case can be made that technology, and not trade, is the major disruptive force (for good and bad) in employment. This can be seen in the fact that manufacturing output has continued to grow even as 5 million manufacturing jobs have been eliminated since 2000. It can also be seen in the declines in employment in retail, travel, media and other industries not impacted by trade. Yet, to hear Trump talk, one would think that China, Mexico and a few other countries are responsible for all disruptions in the workforce, and that Americans get nothing out of trade. If the GOP seeks a vibrant future -- for itself and for the U.S. economy -- it will turn away from Trump's defeatist trade policies. 
January 24, 2017	USA TODAY	The Trans-Pacific Partnership was pitched as fuel for American exporters in their global competition. President Trump, by signing an executive order Monday to abandon the TPP, demonstrated that his priority is to slow the tide of jobs leaving the United States and experiment with other protectionist measures before providing a leg-up to American companies seeking cheaper labor abroad. The order on his first working day as president reverses decades of pro-trade policies pursued by his predecessors, who argued such deals boost U.S. exports, open markets for American companies and lead to more jobs.  Trump argues these trade deals are costing U.S. workers their jobs, and that the TPP is filled with too many concessions to other nations The TPP is a trade pact among 12 Pacific Rim countries, excluding China, that was signed last year by President Obama after seven years of negotiation. But the Senate had not yet ratified it. The 30-chapter pact, which also needed to be ratified by other countries before Trump's order Monday, aims to boost exports, remove tariffs, open access to more markets and usher in transparency in trade rules. Other countries part of the TPP are Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Vietnam, Chile, Brunei, Singapore and New Zealand. The pact "levels the playing field by setting the highest enforceable standards and by removing barriers to selling our goods overseas," Obama wrote last year in an editorial for The Washington Post. A key selling pitch by Obama was that agreement would remove more than 18,000 tariffs that have hampered U.S. companies from selling their products in foreign countries. The TPP also includes rules about environmental standards, labor practices, the influence of state-owned enterprises, trade disputes, e-commerce policies, intellectual property protection and anti-corruption measures. Labor unions that oppose the deal are primarily concerned that the TPP inhibits domestic investment, particularly in manufacturing, by offering benefits to U.S. companies that relocate operations and jobs abroad. They say it also loosens restrictions on foreign companies that export to the United States, hurting domestic competitors. For example, the agreement with South Korea requires that only 35% of the parts of products coming into the U.S. duty-free originate in Korea, which means the majority of parts could come from China or other places, according to the Communications Workers of America. The TPP could be used as a "backdoor" for Chinese products to come into the U.S. duty-free and hurt domestic competitors, it said. About 448,000 U.S. jobs could be lost if the TPP were enacted, according to a study by Tufts University's Global Development And Environment Institute. Critics also say the TPP would be the latest in a string of failed trade policies that have contributed to wage stagnation in the U.S. Working-class Americans already lose about $1,800 annually because wages have been depressed by companies choosing to operate in countries with lower wages, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. "It's a race to the bottom on wages," said Robert E. Scott, senior economist for the Economic Policy Institute. Obama has countered that the TPP offers benefits that would touch many sectors of the U.S. economy. "Building walls to isolate ourselves from the global economy would only isolate us from the incredible opportunities it provides," he said. Jeffrey Frankel, professor of capital formation and growth at Harvard Kennedy School, said in an editorial for The Boston Globe that the TPP reduces tariffs and quotas. "It is true that the United States will not be lowering many such import barriers under TPP because we don't have many," he said. "But other members around the Pacific Rim have lots. TPP will lower their trade barriers." In a report last year, the U.S. International Trade Commission, a non-partisan federal agency, had a more optimistic outlook, saying the agreement would result in a net increase of 128,000 full-time jobs in 15 years. But the agency estimated that the TTP would boost U.S. gross domestic product only by a modest 0.15%, or $42.7billion, by 2032. Output in manufacturing, natural resources, and energy would drop of 0.1%, with the TPP agreement in place, the agency predicted. In 15 years, output would grow 0.5% in the agriculture industry and 0.1% in the services sector, the ITC said. The ITC concluded that the TPP would contribute to modest growth in American companies' business abroad. U.S. exports and U.S. imports are projected to grow by 1% and 1.1%, respectively, in 15 years as a result of the TPP. The ITC said some details of the agreement -- such as rules for protecting data flows and establishing standards for customs, sanitary conditions and intellectual property rights -- would be more difficult to quantify but be just as beneficial to U.S. exporters. "TPP would generally establish trade-related disciplines that strengthen and harmonize regulations, increase certainty, and decrease trade costs for firms that trade and invest in the TPP region," the ITC said.
March 4, 2016	USA TODAY	The presidential election is eight months away, but "political risk" is already being felt on Wall Street as money and politics collide in a flurry of often "polarizing and populist" campaign sound bites that investors fear could weigh on the economy, financial markets and global trade.  "Is political risk on the rise? Yes," says Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott: "The polarizing, populist rhetoric pointing at select industries, trade and tax policy is an influencing factor in the market's volatility." Wall Street loves certainty. But the 2016 race for the White House is all about uncertainty with no shortage of unknowns and potential plot twists. Indeed, handicapping this year's circus-like presidential race and its impact on markets has become increasingly difficult. One wild card is Donald Trump, the real estate investor best known for his stint on the reality TV show The Apprentice, who has climbed to the top spot in the Republican race despite wobbly support from his own party and withering criticism Thursday from 2012 GOP candidate Mitt Romney. Trump's rise "magnifies the uncertainty," Luschini says, due in large part to Trump's anti-establishment, unpredictable, "unconventional ... and unscripted" campaign. While Trump's plan to lower tax rates for individuals, investors and corporations is viewed as growth-friendly, many of Trump's other campaign comments are "protectionist" in nature, which worries free-trade advocates, Wall Street pros say. Trump says he will build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico to impede illegal immigration. He branded China a "currency manipulator." And he's issued unkind words about U.S. companies that set up shop overseas to reduce their tax bills or gain other competitive advantages. "He's perceived as a populist and nationalist who will reverse the course of globalization," says Nick Sargen, senior investment adviser at Fort Washington Investment Advisors. "The possibility of a Trump presidency could cause a stir abroad and possible selling of U.S. securities." Democratic front-runner and establishment candidate Hillary Clinton also gives some Wall Streeters pause. Clinton has been a vocal critic of the pharmaceutical industry for charging exorbitant prices for prescription drugs, raising fears of drug-price controls. The former first lady and secretary of State is also a proponent of making the banking sector less risky and has proposed levying a "risk fee" on banks, imposing a tax on high-frequency trading firms and holding financial employees and executives accountable when they break the law, according to her campaign website. Clinton, however, is less of a wild card than Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders, says Michael Farr, president of money-management firm Farr, Miller & Washington. This year's presidential campaign is a choice between "establishment" candidates and "anti-establishment" hopefuls, says Erik Davidson, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank. "The establishment candidates represent some level of certainty," he says. "At least you know what you will be getting." 
November 29, 2016	USA TODAY	For the past year, the tech industry shunned Donald Trump, and he shamed it. Now, the president-elect and the $2.9 trillion sector find themselves thrust into a shotgun marriage. "Much of the business is in a wait-and-see mode," says Meg Whitman, CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, one of the largest tech companies in the world and a Hillary Clinton supporter. "We adapt and make the most of the situation." Many in tech supported Clinton, and they expected her to win. With Trump as president-elect, they are hastily revising plans.  One difficulty: Trump has no discernible tech plan nor has he openly courted tech executives. For those in Silicon Valley and beyond, he is the great unknown, and his potential Cabinet is creating fears of restrictions on skilled immigrant workers, weakened cybersecurity, punishing tariffs on products made in China and unrelenting pressure to bring  manufacturing jobs to the U.S. "Most of the planning (by tech companies) had been done under the assumption that Hillary would win," says Deven Parekh, managing director at Insight Venture Partners. "There was a big transition team for her ready to go, which included technology-related issues." It has made for an uneasy climate, but tech executives and trade associations say they've accepted the election results and want to work with Team Trump. Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, voted for Clinton after supporting Republican candidates in the last four presidential elections. He welcomes working with the Trump administration but doesn't know what to expect. "We reached out to Trump and Clinton, and we didn't get a response from him. Am I concerned? Of course I'm concerned," says Shapiro, whose trade organization represents more than 2,200 companies, including Amazon, Uber and Apple. Still, there is overlap between Silicon Valley and Trump's transition team, with its ties to real estate, venture funding and other businesses. A main connector? Peter Thiel. The influential venture capitalist and Facebook board member donated $1.25 million to Trump's campaign. He was a delegate for Trump and spoke at the Republican National Convention. Thiel doesn't have a formal role during the transition but has spent nearly two weeks advising the Trump team. The investor isn't the valley's only link to Trump, but he appears to be its strongest one. Joe Lonsdale, founding partner at 8VC, a Silicon Valley-based tech investment fund, has his own connections to the Trump camp as well as strong ties to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Driving tech executives to find a receptive ear in the Trump administration is a platform that was generally unfriendly to the tech industry. Trump's populist message of restrictive immigration, manufacturing in America, privacy and hard-line stance on trade agreements is of paramount concern. Conversely, his views on reduced taxation and regulation could benefit an industry with which he is a stranger. "Absent a tech plan, we need to look at his stances on immigration, taxation and privacy and extrapolate how it applies to tech," says Lee Tien, senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "That's a risky proposition." Along his improbable journey, Trump has blasted Amazon for not paying enough taxes and a surrogate of his skewered Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for perceived anti-Trump comments. Apple, in particular, could be in the crosshairs of a Trump administration. Over the past year, Trump has chastised Apple and other hardware makers to build more products in the U.S. instead of China. As a candidate, he demanded a boycott of Apple when it didn't cave to the FBI's request to hack the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters. Or, as has been the case with Trump the candidate vs. Trump the president-elect, was it just posturing in a pre-emptive negotiating tactic? Trump said Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates called him after his election but declined to say what they talked about, according to a meeting he had with The New York Times last week. The underlying contempt for elitism, as personified by West Coast-based companies with high-intellect founders and socially conscious CEOs, was articulated by White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. "The globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia. The issue now is about Americans looking to not get (expletive) over. If we deliver," Bannon said. "That's what the Democrats missed. They were talking to these people with companies with a $9 billion market cap employing nine people. It's not reality. They lost sight of what the world is about." The thinly-veiled swipe at unicorns offers another layer of uncertainty in Silicon Valley, tech pockets throughout the U.S. and the Beltway. "He's spent a lot of time on Twitter but hasn't said much about tech during the campaign," says Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., a former Microsoft executive. "We need a conversation about tech and government's use of tech. It won't happen without input from the tech community." DelBene, who has worked closely with Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., another tech alumnus, is hopeful the new administration does not derail progress on bipartisan tech issues such as privacy and the Internet of Things. The concern is palpable from an industry that has felt the wrath of Trump's tweets and unpredictability.. ITI CEO Dean Garfield, whose organization represents more than 60 tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft and Facebook, is optimistic about Trump's vow to invest up to $1 trillion into infrastructure. It could be a boon for Internet of Things devices such as sensors for roadways that enable driverless cars to interact and communicate. A much-rumored bipartisan infrastructure plan that could bring jobs to the Rust Belt might involve tech companies, Garfield and Shapiro say. Last year, Speaker Ryan supported an infrastructure plan by Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) in which hundreds of billions of dollars would be raised through a one-time "repatriation" of profits from big companies' overseas earnings in exchange for lower tax rates.
September 27, 2016	USA TODAY	Provocative Trump, who unexpectedly claimed the Republican presidential nomination over a dozen rivals with stronger political résumés? Or Presidential Trump, who in recent weeks has toned down his rhetoric and, in another political surprise, managed to pull even with rival Hillary Clinton in national and battleground polls? In response to the opening question from the moderator, NBC's Lester Holt, Trump delivered his signature, dire view of the state of the nation. "We have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us," he said, denouncing the threat from Mexico and China and elsewhere. "We have to stop our jobs from leaving the United States and with it firing all our people." Clinton's response to the first question reflected her own signature style as well, cramming a dozen bullet-point policy proposals into a two-minute answer, from infrastructure investment and a higher minimum wage to equal pay for women and debt-free college. Then, despite all the speculation beforehand that she would try to come across as more likeable, she chose to be a counter-puncher. That said, her response to him seemed marked more by amusement than anger, and she made a point of smiling. They jabbed each other in the fiercest and most personal series of exchanges in a presidential debate in modern times. He portrayed her as one of the political hacks who has led the nation dangerously astray. "It's all words, it's all sound bites," he said dismissively, repeatedly interrupting her and at times audibly snorting as she spoke. She portrayed him as a questionable businessman with few specific plans and a limited grasp of the facts, advocating economic policies she repeatedly dubbed "Trumped-up trickle-down." She accused him of racist behavior in questioning President Obama's birthplace and questioned what he was trying to hide by refusing to release his tax returns while they are being audited. The setting inside the debate hall at Hofstra University looked dignified enough to fit in the White House itself, with a dark blue backdrop, a discrete band of white stars and a depiction of a golden eagle soaring over the two contenders. But the mood surrounding the opening forum was almost gladitorial. No presidential election in modern times has defied the conventional wisdom as much as this one, which has ended up pitting a political neophyte and reality-TV star against the wife of a former president, a member of the family that defines the Democratic establishment. And no presidential debate in the television age has been more hotly anticipated. A few hours before the debate, Trump was needling Clinton on Twitter, a platform he has perfected as a political weapon. "My team of deplorables will be managing my Twitter account for this evenings debate," he wrote, a reference to her description at a fundraiser of his followers as a "basket of Deplorables." History demonstrates that the opening debate can be powerful enough to boost a candidate or wound one, with lasting consequences. Eleven campaigns have included debates in the television age. In nine of them, it shaped the trajectory of the campaign that followed in fundamental ways. The first debate helped elect John Kennedy in 1960 and Ronald Reagan in 1980. It helped defeat Michael Dukakis in 1988 and Al Gore in 2000. They typically have had the most impact when an incumbent president isn't running, and when the candidates come in with something to prove, and when the contest is close and fluid. That is, in a campaign like this one. 
November 3, 2016	USA TODAY	With just days until the presidential election, Wall Street remains on high alert. Investors are in risk-watch mode thanks to a bitter campaign punctuated by narrowing polls, candidates with low likability ratings and unexpected bombshells like claims of Donald Trump groping women and the FBI's ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. It would be a big surprise, one few investors saw coming. Even Trump says if he pulls off the upset it would equate to "Brexit times 10," or way bigger than the shock waves the United Kingdom sent through markets in June when it voted to exit the European Union. Stocks will likely sell off if Trump triumphs. Barclays says the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index has downside risk of 11% to 13% if the billionaire businessman wins. Declines could be as big as "10% to 15%," according to a  paper by University of Michigan's Justin Wolfers, Dartmouth's Eric Zitzewitz and the National Bureau of Economic Research. And don't rule out a bear market if Clinton loses, warns Don Luskin, chief investment officer at financial research firm TrendMacro. "If Trump wins ... stocks will drop at least 20% just like that," Luskin told USA TODAY. "Because markets hate to be surprised and hate it when the conventional wisdom is dead wrong. Just look at the reaction to Brexit." Why are investors so averse to Trump? Too many unknowns and too little political experience, says Thomas Block, Washington policy strategist at FundStrat Global Advisors. "I don't see how investors can envision what his administration would look like," Block told USA TODAY. "Plus I don't see his harsh rhetoric and take-no-prisoners negotiating style working with strong-willed legislators. Relations with allies in Europe and Asia could seriously deteriorate, and China, with its large U.S. Treasury holdings, would be very anxious." Financial pain would also likely be felt if Clinton takes the White House and Democrats retake control of the Senate and House of Representatives, although odds still favor the GOP holding the House. "A Democratic sweep is a tail risk," says Andy Laperriere, head of U.S. Policy Research for Cornerstone Macro. An election hat trick would enable Democrats to take fuller control of the legislative process, making it easier for Clinton to push through her less business-friendly platform of higher taxes on the rich and investors, more regulation of businesses and spending programs. Wall Street prefers  political "gridlock" where legislative decisions related to trade, immigration, taxes, health care and regulation are made with input from both  parties. "A split chamber probably delivers the gridlock the market prefers," says Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist for Janney. Since World War II stocks have risen 2%, on average, from Election Day until year-end, thanks to the lifting of  uncertainty, according to CFRA, an independent stock and fund research firm. But what happens if uncertainty doesn't lift once the votes are counted? Or if violence breaks out, as 51% of voters fear, according to a recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll? How would investors react if Clinton wins but her legal troubles related to use of a personal email server while secretary of State worsen and spark a post-election crisis? What if Trump wins and the more than six dozen pending lawsuits now open against him and his company are tried while he's president, or if his controversial policies on trade and immigration get fast-tracked, or his claims of a rigged election gain traction? "Consumer confidence often increases after a presidential election, but perhaps not this time since both candidates are viewed as so flawed and unlikable," says Gregory Valliere, chief strategist at Horizon Investments. "If Trump (loses and) proclaims the election is rigged, perhaps a quarter of all Americans may agree with him. That's hardly a prescription for higher consumer confidence." Violence in the aftermath of the election, if it occurs, is viewed as a short-term hiccup. "If it (violence) was widespread and had economic consequences, such as consumers staying home and not spending, it could (impact markets)," Luschini says. Adds Luskin: "Markets are not typically rattled by violence in the streets. Remember 1968 -- riots, assassinations, shootings all over the world -- stocks just went higher and higher, through it all." 
January 18, 2017	USA TODAY	After Donald Trump's inauguration, his wife, Melania, will return home to their gilded penthouse in New York -- leaving much of the work traditionally associated with the unpaid and often thankless role of first lady to her stepdaughter Ivanka. Of course, the full-time non-job of chief hostess and domestic diplomat has been evolving ever since Martha Washington held it. She complained in a letter to her niece that "I think I am more like a state prisoner than anything else, there is certain bounds set for me which I must not depart from."  Asked during a joint appearance with Laura Bush in Tanzania whether she ever felt that way, Michelle Obama answered that though the "best job in the world" does have "prison elements,'' she had nothing to complain about. Do I have to remind you of the outraged headlines that followed? Breitbart's was "White House 'prison': The Obamas love the perks, hate the office." It's not hard to understand why Mrs. Trump might want to minimize our opportunities to analyze her hairstyle and travel at taxpayer expense, and whether any down-market shopping trips are for real or for show. It's not unprecedented for a first daughter to act as first lady, either: The daughters of Thomas Jefferson and John Tyler, Andrew Jackson's niece and Martin Van Buren's daughter-in-law all did so for widowed presidents. Zachary Taylor's daughter filled in for her ailing mother, and James Buchanan's niece did the honors for her bachelor uncle. The public role of first lady has expanded considerably, though. And one of its chief functions has always been to divert and absorb some of the criticism that might otherwise accrue to the president. Much of the disparagement has been monumentally unfair. London-born Louisa Adams, John Quincy Adams' wife, was derided for having an English mother. Andrew Jackson's wife, Rachel, whom he felt had been hounded to her death just before his inauguration, was briefly a bigamist, yes, but she hadn't known her ex hadn't gone through with their divorce. Mary Todd Lincoln may have been a one-woman economic stimulus program, but she did not deserve to be accused of treason, or committed to an asylum by her only surviving child. Eleanor Roosevelt was hated for her activism, and Mamie Eisenhower was considered too inactive. Admired as Jackie Kennedy was, the same clothes that made her a fashion icon also got her painted as a spendthrift. Nancy Reagan was dubbed "Queen Nancy" for loving couture, buying White House china, and other perceived sins that were only forgiven after she sang about them self-deprecatingly at a press dinner. When Hillary Clinton was first lady, both she and her husband were effectively accused of being serial killers. The surprise is not that Melania Trump seems to be able to resist the allure of life in the White House, but that the de facto retirement of the role as we've known it has occasioned little conversation beyond the initial sniping about her decision to let her son finish the year in his school in Manhattan. Doubtless that's at least in part because her husband's critics are already fully employed. Amid worries about his potential conflicts of interest and admiration for Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, it's hard to get too excited about her whereabouts. Whatever the reason, I'm glad Melania Trump has been able to signal she'll stay off the public stage more than on it without exciting too much pushback. (And if putting your son's welfare first isn't a good reason, then what was the feminist movement about?) Moreover, I'm glad that she's retiring the role itself, for now anyway. Michelle Obama certainly served admirably, focusing on what you'd think would have been the wildly uncontroversial issues of military families and proper nutrition. But the same cannot be said of her detractors, whose repeated racist potshots only made her "when they go low, we go high" response all the more impressive. This is certainly not the reimagining of the job expected by those who were hoping to see Bill Clinton serving as "first gentleman." But when, not if, a woman is elected president, her spouse will be able to thank all his predecessors for showing the many different ways his job can be done. And Mrs. Trump for showing that it doesn't have to be done at all. Melinda Henneberger, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, joins The Kansas City Star editorial board Monday. 
September 9, 2016	USA TODAY	Controversial director Oliver Stone gives bad reviews to both major presidential candidates, saying Democrat Hillary Clinton "scares me" because of her hard-line foreign policies, and Republican Donald Trump is "too erratic" for the Oval Office.  Stone faulted Clinton and Trump for ignoring  issues such as the government's cyberwarfare and surveillance capabilities, the focus of his new movie, Snowden. The biopic, out Sept. 16, is the chronicle of National Security Agency whistle-blower Edward Snowden, the contractor who lives in Moscow after leaking classified documents in 2013 that revealed massive government surveillance of Americans as well as foreigners. "These candidates have not talked about cyberwarfare and Snowden. They are staying away from it," Stone said Thursday. "What kind of election is this? ... It's trivial, superficial." The Oscar-winning Stone, who made critically acclaimed box-office hits such as Wall Street and Platoon, has been at the center of numerous controversies over the story lines of his films on political subjects such as John F. Kennedy's assassination, Richard Nixon and George W. Bush. Handicapping the  election, Stone said, "I don't think Trump has a chance." The director said, "I will eat my hat -- I don't have a hat. I will eat my (expletive) shirt if he wins." Under a Clinton presidency, Stone said, "we're in for an even rockier road: more war, more violence, more death." Stone said he might vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein or Libertarian Gary Johnson. Stone  agreed with Trump that the NATO alliance should be re-examined now that its original enemy, the Soviet Union, no longer exists. Asked whether he has another political project in mind, Stone said with a laugh, "Make fun of Hillary Clinton. ... Trump is not as much a threat, but a good comedy on Hillary." Stone said he hopes Snowden will focus the public's attention on U.S. cyberwarfare programs that are  used as  weapons against countries around the world. The movie details the extent of U.S. covert activities in this field. In one scene, a cyberwarfare team in Hawaii accidentally causes a power blackout throughout Syria in 2012, but the United States blamed the outage on Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is fighting a rebellion. Stone said he talked to Snowden nine times to make sure the movie provided an accurate account of the classified programs Snowden had been assigned to or knew about. The director complained that the United States accuses  Russia, China and North Korea of hacking U.S.  computers but is mum about its own hacking. Americans need to re-examine government policies that have led to so many wars and own up to a troubled history, Stone said. In a twist on Trump's "Make America great again" slogan, he said, "We need to think about what we are. Let's make America honest again." 
November 10, 2016	USA TODAY	Donald Trump entered the 2016 presidential race as an underdog. His surprise victory over Hillary Clinton prompted foreign observers to say that their worst fears about the contentious U.S. election were realized.  "After Brexit and this election, anything is now possible. A world is crumbling before our eyes. Vertigo," France's ambassador to the United States, Gerard Araud, tweeted as it became clear that the billionaire businessman and reality TV star would win the world's most powerful post. Araud's reference to Britain's exit from the European Union -- the Brexit -- was a nod to another vote, also fought on a political battlefield that pitted the political establishment's support for open borders and global trade against strong populist support for nationalism and isolation. In both cases, voters upended pollsters' and pundits' predictions. "It's not just about him. It's about who he will, and has, emboldened," said Samantha Shannon, a popular British writer. "Everything about this feels identical to Brexit." Trump has touted a vision of a more isolationist American foreign policy that would represent a fundamental break with decades of internationalism. His proposals include making U.S. military support for NATO, a cornerstone of global security since World War II, conditioned on the financial support of the alliance's members. Chinese state media were quick to cast the election as the embodiment of America's democracy in crisis in contrast to China's perceived stability under authoritarian rule. "The majority of Americans are rebelling against the U.S.'s political class and financial elites," the official Communist Party newspaper People's Daily said in a commentary. In Russia, where the government has been accused by U.S. intelligence officials of trying to meddle in the election through cyber mischief, Muscovite Alexei Anatsky, who works in the IT industry, said, "Real life is turning out far less funny than it seemed a while ago. We had an idea of how people think in New York and San Francisco. Now we are seeing how more than half of the country thinks." Global markets expressed shock at Trump's win. Dow stock futures on Wall Street plunged more than 4% before recovering. In Tokyo, the Nikkei index nosedived 5.4%, its largest drop in years. European shares also plummeted. The Mexican peso started plunging as soon as it became clear that Trump had won the key battleground states of Florida, Ohio and North Carolina -- indicators of his eventual victory. Mexico's central bank had called a Trump win a possible "hurricane" for the peso and created a contingency plan to respond. Trump has referred to some Mexican migrants as rapists and criminals and vowed to build a wall along the U.S. border paid for by Mexico, a pledge that has angered many Mexicans.

November 10, 2016	USA TODAY	Donald Trump will get his chance to be  "the greatest jobs president that God ever created," as he promised during the campaign, but his  path to employment supremacy is shrouded in uncertainty.  The Republican real-estate baron and reality TV star's ascension to the White House caps a campaign that featured his pledge to spark a massive increase in employment and to lure manufacturing jobs back from overseas. He struck a chord with working-class white voters who flocked to the polls to back him. "Our thesis this year was, 'angry' is the new hope -- largely on the idea that the lack of economic growth was generating anger among the voters themselves," said Dan Clifton, head of policy research for market research firm Strategas. "What we're seeing is a great degree of political volatility that has stemmed from this economic volatility." Trump's promises to punish U.S. companies for outsourcing work, slap tariffs on certain foreign goods and renegotiate free-trade agreements were among his principal objectives. Whether those proposals will  spark job growth -- and whether they're achievable at all -- is debatable. Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said raising tariffs on imports from countries such as China and Japan could temporarily boost U.S. jobs. But in the long run, "are these policies going to frighten business leaders and investors about the wisdom of U.S. policymaking?" Burtless  asked in an interview. The best bet to spark quick job growth might be a bipartisan deal on infrastructure investment, Burtless said. That could include roads, bridges and water pipelines -- areas in which the presidential contenders shared some common ground. "We are currently in a phase where public investment in infrastructure has been declining," Burtless said. "If you think the country really does have a lot of underemployment, it does seem a strange time to scale back infrastructure." Trump's economic advisers floated a proposal last month that would provide tax credits to investors who acquire infrastructure bonds, arguing that $167billion in private investments could spark $1 trillion in infrastructure investment. But, "if he pays for this infrastructure boost by gutting spending elsewhere, he'll ruin the job creation impact," said Josh Bivens, director of research and policy for the Economic Policy Institute. One pragmatic way to fight back against globalization is to bolster education of highly skilled workers at home. The USA is trailing on that front. In India, growth in the number of people with "higher skills" is projected at 14.6% from 2015 through 2020, compared with 11.2% for the USA during that period, according to market research firm Euromonitor International. During the campaign, Trump decried the North American Free Trade Agreement that hastens economic activity between the USA, Mexico and Canada. He blasted companies such as Dearborn, Mich.-based automaker Ford Motor for launching plants in Mexico.
December 20, 2016	USA TODAY	No administration in history has been as fraught with financial conflicts of interest as the incoming Trump administration, from the president-elect on down. It is likely to be one of the most scandal-ridden in memory if these conflicts are not dealt with.  We have had wealthy presidents  and Cabinet officials before, but Donald Trump and his nominees shatter all records when it comes to scale of wealth, investments and potential conflicts. Most presidents' wealth was primarily domestic, and they created genuine blind trusts to manage their conflicts. Though no one knows for sure, because Trump refuses to release his tax returns, his vast empire is probably in the billions and spans the globe, with investments tracked so far in more than 20 countries. All these nations have a stake in U.S. foreign policy and would like to influence the U.S. worldview. China, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, Philippines, India, Turkey and others want something from America. Now they have a personal financial connection to the incoming president. Dozens of representatives from the ethics community have asked Trump to divest himself of  financial conflicts, especially  foreign investments, and move his wealth into a genuine blind trust run by an independent executor, not by his family. So far, he is sending opposite signals. The federal statute, which requires officials to avoid conflicts of interest, applies to everyone except the president and vice president. The Emoluments Clause of the Constitution is not quite so forgiving. The Founding Fathers feared foreign governments currying favor with officials by throwing gifts at their feet. They wrote right into the Constitution that officials cannot "accept of any present, emolument, office or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince or foreign state." Trump's Cabinet nominees bring their own weighty conflicts. Titans of industry will in some cases be taking over the very agencies that oversee their businesses.  They will be ripe for charges of self-dealing unless they take extraordinary precautions that go beyond the blind trust required by law. These precautions are already in place with President Obama's ethics Executive Order 13490. It requires all presidential appointees to sign an ethics pledge that they will recuse themselves from taking official actions that directly and substantially impact their former employers or clients of the last two years. The new president could extend Obama's rules for his own Cabinet officers. Trump has proposed  reasonable revolving-door restrictions on those who leave his administration. He must now do the same for those coming into it. That includes managing his own conflicts through divestiture and a genuine blind trust. Craig Holman, the government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen, has worked on President Obama's executive order on ethics and other revolving-door issues. 
January 18, 2017	USA TODAY	If elephants could trumpet for joy, there would have been a resounding crescendo Dec. 30 when China announced that it will close its domestic commercial ivory market this year. In 2015, Presidents Xi Jinping and Obama stood together and announced their intention to close their respective ivory markets. America implemented a near total ban last June.  Trade between countries is already prohibited, and now China's decision to cease domestic commercial ivory sales adds much needed teeth to that ban. Additionally, law enforcement efforts to stop the illegal trade will be enhanced along with public education on the ecological damage of purchasing ivory. Conservationists have called the Chinese ban a game changer, with ivory traffickers now staring at a giant "out of business" sign by their largest customer. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has voted  to urge all governments to close their domestic ivory markets. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) has adopted a resolution recommending the same. The seeds of this global movement began 28 years ago when, as secretary of State under President George H.W. Bush, I was proud to have been part of American leadership in an effort to ban the international ivory trade through CITES.  Elephant numbers, which had been declining steadily due to poaching, began to stabilize. Over time, however, the ban was weakened and undermined through approval of one-off sales of ivory stockpiles, as well as the development of a thriving black market trade. Coupled with growing wealth in China and the increased demand for luxury goods such as ivory, traffickers and organized crime networks began wholesale slaughtering of elephants. According to the Wildlife Conservation Society, this has resulted in as many as 35,000 elephants killed annually -- or 96 a day. A recent census puts the number of African elephants at 400,000, down from 1.2 million three decades ago. It's estimated that forest elephants, which are restricted to the Congo Basin in Central Africa, will need 100 years to recover from an onslaught of poaching that began in 2002. As China moves to implement its market closure, we need to ensure that  bans are policed effectively. Further, more resources are needed to stop the killings and put the traffickers out of business. Other countries with legal domestic ivory markets should follow China's lead and close their markets, particularly Japan and other Asian countries where demand for ivory is high. I applaud China and encourage it to strongly enforce its ban. And I urge the Trump administration to restore the bipartisan efforts and American leadership that will help elephant populations begin the long road to recovery.
April 28, 2016	USA TODAY	As anyone who watches reality television knows, the genre might be entertaining, but its correlation to actual reality is tenuous. Which is a good place to start with the much-awaited foreign policy speech delivered Wednesday in Washington by  candidate Donald Trump to burnish his presidential credentials.  As with The Apprentice, the show that helped him become a household name, the Republican front-runner sought to provide appealing fare for a certain demographic. In this case, the primary audience was voters opposed to trade, resentful of immigrants, distrustful of foreign governments and wistful for a time when America wielded more power in a simpler world. In reaching out to this group, Trump vividly portrayed a world that does not exist: America's allies would be more respectful after being lectured to, while its enemies would be dealt with by bluster. China would fall into line after enduring unspecified economic pressure. And troubled regions of the world would be stabilized through American disengagement. Inexplicably, Trump declared that "America First" would be "the overriding theme" of his administration's foreign policy. A non-interventionist approach might have its merits in certain situations. But the America First movement got its name espousing an isolationist approach at exactly the wrong moment, urging the United States to stay out of World War II as Adolf Hitler was rampaging through Europe. Trump's secondary audience was the foreign policy elite, the equivalent of TV critics. And the early reviews were harsh. On CNN, foreign policy experts Fareed Zakaria and David Rothkopf used the same word to describe the speech: incoherent. Fellow Republican Lindsey Graham tweeted, "Not sure who is advising Trump on foreign policy, but I can understand why he's not revealing their names." In Trump's worldview, things happen because he says they will. He made a number of proclamations to this effect. His unspecified plan to defeat the Islamic State terrorist group echoed Richard Nixon's secret plan in 1968 to win the Vietnam War. ISIL "will be gone if I'm elected president," Trump vowed, "And they'll be gone quickly. They will be gone very, very quickly."
October 20, 2016	USA TODAY	Donald Trump is ending his presidential bid the same way he began it: Defiant and provocative, breaking campaign norms and ignoring experts' advice -- and becoming the nation's first presidential nominee in memory to say he wouldn't necessarily accept the election returns on Nov. 8. At the third and final debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday, Trump ticked off a list of grievances: Voter fraud he claims could let millions of ineligible people cast ballots. Charges of sexual misconduct against him that he said were "probably" generated by opponent Hillary Clinton's campaign. A news media he labeled as corrupt. And the stunning suggestion that he just might not concede the election if he lost.  "I will look at it at the time," the Republican nominee told moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News. "I'll keep you in suspense." With charge and countercharge -- each accusing the other of being "unfit" for the White House -- it was the most brutal presidential debate of the television age. The candidates did not shake hands before the debate began or when it ended. At this point, winning the White House would require the billionaire businessman to stage the most dramatic political comeback in modern American history. Clinton's national lead is the largest any candidate has held in decades three weeks before Election Day. But his fierce new message -- that journalists and the political establishment are working in collusion against him to rig the election -- helps guarantee that his campaign will have a continuing impact even if Clinton prevails. In some ways, Trump is like a bull trying to make sure as many teacups as possible are shattered before he leaves the china shop. Indeed, he didn't seem to be making much of an effort during the debate to reach out to independents and other swing voters by adopting a more presidential mien or to reassure skeptical voters that he had the temperament for the job he seeks. "Such a nasty woman," he muttered while Clinton was speaking. Citing investigations into her use of a private email server when she was secretary of State, he called her a "liar" who "shouldn't be allowed" to run for president. He flatly denied allegations of aggressive sexual misconduct from about a dozen women who have come forward since the second debate. "It was lies and it was fiction," he said. "I think they want either fame or her campaign did it," pointing at Clinton. "Every time Donald doesn't think things are going in his direction, he claims everything is rigged against him," Clinton said. She said she was "appalled" by his unwillingness to promise to accept the election results: "He is denigrating; he's talking down our democracy." Of course, Clinton had her own difficulties. She was on the defensive over the WikiLeaks release of thousands of emails to and from John Podesta, now her campaign chairman, that among other things contain purported excerpts from cozy speeches she delivered to big bankers. She denied allegations that there had been conflicts in interest in fundraising by the Clinton Foundation while she was secretary of State. His burn-down-the-house strategy is designed to excite his core supporters and discourage Clinton's supporters from showing up to vote. It also is likely to have an impact after the election on a President Hillary Clinton, if she wins, and on a divided Republican Party. The discontent he has tapped more effectively than any other political figure this year, winning him the GOP nomination against the odds, isn't going away after the ballots are counted. Trump's allegations of a fixed election, while not backed by evidence, could raise questions among some about the legitimacy of Clinton's victory, just as his discredited suggestions that Barack Obama wasn't born in the U.S. raised questions. His accusations of criminal misconduct, which prompts chants of "Lock Her Up!" at his rallies, could encourage congressional Republicans to demand investigations of the new president. His hard line on immigration and trade could make it more difficult for GOP lawmakers to consider compromises that would help get legislation passed. He has changed the political landscape itself -- blurring the lines between politics and celebrity and crossing the boundaries about what is appropriate to say and do in a  campaign. "Trump has created a roiling force that will make national politics and policymaking an even bumpier ride than it has been in recent years," predicts Steven Schier, a political scientist at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., and co-author of Polarized: The Rise of Ideology in U.S. Politics. He calls it "a new populist movement that will vex the GOP and challenge Hillary Clinton throughout her first term, should she be elected." 
July 18, 2016	USA TODAY	The Republican and Democratic conventions the next two weeks are likely to highlight the sharply divergent economic visions of presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and prompt closer scrutiny of their plans.  At the Republican gathering in Cleveland this week, Trump is expected to lay out his swashbuckling blueprint for shaking up the status quo. The real estate mogul has advocated slashing both personal and business taxes, including for the wealthy, aggressively confronting China on trade, and repealing much of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Clinton is largely proposing to maintain and tweak the Obama administration's policies by raising taxes on the wealthy, investing in infrastructure, lifting the minimum wage and toughening financial reform. Here's a breakdown: Proposes streamlining the seven tax brackets into three, with the top rate falling to 25% from 39.6%. All Americans would pay less in taxes, with the lower-income owing nothing. But high-earning households, who tend to spend less of their savings, would derive the biggest benefits, according to the Tax Policy Center. Itemized deductions would be sharply curtailed. The corporate tax rate would fall to 15% from 35%, while the rate for smaller businesses that now pay the personal income tax rate would also drop to 15%. In exchange, most tax breaks would be scrapped. Companies that have stockpiled earnings overseas with their foreign units to avoid U.S. taxes would pay a one-time 10% tax, as well as taxes on future foreign profits. Impact: The lower rates for both households and companies initially would spur more consumer spending and business investment. And the decline in the corporate rate theoretically should make the U.S. more competitive with other countries, attracting multinationals and creating jobs. Moody's Analytics estimates the economy would grow 3.7% in 2017 under Trump's plan, vs. 3% under current law. But the overhaul would cut federal revenue by $9.5 trillion over 10 years, the TPC estimates. Trump has said the loss could be offset by closing tax loopholes, increased income in a more vibrant economy and eliminating government waste, fraud and abuse. But both Moody's and Oxford Economics say the bulk of the gap would have to be financed by more borrowing that swells the deficit. That would cause interest rates to spike, dampening borrowing by both households and businesses and triggering a recession. "That swamps any benefits you get from lower taxes," says Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi. Oxford estimates the economy would slide into recession in 2018, and 3 million fewer jobs would be created during his term compared to the status quo. Dan Mitchell, senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute, says the lower tax rates would be a boon for the economy and could be funded by eliminating some federal departments. Calls for raising taxes on high-income households, with nearly all of the increases borne by the top 1%, TPC estimates. Clinton hasn't yet echoed President Obama's call to trim the corporate tax rate to 28%, but Zandi believes she ultimately will adopt a similar plan, making the U.S. more competitive. Like Trump, Clinton intends to discourage the practice of merging with a foreign company to avoid U.S. taxes. Most of the company would have to be owned by foreign shareholders to get the tax benefit. Tax credits also would be offered to businesses that hire apprentices, share profits with employees or invest in communities that face manufacturing job losses. Impact: The tax proposals would increase federal revenue by $1.1 trillion over the next decade, the TPC says. The windfall would be spent on initiatives such as paid family leave, education and economic development. Zandi says the tax plan largely would be neutral for the economy. Oxford economist Gregory Daco says the spending programs would provide a modest boost to growth. Is taking a bareknuckled approach to the nation's massive trade deficit with China. He wants to declare China a currency manipulator because of its past efforts to push down the value of the yuan, bolstering its exports at the expense of U.S. shipments to China. He has threatened to slap a 45% tariff on Chinese imports and a 35% tariff on Mexican imports. He opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal with Pacific Rim countries, which Congress has not ratified. Impact: Such hefty duties would almost certainly trigger retaliation from China and Mexico, crimping exports to those countries and hurting U.S. economic growth, Zandi says. Trump has said he's aiming to bring thousands of manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. from China. But Zandi says it's unlikely companies will take such a step given the uncertainty of how long the tariffs would remain in place. And Daco says U.S. companies doing business in China would be unlikely to quickly shift to the U.S., where they'll have to pay significantly higher wages. Also, large tariffs would increase U.S. consumer prices by 3% within 18 months, Zandi says. Yet Trump has called his threats a negotiating strategy. And Cato's Mitchell says it could be effective if it works. Says she wants to crack down on Chinese currency manipulation, and her website says she'll "stand up to Chinese abuses." She has not been specific but says she'll triple the number of trade enforcement officers. She initially supported the Trans-Pacific trade deal but reversed herself during her campaign against Bernie Sanders. Impact: Would largely retain President Obama's open trade policies that have supported U.S. exports, Zandi says. Initially said he opposes a hike in the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage. Months later, he said he supports a higher pay floor for American workers but would prefer to leave it to the states. Supports a boost in the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour. Also says she'll encourage states and localities to go further. Impact: A Congressional Budget Office study in early 2014 found that increasing the federal minimum to $10.10 an hour within two years would lift 900,000 people out of poverty but result in 500,000 fewer jobs. Daco, however, says that if the increase is implemented gradually, it would just modestly temper hiring while boosting consumer spending. Doesn't have a specific proposal but says he has discussed a "trillion-dollar rebuilding plan" to revamp the nation's crumbling highways, bridges, airports and waterways, according to New York magazine. Impact: Trump says the initiative would create 13 million jobs, in line with the jobs candidate Bernie Sanders said his $1trillion infrastructure plan would generate. Each dollar invested in infrastructure bolsters productivity and increases gross domestic product by about $1.23 a year later, Moody's says. The question is how Trump would pay for the program while cutting more than $9 trillion in tax revenue. Wants to spend $275 billion over the next five years and create a $25 billion infrastructure bank to support projects. Would fund the plan by closing corporate tax loopholes. Says he would dismantle most of the 2010 law passed in the wake of the financial crisis. It created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and requires large banks to keep more capital buffers, among other things. He has said it has restricted bank lending. Impact: Modification of targeted provisions in the law could bolster economic growth, Daco says. But a wholesale repeal would wreak havoc for banks, which have spent millions to implement it, Zandi says. Would defend the law and expand it by imposing a "risk fee" on the largest banks, toughen a rule that bars them from making risky trades with their own accounts and tax high-frequency trading. Impact: Additional constraints on financial firms could have a small negative effect on the economy, Daco says, while further reducing the odds of another crisis. 
November 14, 2016	USA TODAY	President Obama began his presidency with a series of foreign trips that critics derided as an "apology tour." Now, just a week after voters repudiated that presidency by turning the White House over to a bitter rival, Obama departs for what might be described as a humility tour. His visits to Greece, Germany and Peru this week will deal with a wide range of American issues abroad -- all of them cast in a new light by one big development back home: the election of Donald Trump.  "Of course, the Europeans are all mouths agape. 'How did this happen? What does it mean?'" said Kurt Volker, the former U.S. permanent representative to NATO in the Bush and Obama administrations who spent election night in Berlin. When Obama was the president-elect, he often reminded people that the United States only has "one president at a time." And while White House aides say he'll be "running through the tape" until Jan. 20, they also acknowledged that Trump's election looms over the agenda. "Look, we certainly expect that the election will be the primary topic on people's minds everywhere we go," said deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes. One of the most important, he said, is the NATO alliance itself.  Trump has said he would reconsider the alliance if other member countries don't pay their share of common defense expenditures, 2% of gross domestic product. Only five countries -- the United States, Greece, the United Kingdom, Estonia and Poland -- meet that benchmark. "On both sides of the Atlantic, we face the task of ensuring that our political institutions and economic policies are responsive to our people, many of whom feel that they have been hurt by globalization and trade," Obama said in an interview published Sunday in the Athens newspaper I Kathimerini. "My message -- especially with my visit coming so soon after a hard-fought election campaign in the United States -- will be that as our nations confront these challenges together, Americans continue to place enormous importance on our alliance with Greece." Obama's week-long foreign trip -- the last one scheduled before he leaves office -- will stop in three cities: Athens.  Obama will express support for Greece's economic reforms in the wake of the euro debt crisis as he meets with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras  on Tuesday. But the highlight of the visit is a speech on globalization -- a speech that was planned before the election result, but will take on new resonance after Trump's victory. "That will include, frankly, acknowledgment  of our election results, the Brexit election results," said Rhodes, Obama's chief foreign policy speechwriter. Berlin. Obama's trip to Hanover  in April was supposed to be his last visit to Germany. So the addition of one  final trip -- his sixth overall, more than any country except France -- underscores the  importance of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Obama will meet with Merkel Thursday and hold a joint press conference followed by a private dinner. The leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain  also will travel to Berlin for meetings Friday on the Islamic State, Europe's migration issues, Syria and Ukraine. Lima, Peru. The European legs were relatively late additions to the  schedule, and were planned around the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. Obama will meet with the 21 APEC countries on Sunday,  and a smaller group of 12 nations who signed on to the Trans-Pacific Partnership Saturday. White House aides said they understand  Trump's election has changed the equation on U.S. ratification of the deal. "But we continue to think that these types of deals make sense, simply because countries like China are not going to stop working on regional agreements," said deputy national security adviser Wally Adeyemo. Obama  also will hold a town hall for young leaders, and meet separately with Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Australian  Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. 
November 22, 2016	USA TODAY	The Chevrolet Bolt EV, Tesla Model 3 and electric vehicles in general face a radically new regulatory and political playing field as a professed climate change skeptic prepares to occupy the White House. The budding Trump administration so far has been short on policy specifics. But just two days after the election, automakers' chief lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, urged the Trump transition team to revise not only the fuel economy standards, but also the Obama administration's autonomous vehicle standards, on the grounds that they could cost its member companies billions of dollars. "The short answer is that we don't know what will happen with the Trump administration and electric vehicles," said Dave Reichmuth, senior engineer for the Union of Concerned Scientists clean vehicles program. "It might be awhile before we understand the policy priorities for the new administration."  Reichmuth points out that the EV tax credit is embedded in the larger federal tax code, so removing it would require action from Congress. So it's not likely to be changed soon, even if that was the direction that was chosen. It's worth noting that many of the cars receiving the credit come from U.S. assembly lines -- Tesla in Fremont, Calif., the Volt and Bolt in the Detroit area  and the Nissan Leaf in Smyrna, Tenn. None of this will shake automakers' resolve to advertise and sell these plug-in vehicles. The Bolt EV comes off a week when it won two Car of the Year awards, one from Motor Trend, the second from Green Car Journal. Its certified 238-mile range on a full charge should ease consumers' anxiety about being stranded. The Bolt comes to market, beginning in California, at least one year ahead of the Tesla Model 3. Both are in the same price range -- about $30,000 or slightly less after the $7,500 federal tax credit. "We have six now, and four are already sold. Mid-December is the target week for when we get any more," said Brian Satterlund, new car sales manager at Ron Tonkin Chevrolet in Portland, Ore., which has more public charging stations per capita than any U.S. city. About 1,100 miles south in Redwood City, Calif., about 40 customers have preordered Bolts, according to Michael Little, a sales consultant at Boardwalk Chevrolet. "Those people have paid a $1,000 deposit that holds your place in line," Little said. "We're expecting to receive 39 Bolts the week of Nov. 28 and another 14 on Dec. 12." California alone accounted for 54.5%, or 62,119, of the plug-in electric vehicles sold in 2015, according to hybridcars.com. The nation's largest state also has its own EV tax credits -- $2,500 for battery electrics and $1,500 for plug-in hybrids. Dan Sperling, founding director of the University of California-Davis Institute for Transportation Studies, said the industry's letter to the Trump transition team should not be interpreted as a plea to drop emission or fuel economy standards altogether. These are global companies, and China and Europe are moving forward with their incentives for non-gas-burning vehicles. Whatever the Trump administration does, the rest of the world won't abandon the Paris Agreement to reduce the global growth of carbon emissions. "The industry has made a massive investment in electric vehicles," Sperling said. "While some would prefer to slow it down, most companies are going to continue along that path." 
December 7, 2016	USA TODAY	In 2009, President Obama raised tariffs on car tires made in China, charging that domestic competitors were hurt by imports. Ranging from 25% to 35% for a period of three years, the tariffs saved about 1,200 jobs, according to an analysis by the Peterson Institute. But there were consequences. Tire prices rose in the U.S. And with Americans paying more for tires, spending on other retail goods fell, ultimately costing the U.S. economy around 2,531 jobs, the institute estimates.  In addition to questioning the legality and feasibility of trade policy that Donald Trump has tweeted in recent days, experts in the field and economists also warn of negative spillover from the president-elect's threats on Twitter to impose a 35% tariff on U.S. companies shipping jobs abroad. The potential fallout, they say, could include legal battles, higher prices for U.S. consumers and pushing the U.S. into a recession. Specifically, the president-elect said Sunday that the tax would be levied on the goods of American companies closing U.S. factories to ship jobs abroad. "Any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. without retribution or consequence, is wrong," he wrote in a series of tweets. "There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies." A unilateral move by the president to impose taxes on a specific company is unheard of, if not illegal. And tariffs could trigger  consequences far beyond envisioned at the onset. While he's seemingly referring to American companies, it is also unclear if the restriction he calls for refers only to those contemplating closing current domestic factories or generally discouraging manufacturing abroad. Trump made no distinction among large companies with their own factories or those who outsource assembly to foreign partners. "I think this is more an idle threat rather than a viable policy option," says Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. "It's just too complicated and discriminatory to implement. And why would you only punish U.S.-owned businesses? Makes no sense." Experts also question the range of legal powers of Trump in trade matters once he assumes the White House in January. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, administers trade policy enforcement. And the agency can apply tariffs based on country and product-specific categories, notes Robert Scott, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Company-specific penalties are imposed only when the Commerce Department concludes that a foreign exporter is under-cutting prices in the U.S. or being unfairly subsidized, thus violating U.S. anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. "I have no knowledge of any existing executive authority that will allow the president to apply any company-specific tariffs," Scott says. Still, a U.S. president has a variety of ways to initiate trade disputes, notes Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.  "The president can impose import restrictions after a finding that national security is at risk," he says in a recent research note. If Trump resorts to such measures, legal challenges by companies will surely follow. "If threats turn into actual restrictions, the U.S. can expect legal battles in the World Trade Organization," Hufbauer says. Trump's move to impose a 35% tariff  would have serious economic implications stemming from reactions abroad, economists say. The countries that are affected -- say, a factory shuttered abroad -- could impose higher tariffs on U.S. exports, making goods shipped from American factories more expensive. Reimported goods made by American companies abroad, carrying a 35% tariff, would obviously be priced higher, and that could also move domestic competitors to raises prices and generally lower consumers' buying power. "It would push us into a recession," Scott says. Even House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., sought to fend off tariff talks. When pressed by reporters earlier this week, he said he prefers avoiding tariffs to deal with American corporations fleeing the U.S. "The best way to make that change is through tax reform," McCarthy said. 
January 24, 2017	USA TODAY	After signing an order Monday abandoning the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, President Trump has set his sights on renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a prospect that worries the automotive industry. Trump laid out his strategy after being sworn in last week. In a post on the White House website, the administration pledges in a statement to negotiate "tough and fair" trade agreements with the goal of creating more U.S. jobs as a top goal. "This strategy starts by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and making certain that any new trade deals are in the interests of American workers," the statement says. "President Trump is committed to renegotiating NAFTA. If our partners refuse a renegotiation that gives American workers a fair deal, then the President will give notice of the United States' intent to withdraw from NAFTA."  Detroit's Big 3 automakers -- Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, General Motors and Ford, all either declined to comment or did not respond to emails seeking comment. The Auto Alliance, a lobbying organization for the industry, also didn't offer a comment. Automakers have been racing in recent weeks to pull any plans they have for U.S. investments and job creation off the shelf and announce them in an effort to blunt criticism from Trump for investing in Mexico. NAFTA, the free-trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, has contributed to a decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs, but it has led to massive automotive industry investment in Mexico and the growth of a supplier network there. Nearly every automaker -- both foreign and domestic -- has built new plants in Mexico in recent years. Mexico has surpassed Canada in annual vehicle production. Reversing those investments to build new plants in the U.S. would take years. Meanwhile, a large border tax, such as the 35% tariff Trump has threatened, would cause the price of many cars and trucks sold in the U.S. to soar. It could lead to a decline in industry sales and lead a steep decline in profits for automakers. "The new administration is suggesting a reversal in trade policy of a magnitude that hasn't been seen in decades, possibly since the 1920s," said Hoyt Bleakley, associate professor of economics at the University of Michigan. "A sudden increase in trade costs is a recipe for a slowdown, maybe a recession, as higher costs disrupt the supply chain." Last week, the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., issued a study that suggested scuttling NAFTA or imposing a massive border tariff could lead to U.S. job losses and could cause automakers to move to other low-cost countries for vehicle production rather than building new plants in the U.S. The  organization estimates that a 35% tariff on light vehicles imported from Mexico would quickly lead to a decline of 450,000 cars and trucks in the U.S. because of higher prices, hurting dealers and automakers. It also would lead to the loss of at least 31,000 U.S. jobs because of the volume of parts  made in the U.S. and shipped into Mexico. "If the U.S. leaves NAFTA, companies in Mexico and Canada may seek alternate, more affordable places to purchase these goods, such as China, India and other regions with large, international U.S. competitors," the Center for Automotive Research said. Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne said last week a 35% border tariff could force the automaker to stop producing cars in Mexico. "It's possible that if economic tariffs are imposed ... and are sufficiently large, it will make production of anything in Mexico uneconomical, and we would have to withdraw," Marchionne said. "It's quite possible." "I think we will adjust whenever the rules get changed, if they get changed. We have no choice in this. We are not policy setters," Marchionne said during a news conference at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. "I am not sure exactly what the rules are. Let's wait." Scott Keogh, president of Audi of America, said last week a border tariff would not hurt the German automaker as much as some other automakers. Audi decided five years ago to build a $1.3 billion factory in the south-central Mexico town of San Jose Chiapa to make its Q5 SUV. "This plant ... is a global plant. It makes cars for the entire world," Keogh said. "So, there is only one place to get a Q5 and that's (a Q5) made in Mexico. And it goes to Africa and South America and Europe and all over the world. The car used to be made in Germany, in fact, and now it's made in Mexico."
January 25, 2016	USA TODAY	After Mae Leng, a software engineer from the San Francisco area, heard U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio make a reference to China during an early January campaign speech in Boone, she patiently waited for him to finish and walked up to speak directly with the candidate. Leng, a native of China who is now a U.S. citizen, chatted with Rubio about American relations with China.  It's not the kind of experience she could have had in California -- or China, for that matter. Only in Iowa. "Personally, I feel this is much better of an experience compared to watching them on TV," said Leng, who noted she is neither a Republican nor a Democrat. "We are an immigrant family from China, love the American democracy and freedom, and would like to make our contributions as well." In the diners, gymnasiums and coffee shops that make up Iowa's campaign trail, prospective voters are joined by countless caucus tourists who flock here to snag a front-row seat to the kickoff of the presidential nominating contest. Some come to observe; others come to throw their support behind a candidate. And others come to take advantage of Iowa's media spotlight to advance their own causes. After all, Iowa is a place where  people can secure face time with the next president, ask a pointed question or snap a selfie. Some caucus tourists quickly hop over from neighboring states to catch a glimpse of their favorite candidates. Others travel from the farthest reaches of both coasts. And some are so drawn to the political process that they decide to call Iowa home -- at least for a little while. Last April, Rob and Claudia Host moved from Hawaii to West Des Moines so they could volunteer for Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign. "I wouldn't describe us as political junkies by any means," Rob Host said. "But we'd watched the Iowa caucuses from afar and we thought, 'What would it be like to live in Iowa during the caucuses?'" At the John Wayne Birthplace Museum in Winterset on Tuesday, Ryan Comstock of Clive, Iowa, found himself waiting for the third time in five days to catch a glimpse of businessman and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump -- the man he plans to caucus for on Feb. 1. "I'm an autograph collector, too, so that's part of the draw for me," Comstock said. "But he's always entertaining. Every time you see him, you kind of warm up a little bit to him." One morning last week, Justin Scott all but ran to the microphone to ask the first question of Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina. "I am an atheist voter. ... How do you plan to stand up for all Americans, not just believers or Christians?" he asked. Fiorina was the eighth candidate whom Scott, 34, has videotaped. Scott, a professional photographer from Waterloo, said he was inspired by activists working to raise the visibility and understanding of atheists. And with each new video he posts, he said, he hopes to highlight the importance of the separation of church and state. Walter Pesaresi, like many dedicated Ben Carson supporters, was first enamored by the retired brain surgeon the moment he called out President Obama at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast. "I said, 'That man needs to be president,'" recalled Pesaresi, who's 65. "Then I said, 'No, he's too good for politics.'" This month, the former middle school American history teacher carved out half a week to trail Carson across Iowa -- though he lives in Manhattan, Kan., where his caucus vote must wait until March 5.

September 7, 2016	USA TODAY	Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are close in a new CNN/ORC national poll. But the Republican nominee has a slight edge with voters likely to head to the polls.  Trump is ahead of Clinton 45%-43% among likely voters. That number is within the margin of error. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson had the support of 7% of likely voters, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein had 2%. The lead is flipped among registered voters. Clinton had 44% support of registered voters, Trump had 41%, Johnson had 9%, and Stein came in with 3% backing. The majority of registered voters (59%) think Clinton will ultimately prevail. Meanwhile, 34% of registered voters think that Trump will win in November. President Obama vowed Tuesday to work with the United Nations to tighten sanctions against North Korea, a day after the rogue nation fired another round of ballistic missiles into the sea. "We are going to work together to make sure we're closing loopholes and make them even more effective," Obama told reporters after meeting with South Korean President Park Geun Hye at a summit in Laos. Later Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council issued a statement strongly condemning North Korea's latest missile launch and threatening "further significant measures" if the reclusive nation refuses to stop its nuclear and missile tests. Two revered but threatened mammals are experiencing vastly different fates in the wild, scientists say. Thanks to a rise in available habitat throughout China, the population of giant pandas rose 17% from 2004 to 2014, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said, leading the group to move the panda off of its endangered species list. Meanwhile, IUCN downgraded the eastern gorilla, a victim of African civil wars and hunting, to "critically endangered." Hunting also has contributed to a 70% decline in the past 20 years, IUCN said. The eastern gorilla population is estimated at fewer than 5,000, moving it from "endangered" to "critically endangered."--Greg Toppo 
December 8, 2016	USA TODAY	President Obama gave an optimistic assessment of the campaign against terror on Tuesday, thanking U.S. troops for their help in "breaking the back" of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.  He did in the U.S., though, which I believe was to promote terror by bringing in a large number of refugees. Obama believes that his weak response to terrorism is a solution. All it has done is embolden terrorists, allowing them to grow and undermine the safety of this country. Thanks to Obama's strategy, the Islamic State of terrorism is losing, badly, and we're minimizing anything that terrorists could use as tools to recruit more people to their efforts. Terrorists are not emboldened. They would like nothing more than for the West to characterize this as an all-out war on Islam because that would push Muslims into their corner. What we are doing now seems like putting a finger on a leaky pipe. Thus, I don't think we should be the only country fighting terrorism at the level that we are. I think we should be generally keeping terrorism out of the U.S. When countries like Russia and China join us in fighting terrorism with the same intensity the U.S. is, then a more direct approach would be good. For the president who said he was going to end all of the wars the U.S. was actively participating in, how can Obama's time in office be seen as anything but a failure? All those immigrants entering Europe are a byproduct of terrorism, which was not dealt with under Obama's watch. Terrorism has, can and will result in a major cultural displacement, which will threaten world order, especially when there is a leadership vacuum abroad. We asked our followers if they thought President-elect Donald Trump will be able to handle threats to national security effectively. No, because someone who can't handle a tweet doesn't give me confidence he can handle a world crisis. Trump can't even handle a "Saturday Night Live" parody. How the heck is he going to handle national security threats? Scary times! Yes, I do and more effectively than now. Trump won't play games, and those pushing him will soon learn.
December 12, 2016	USA TODAY	During the campaign, Donald Trump described human-caused climate change as a scam and a hoax, and he vowed to take the United States out of the Paris accord, a global effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions and the warming they cause.  Since the election, the president-elect has changed his tune, telling Fox News Sunday that he is "open-minded" about the Paris agreement, and that he had "good meetings" recently with climate activists Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio. Those are encouraging words for the two-thirds of Americans rightfully worried about global warming. But there seems to be a disconnect between those words and Trump's actions in putting forth a slate of climate change skeptics for key administration jobs: Most troubling among them is Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma attorney general and fossil fuel industry ally, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt has sued the EPA -- unsuccessfully more often than not -- to block federal efforts to limit the poisons flowing from power plants, reduce smog, protect waterways, and cut climate-harmful methane. Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune compares putting Pruitt at the EPA to "putting an arsonist in charge of fighting fires." Trump's architect for EPA transition is Myron Ebell, director of a Washington think tank funded by coal and oil interests and a noted global warming skeptic. Ebell has accused  scientists of "manipulating and falsifying the data" on climate change. The president-elect's consideration for Interior secretary is Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash. A strong opponent of greenhouse gas regulations, she once said that Gore "deserves an 'F' in science and an 'A' in creative writing." If approved as Interior secretary, Rodgers would oversee energy policy on a half-a-billion acres of public land. The leading contender for secretary of State is Rex Tillerson, chief executive of energy giant ExxonMobil. Tillerson, to his credit, acknowledges that climate change is a threat and supports a carbon tax. But given his background, it's hard to imagine Tillerson promoting a transition away from fossil fuels. Thomas Pyle, a former Koch Industries lobbyist who is handling the transition at the Energy Department, authored a wish list for rolling back Obama administration climate initiatives: pulling out of the Paris accord; increasing energy production on federal lands; canceling President Obama's Clean Power Plan; and scaling back vehicle emission standards. U.S. leadership on climate issues is vital because America is second only to China in emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. More than 190 countries signed the Paris accord, and if Trump pulls the U.S. out, other nations discouraged by America's action might leave as well, vastly increasing the odds of highly dangerous warming with rising seas, growing drought and severe weather. On climate change issues, it's important to watch not just what Trump says, but also what he and his appointees do. Nothing less than the future of the planet could depend on it. 
December 14, 2016	USA TODAY	Donald Trump's vow to stop jobs from heading across the Mexican border might sound good, but it's not the grand plan to save jobs that some hope. The number of companies shifting production from the U.S. to Mexico is far from the epidemic implied by the president-elect. Just six U.S. companies out of a universe of thousands trading on a major exchange, including United Technologies, medical technology firm Becton, Dickinson and motion control parts maker Rexnord have indicated over the past 12 months plans to shift production from the U.S. to Mexico, according to a USA TODAY analysis of S&P Global Market Intelligence, which compiles a database of discontinued operations. Trump  has targeted two of these firms: United Technologies' Carrier unit and Rexnord. No companies have announced plans to move plants to China during that same period, according to the S&P Global database. It's not a complete list,  as many companies don't go out of their way to broadcast plans to relocate south of the border. But a review of company conference call transcripts, earnings reports and news reports show the trend to move jobs to Mexico isn't growing, but is one that happened years ago largely in the automotive sector. U.S. consumers and businesses are now reaping the benefits of these past moves.  At the same time, skilled workers with the ability to work in highly automated plants are retained or even see expanded opportunity in the U.S. About 65,000 U.S. factory jobs were offshored to  foreign countries in 2014 and 2015, each. Those lost jobs were offset by a roughly equal number created in the U.S. as  manufacturers moved production back home or foreign firms built plants here to tap the U.S. market, says Harry Moser, head of the Reshoring Initiative. The group serves as a consultant for firms looking to "reshore," or bring factories back to the U.S. Some companies that are moving jobs to Mexico are boosting jobs requiring more skill in the U.S. Take Merit Medical. Bernard Birkett, chief financial officer at the company, said in September it is "focusing on moving high-volume, labor-intensive products to our Mexico facility where we can benefit from lower cost environment." But here's the important offset: "Then in turn, filling that capacity that's been created in our U.S. facilities, with products coming through from (research and development) and also through acquiring new products." Trump, though, continues to pressure the few U.S. companies considering a move with threats of tariffs and other vows of protectionism, perhaps threatening higher paid jobs. "Companies are not going to leave the United States anymore without consequences. It's not gonna happen," Trump announced as he celebrated the decision of United Technologies, a large government contractor, to partially halt plans to move production of its Carrier air conditioning and refrigeration unit to Mexico, where labor costs are lower. Just how many companies are actually moving production south is a challenging question to answer. The Alliance for American Manufacturing says there have been 1,600 incidents of parties making Trade Adjustment Assistance claims to the Department of Labor since 2015. These are claims where workers are shown to suffer financial hardship due to production being outsourced overseas or competition from imports. But these aren't just companies making claims, but also individuals, unions or state agencies, so there could be overlap. The Alliance says it doesn't have a list of companies that have moved. There isn't a central repository for companies to file their plans to move production to Mexico. Relocation plans aren't recorded in financial statements, either, making generating a list difficult. But evidence is scant there's an exodus. Just seven companies in the broad Standard & Poor's 1500 discussed plans to move to Mexico in conference calls and investment conferences, according to S&P Global data, including Merit Medical and Standard Motor. There have been additional moves by companies such as Ford, which plans to move some of its small car production to Mexico, and casket maker Hillenbrand, which plans to close a U.S. plant that makes wooden caskets and move production to an existing plant south of the border. Oreo cookie maker Mondelez cut 600 positions from its Chicago bakery after a July 2015 investment in more automated production lines in Mexico. Much of the job loss was due to technology, says Laurie Guzzinati, spokeswoman at Mondelez. Even if the investments were made in Chicago, 300 positions would have still been lost, she said. She says the company still makes Oreo cookies in three other U.S. plants and has invested $450 million in other U.S. plants since 2012. 
December 23, 2016	USA TODAY	President-elect Donald Trump decried the state of the nation's nuclear arsenal Thursday, saying in a tweet that it had to be strengthened "greatly" during uncertain times.  "The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes," he tweeted. Trump made his remarks a day after receiving a national security briefing from a group of mostly senior military officers, including Air Force Lt. Gen. Jack Weinstein, deputy chief of staff for strategic deterrence and nuclear integration. A nuclear arms reduction expert reacted with alarm to Trump's tweet. Joseph Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, said similar statements by Russian President Vladimir Putin could trigger a destabilizing nuclear arms race. The United States and Russia have 95% of the world's nuclear weapons, but smaller nuclear powers, such as China, North Korea, India and Pakistan, may view their statements as a call to bolster their own arsenals, he said. "If the two guys with the biggest arsenals are talking about expanding, they're sending a message ... that it's time to start their engines," Cirincione said. An alternative, he said, would be for Trump and Putin to establish a relationship in which arms reduction is a centerpiece. "He could assure his place in the history books with the deal of a lifetime," Cirincione said. In a report in 2015, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that Obama administration plans to modernize nuclear forces would cost nearly $350 billion over 10 years. Gen. David Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, has emphasized the importance of the service's nuclear mission during a trip this week to U.S. air bases. He said the Air Force's top priority is maintaining a safe, secure and effective nuclear enterprise. The world has seen a dramatic reduction in the number of nuclear weapons in the past 25 years, Pentagon records show. Since 1991, Pentagon data show, more than 7,600 nuclear warheads have been deactivated, while the United States, Russia and former Soviet republics have destroyed more than 3,600 missiles and launchers, 33 submarines, 155 bombers, more than 1.6 million chemical munitions and more than 4,000 metric tons of chemical weapons. 
December 9, 2016	USA TODAY	As president, Donald Trump could profit substantially from foreign officials seeking to influence the new leader of the free world, a development that would violate the U.S. Constitution. From Trump Tower in the Philippines to India and Saudi Arabia, foreign leaders would have an obvious lever to attempt to curry favor with the nation's 45th president by pushing business to his children or other corporate officials, according to bipartisan ethics lawyers and constitutional scholars. "There's enormous potential for foreign influence over national policy, which is something we've always guarded against" over the nation's 240-year history, said Jay Wexler, a law professor at Boston University who published a book on lesser-known constitutional provisions.  Trump plans a Dec. 15 news conference with his children to announce what steps he will take to avoid conflicts of interest. The New York Times reported that the real estate billionaire may transfer operational control of his corporate empire to his two adult sons rather than relinquishing ownership to an independent trustee, as ethics experts are encouraging him to do. Two initial conflicts could land Trump in immediate violation of the "Emoluments Clause," an anti-bribery provision that forbids the president from receiving gifts from foreign leaders and is derived from the Latin word "emolumentum," meaning "profit" or "gain." It says political officials cannot "accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State." The clause is so absolute that, in 1787, it forbade any gifts -- even trinkets like copper, baubles and portraits.  In 2016, foreign dignitaries booking the new Trump International Hotel, just blocks from the White House, for his Jan. 20 inauguration and probably a loan from the Bank of China for one of his Manhattan office buildings would be violations, according to legal experts. Both can be considered profits or gains from foreign officials. For instance, on Wednesday Bahrain held a national day of celebration at the hotel. Trump has at least 28 foreign properties and partnerships that could generate money from foreign officials and trigger a violation of the Emoluments Clause, according to a USA TODAY analysis of financial disclosure forms. Beyond those 28 foreign properties are a series of  deals that could expand that list of potential sources of foreign income. In the Philippines, Trump's business partner has been named special envoy to the United States. Businessman Jose E.B. Antonio is the founder of Century Properties Group Inc., the company behind Trump Tower in Manila. Shares surged 20% the day after Trump was elected. President Rodrigo Duterte is conducting a bloody crackdown to "kill all" suspected drug users and dealers that's drawn strong foreign criticism including from the United States. According to Duterte, Trump endorsed his approach in a recent phone call. In Azerbaijan, Trump's partner is Anar Mammadov, a 34-year-old billionaire whose father is Azerbaijan's transportation minister accused of using his position to enrich his family. Mammadov is trying to rehabilitate the nation's "kleptocratic image" by "courting some of Washington's most powerful politicians," according to a 2015 article by Mother Jones. In India, Trump has licensed his brand to Trump Tower Mumbai, a luxury condo project being developed by Lodha Group, a real estate giant whose founder is a wealthy politician in the country's governing party. At an October campaign event in New Jersey, Trump boasted of his "massive" and "very beautiful" projects in India. Just after the election, some of his Indian business partners flew to New York to meet with him and his children. Newspapers in India reported it as a business meeting. Trump has registered eight new companies in Saudi Arabia. At an Alabama rally last year Trump said: "Saudi Arabia, I get along with all of them. They buy apartments from me. They spend $40 million, $50 million." Separately, in June 2001, Trump sold the 45th floor of Trump Tower to the Saudi royal family for $4.5 million, space that was later converted to the Saudi Mission to the United Nations, according to the New York Daily News.
January 17, 2017	USA TODAY	"The horrible Iran deal," President-elect Donald Trump tweeted just before the new year. These words have been largely ignored. They should not be. They indicate that his campaign pledge to tear up and renegotiate the nuclear accord with Iran remains viable. To be sure, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as it is formally called, is highly flawed. But it would be  risky for America to scuttle it now. First of all, it is improbable that Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany -- the other  parties to the deal -- would agree to jeopardize it. Pulling out would isolate the U.S. from the coalition it  created and leave no credible means for stopping Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.  A second reason to keep the deal is that during its first seven years, it delivers a period of significant constraints over Iran's nuclear program along with tight inspections and monitoring. But in the eighth year, 2023, as President Obama has acknowledged, the agreement will gradually allow Iran to build enough nuclear capability to reach almost zero "breakout time" (the time needed to produce enough fissile material to make a bomb). Third, tearing up the deal would create a dangerous void: Washington would be provoking Tehran when it has no credible leverage to restrain Iran on its own. Because this is an international rather than bilateral deal, so long as Iran complied with it, international sanctions would not be restored and international legitimacy for military action would be weak or withheld. The incoming Trump administration should revive the two main levers that brought Iran to the negotiations but were partially abandoned by the Obama administration: a credible threat of sanctions that could severely damage the Iranian energy and financial sectors, and a credible surgical military option. The prevailing impression today is that the U.S. is not willing to seriously challenge any Iranian violations of the agreement as long as Iran does not  produce nuclear weapons. Second, America will not hesitate to use military force to prevent Iran from dashing for the bomb or from reducing its breakout time to a few months or even weeks after restrictions begin to wane. This red line is crucial to maintaining the deal's main achievement -- prolonging Iran's breakout time to one year -- once international restrictions lift. The U.S., working with the other powers and Israel, should also use the deal's first eight years to counter Iran's non-nuclear misbehavior, which was excluded from the bargain. To secure the agreement, the Obama administration signaled its reluctance to halt Iran's attempts to achieve regional hegemony. Trump's public revulsion toward the deal provides him with more latitude in this realm. The new administration should assertively react to attacks on U.S. forces in the region by Iran or its allies, such as strikes by Yemen's Houthi rebels against U.S. Navy ships in October. It should thwart Iran's military aid to terror organizations, including Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, and Hamas. And it should enforce a United Nations Security Council resolution that  prohibits Iran from developing a ballistic missile program designed to carry nuclear weapons. Close cooperation with Israel could strengthen the American position. Israeli intelligence on Iran can assist in detecting Iranian violations, while an Israeli military threat could also persuade Iran not to exploit the flaws in the accord and shorten its distance to a nuclear bomb. The U.S. and Israel should formulate a parallel agreement to cope with this challenge, maximizing their joint assets and avoiding public quarrels. Their plan should provide Jerusalem with the necessary legitimacy and capacity to act as a last resort in coordination with Washington to prevent a nuclear Tehran.  If deterrence and diplomacy fail, this partnership could be the last chance to stop Iran from going nuclear. By not canceling the agreement, Trump would have the opportunity to amend its flaws and create a better strategic reality.  It is better than negating it, and better than allowing it simply to run its course. Amos Yadlin, former chief of Israeli military intelligence, is executive director of Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies.

January 24, 2017	USA TODAY	On Monday, the United States withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. President Trump may have signed the TPP's death certificate, but it was working people and our progressive allies who killed this unfair agreement. For years, we have mobilized and organized in opposition to the TPP, winning the debate in Congress and on the campaign trail.  While the 2016 election was full of division, Americans across the political spectrum are united in their desire for trade deals that create jobs and empower people, not corporations. With the TPP now off the table, the next step is to renegotiate the job-killing North American Free Trade Agreement. As always, the devil is in the details. Having failed to make an economic case for corporate trade deals like the TPP and NAFTA, free trade fundamentalists are hoping to convince us what's bad for working people is actually good foreign policy, especially as it relates to China. But here's what they're not telling you: The TPP and agreements like it would actually speed up China's growing dominance and give Beijing access to trade benefits without asking for anything in return. In fact, the same global firms that set the disastrous terms of the current U.S.-China trading relationship wrote the rules of the TPP. Among other giveaways, the TPP would have made brand-name drugs less affordable and given foreign corporations the power to sue governments in private tribunals over regulations they didn't like. In addition, the TPP did nothing to address critical bread-and-butter issues like currency manipulation and little to ensure workers' rights would be protected and enforced. The plain truth is the TPP-NAFTA model has weakened our position with China by holding down wages, stifling investment and exploding inequality. This is a moment to come together and advance a new trade agenda that benefits working people at home and strengthens our position in the world.
August 18, 2016	USA TODAY	In calling for "extreme vetting" of foreigners entering the USA, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump suggested a return to a 1950s-era immigration standard -- since abandoned -- that barred entry to people based on their political beliefs. "We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people," Trump said Monday, explaining how he would deter terrorists from entering the USA.  He cited an immigration law passed in 1952 over a veto by President Harry Truman that allowed consular officers to judge applicants based on their ideological views. In the years that followed, homosexuality was included as a reason for barring entry. "It became an embarrassment for America," said Barney Frank, a Democrat and former representative from Massachusetts. The ideological screening and ban on classes of individuals such as homosexuals were excised in a series of immigration law revisions from 1986 to 1990. Frank, the first openly gay member of Congress, co-authored the 1990 law. "We were going to scrub this and get rid of all these categories of exclusion and instead say, 'You can't come here if you are going to do us harm,'" said Frank, who served in Congress from 1981 to 2013. "In other words, your political opinion was irrelevant." Frank worked with Alan Simpson, then a Republican senator from Wyoming, on the changes, which received near unanimous approval by Congress in 1990. Both men said they can't fathom how ideological screening based on American "values" -- as Trump suggested -- could work in a nation of diverse beliefs. "What are the values? How do you decide them? And who decides whether they're good or bad?" Frank said. "Don't give me the American values stuff. I can't handle that," said Simpson, who retired in 1997. "Those are individual values. The only thing we have in common is a common flag and a common language." Trump spent several minutes during his speech on terrorism calling into question the toughness of vetting policies for the millions who enter the USA, a complex security review process that admits 40 million foreigners each year on temporary visas for business, education and other reasons. Some people enter more than once, and more than 1 million arrive to live here permanently. Nearly 1,200 people who tried to enter the USA on temporary visas in 2014 were rejected based on terrorist grounds, according to a Congressional Research Service report last year. "The burden of proof is always on the foreign national to prove they're eligible," said Ruth Wasem, author of the report and professor of public policy at the Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas-Austin. A triad of government departments -- State, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services -- work together to conduct thorough immigration reviews for the roughly 70,000 allowed to enter the USA as refugees seeking asylum, often from war-torn countries, according to Homeland Security. President Obama raised that figure to 85,000 for this year. In 2014, this included 14,582 refugees from Iraq, 12,514 from China, 9,804 from Myanmar and 652 from Syria.  Obama promised last year to take in 10,000 refugees from Syria. When Congress raised concerns last fall about the risk of allowing "sleeper" terrorists to infiltrate the USA through the refugee program, the State Department publicly outlined the security screening, which admits asylum applicants "only after subjecting them to the most rigorous screening and security vetting of any category of traveler to the United States." The process can take up to two years. Applicants identified as refugees, most of them by United Nations officials, have their personal data collected and files started on them at resettlement support centers operated by the United States around the world -- in places such as Amman, Havana, Beirut, Nairobi and Moscow. The State Department describes refugees as people with a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a social group. Syrians seeking refugee status go through additional scrutiny because Islamic State terrorists are based in Syria. Refugee applicants can be questioned about their religious affiliations, but there are no grounds for barring them based on their adherence to Sharia law, an Islamic religious code of behavior, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. In his speech, Trump said foreigners should be barred if they believe "Sharia law should supplant American law." 
December 16, 2016	USA TODAY	Why have an Electoral College? Alexander Hamilton made it plain: to ensure that "the office of president will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications." It is a safeguard against a demagogue putting our country's values and our security at risk.  Since his election, Donald Trump has ignored his serious conflicts of interest; skipped intelligence briefings while overturning generations of China policy; could have emboldened Philippine death squads; attacked the cast of the Broadway play Hamilton for speaking out; told whopping lies on Twitter; trashed our intelligence agencies; and defended the Kremlin from charges of interfering with our elections. This is not a partisan issue. Many honorable Republican leaders agree Mr. Trump is a walking, tweeting negation of core American values: liberty, service, compassion, respect for learning, humility and honor. Zero Republican presidents endorsed Mr. Trump, and Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 presidential nominee, said Trump is "playing the members of the American public for suckers." Whether Mr. Trump exhibits the "talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity" feared by the Founders is up to the electors. Twice in our history, the Electoral College has denied the presidency to winners of the popular vote -- Grover Cleveland and Al Gore -- with no serious charges of election "rigging." Monday, it could deny the presidency to a candidate whose qualifications are in question and who  lost the popular vote dramatically. The Electoral College need not elect  Hillary Clinton. It could choose a consensus candidate who might begin to heal our fractured republic. Our Founders wisely provided a mechanism to address this chaotic situation; it is folly not to use it. Thoughtful GOP leaders should join together today to release the electors to vote their conscience -- to save their party and our nation from years of tumult and danger. Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn.,  is the ranking member of the House NSA and Cybersecurity Subcommittee, part of the  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. 
November 10, 2016	USA TODAY	Donald Trump's win was largely expected to lead the Federal Reserve to rethink lifting interest rates next month. In the aftermath of Trump's victory to become the 45th president of the United States, both of those theories are in question. Some economists and futures markets still expect the Fed to act after stocks rebounded from a stomach-churning overnight sell-off. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics told investors immediately after Trump won, while global markets and U.S. stock futures were in disarray, that he expected the Fed to hold off. But after markets rallied Wednesday following Trump's conciliatory victory speech, "you could see the Fed following through," he told investors in a conference call. He noted economic growth and inflation are likely to pick up in coming months. The Fed lifted its benchmark rate in December for the first time in nine years but has held it steady since amid market volatility, the United Kingdom's Brexit vote, China's economic slowdown and meager U.S. inflation. The Fed signaled in its post-meeting statement last week it's poised to raise its federal funds rate from a historically low 0.4% in December, barring adverse shocks to the economy. Economic growth accelerated in the third quarter after a sluggish nine months, job growth has been steady and wage gains picked up in October, auguring more rapid inflation. Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist of the Economic Outlook Group, said the Fed will move next month in part to provide space to lower rates again next year. Wednesday, Fed fund futures gave about 76% odds of a rate increase in December, unchanged from the previous day. "There's just too much uncertainty out there now," said economist Gus Faucher of PNC Financial Services Group. 
December 22, 2016	USA TODAY	The Air Force's top officer said the service is critically short of personnel and needs to expand by more than 30,000 active-duty service members to meet its security obligations, including an air war against Islamic State militants. "We just got too small too fast, and we've got to grow," Gen. David Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, told USA TODAY in an interview Wednesday. "We're at a risk level I'm not comfortable with."  Goldfein, who was completing a five-day tour of air bases around the country,  said the trip reinforced his concerns that the service is stretched thin. "The shortage of people has fundamentally changed the way we do business," he said. "To most of the American people, they still think they have the Air Force of Desert Storm (the Persian Gulf War of 1990-91), and we're not even close." President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to rebuild the military, will probably face an array of requests from the services, which have lobbied for more troops and weapons in years past but have had to preside over smaller forces recently because of budget pressures despite a resurgence of threats, particularly in the Middle East. Goldfein said he will recommend expanding the size of the active-duty Air Force from about 317,000 to 350,000. It would probably take five or six years to reach the higher level. Under current plans, the Air Force planned to grow to 321,000. The increase in personnel size would cost about an additional $3billion a year on top of the Air Force's $151 billion budget. The U.S. military withdrew from Iraq in 2011 and has reduced the size of its force in Afghanistan to less than 10,000. In 2014, the Islamic State swept into Iraq and other parts of the Middle East, prompting the Obama administration to deploy roughly 5,000 troops in Iraq and begin a bombing campaign over Iraq and Syria. U.S. aircraft have dropped thousands of munitions targeting the Islamic State in both countries. The Air Force ferries tons of weapons and ammunition to Iraqi forces battling the Islamic State and has air-dropped supplies to a rebel force marching on Raqqa, the Islamic State's de facto capital in Syria. It is also responding to other global crises. "It seems like every two weeks, we're responding to a crisis or event around the globe," said Gen. Carlton Everhart, commander of the Air Mobility Command at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois. Russia and China are emerging as potential threats that could challenge the  military in ways the Islamic State has not. China is expanding its presence in the South China Sea, and Russia has become a major player in Syria's civil war, siding with the regime of President Bashar Assad. The  Air Force has rarely been challenged in the skies during its campaign against the Islamic State. That could change if the United States were to face another nation's military capable of rivaling  U.S.  technological advantages. This week, Goldfein spent a night with a crew in an underground nuclear control facility in a remote windswept corner of Nebraska. Airmen guard the facility round the clock, and a pair of young officers sit at the controls that would launch nuclear-tipped Minuteman III missiles from nearby silos if the president ordered strikes. 
January 13, 2017	USA TODAY	James Mattis, Donald Trump's nominee to head the Pentagon, testified Thursday that he supports efforts to engage with Russia but doubted the two countries would find ways to cooperate. Trump has spoken somewhat admiringly of the Russian leader and suggested the two countries could cooperate in fighting the Islamic State.  Mattis faced mostly polite questioning during a confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, suggesting his nomination will not face serious opposition in the Senate. Democratic leaders expressed hope that Mattis, a blunt-talking retired Marine four-star general, would be a moderating influence on Trump, whose controversial statements and tweets have fueled concerns about his character. "You will help oversee national security policy for a president who lacks foreign policy and defense experience and whose temperament is far different from prior presidents," Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., told Mattis. "Many Americans, and many in this body on both sides of the aisle, are rightly concerned about how he may respond when he is tested by Russia, Iran, North Korea and other transnational threats such as cyber." Mattis, a combat leader with more than four decades of uniformed service, is a departure from most recent Defense secretaries, who came from the ranks of civilian government service or politics. The Republican-led Senate passed a waiver 81-17 Thursday to allow Mattis to run the Pentagon, since federal law requires a seven-year gap between retirement from the military and assuming the Cabinet post. The statute was designed to safeguard the principle of civilian control over the military. The last retired general to head the Defense Department was George Marshall in 1950. The House Armed Services Committee also backed the waiver in a 34-28 vote. The full House is to vote Friday. Mattis described growing global threats and said the U.S. armed forces must remain the best led and "most lethal" in the world, admitting the nation has "shrunk our military capability." Mattis said there are "an increasing number of areas where we will have to confront Russia," adding that Putin is "trying to break" NATO. Mattis said if he is confirmed he would meet with the Trump administration's new security team to craft a strategy to confront Russia. More broadly, threats from Russia, China and global terrorism represent the biggest threat to world order since World War II, he said. Mattis faced questions from lawmakers about the integration of women into the infantry and other "combat arms" jobs. Women have served extensively in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, but until recently, they have been barred from some "combat arms" jobs, such as the infantry. Under the Obama administration, Defense Secretary Ash Carter ordered that all jobs, including the infantry, be open to women. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., cited speeches Mattis made expressing concerns about allowing women into the infantry, a physically demanding job that requires living for long periods of time under primitive conditions. Mattis said he was coming into the job without preconceived ideas. "I have no plan to oppose women in any aspect of our military," Mattis said. He said his chief concern was military readiness and the "lethality" of the force, which could suggest he might review some aspects of the policy if it could be shown that it hurt capabilities. The Marine Corps asked in 2015 for an exemption for its infantry units after a study that showed mixed-gender infantry squads were not as combat-effective as all-male units. Carter denied the exemption request, and the Marine Corps is taking steps to open the infantry to women. Mattis is revered inside the Marine Corps, where his aggressive style and frank conversation  were prized by young Marines. He commanded troops in Afghanistan in 2001 and  Iraq in 2003 and 2004. He served as an infantry battalion commander during the  Gulf War in 1990-91. He headed U.S. Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East, and  met frequently with leaders throughout the region.
December 12, 2016	USA TODAY	The Federal Reserve is virtually certain to raise interest rates this week for the first time this year, but the course of future hikes has suddenly become cloudier. The Fed has signaled for many weeks that it plans to hoist its key rate by a quarter percentage point at a two-day meeting that begins Tuesday, and futures markets say there's a 93% chance it will follow through. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal stimulus proposals may ultimately require faster rate increases to head off inflation, while other byproducts of his plan could slow the economy and prompt the Fed to act more cautiously.  For now, economists don't expect Fed policymakers to weigh such hypotheticals as they draft  quarterly projections for rate increases over the next few years. Even so, with unemployment falling rapidly and inflation finally picking up, Fed officials likely are no longer inclined to call for slower rate hikes over the long-term, as they have in each of their previous forecasts this year amid headwinds such as weak productivity growth, economists say. "Unemployment is falling toward levels that are arguably below stable inflation," says Tim Duy, a University of Oregon  professor and author of the Fedwatch blog.  He says the Fed will almost certainly reiterate that rate increases will be gradual. In November, the jobless rate dropped to 4.6% from 4.9% the previous month. That's already below the 4.8% that the Fed has deemed the lowest average rate sustainable without generating excessive inflation, or rapid price increases that decrease consumers' purchasing power and especially hurt savers and those on fixed incomes. Low unemployment typically pushes up wages as employers compete for fewer  workers, and price increases typically follow as the firms scramble to maintain profit margins. That doesn't mean persistently low inflation is poised to suddenly spike. While an inflation measure closely monitored by the Fed rose from 1.2% to 1.4% annually in October as the effects of low gasoline prices faded, that's well below the Fed's 2% target. Still, it was the fastest pace in two years. And annual wage growth hit a seven-year high in October and has climbed steadily since early 2015 in "a further signal that inflation is firming," Barclays economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients. In September, Fed Chair Janet Yellen noted that discouraged workers on the sidelines were streaming back into the labor force, keeping the unemployment rate elevated and providing the economy "more room to run" without stoking inflation. But the labor force shrank in both October and November, giving the Fed another reason to make a move this week and stick with its previous forecast of two rate hikes next year and three in 2018. "If you were to wait any longer, you would risk getting behind the curve," says JPMorgan Chase economist Michael Feroli. The Fed held off on rate increases earlier this year in response to China's slowdown and a sluggish U.S. economy, among other factors. The future roadmap is fuzzier. Trump has proposed a $1 trillion plan to upgrade the nation's infrastructure and sharp tax cuts, a stimulus package that, if passed by Congress, could fuel inflation and force the Fed to lift rates more rapidly. But, "it's probably too early for the Fed to incorporate any fiscal policy issues into their forecast," Duy says. It's similarly too soon, he says, to anticipate negative economic fallout from Trump's restrictive trade proposals. On the other hand, the prospect of more federal spending and faster economic growth and inflation under Trump already has strengthened the dollar and pushed up long-term interest rates. Those developments  could crimp the economy by hurting  exports and discouraging consumer and business borrowing. 
November 1, 2016	USA TODAY	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has made bashing China and Mexico a staple of his campaign. Both he and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton have turned sour on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the proposed pact linking 12 nations in Asia (excluding China) and the Americas. And recent numbers show that trade volume has flattened out globally after years of expansion.  But there is good reason to believe that the harsh anti-trade rhetoric is more a function of politics than public sentiment. A Pew Research Center poll in August, for instance, found that 50% of respondents view free-trade agreements as a positive, while 42% see them as negative. That level of support is essentially where it was early in the year and down slightly from mid-2015. The same poll found that TPP was supported by 40% and opposed by 35%, with the rest unfamiliar with the deal or not having an opinion. There is also good reason to see that the economic case for trade is strong. Yes, trade creates winners and losers. And, yes, more needs to be done to retrain displaced workers and offer them educational opportunities. But the winning side is wider and deeper: Trade produces cheaper consumer products for struggling families. In most contexts, Americans would not support policies that make them pay more for something just to benefit a relative few. They certainly wouldn't tolerate tariffs on imported oil to prop up domestic energy producers. So why should they be made to pay more for cars or clothes or building supplies? Trade produces competition that spawns innovation. Who could doubt that Detroit creates vastly better products now than it did in the 1970s, when imports were a relatively insignificant part of the domestic auto market? Trade produces export-related jobs. Many of the job losses blamed on commerce agreements are actually the result of technology that allows more goods to be manufactured with fewer workers. While it is true that trade and automation have been brutal on certain types of jobs, trade has had a brighter side as well. The United States exports $2.3 trillion in goods and services each year, producing 11.3 million jobs. These export-related jobs tend to be higher skilled and better paying than the ones eliminated. Many of them are in high tech, pharmaceuticals and financial services. And, in fact, access to world markets has allowed companies such as Apple and Microsoft to become iconic global brands. Exports have also come from some surprising areas. In 2014, for instance, Honda became the first Japanese car maker to become a net exporter from the United States. The remorselessly protectionist rhetoric on the campaign trail, including Trump's over-the-top attacks on NAFTA and Clinton's flip-flop on TPP, appeals to voters in Rust Belt battleground states. But it does not reflect the broader economic reality that robust trade helps an innovative, ambitious nation like the United States far more than it hurts. 
January 18, 2017	USA TODAY	Chinese online shopping giant Alibaba announced Monday it has formed a coalition that will leverage the power of big data to crack down on purveyors of fake goods, whose value in 2015 exceeded $1.7 trillion, according to the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition.  U.S. companies suffer most at the hand of brand pirates, with one-in-five knockoffs infringing on American products, and 63% of counterfeit goods come from China, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The mission of the Alibaba Big Data Anti-Counterfeiting Alliance, whose 20 members include luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Swarovski, is to pool information, data and expertise in intellectual property authentication with the ultimate goal of "helping block, screen and take down infringing listings," according to a statement from Alibaba. "The most powerful weapon against counterfeiting today is data and analytics, and the only way we can win this war is to unite," said Jessie Zheng, Chief Platform Governance Officer of Alibaba Group. Alibaba, which sells 14.5 billion items a year to Amazon's 5 billion according to courier ParcelHero, has been aggressive about using data analytics to put counterfeiters out of business. Its software currently scans 10million product listings a day. In the 12 months ending last August, the company closed down 180,000 third-party stores for trafficking in fake items. During that same period, Alibaba provided sufficient information to brands and law enforcement agencies to close 675 counterfeit goods manufacturing operations, the company said. According to the OECD's 2016 report, "Trade in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Mapping the Economic Impact," brands most affected by counterfeiters include Rolex, Ray-Ban, Louis Vuitton and Nike. In fact, footwear tops the categories, followed by clothing, leather goods and electrical equipment. Alibaba's executive chairman, Jack Ma, recently traveled to New York City's Trump Tower to meet with President-elect Donald Trump. Ma has pledged to create 1 million U.S. jobs by growing trade between small U.S. businesses and Chinese consumers. Amazon recently announced plans to create 100,000 U.S. jobs over the next 18 months. Most of the positions will be at fulfillment centers, including new facilities under construction in California, Florida, New Jersey and Texas. The new employees will also work in areas such as cloud technology, machine learning, and advanced logistics. 
November 16, 2016	USA TODAY	It is a testament to Donald Trump's political skills that his supporters were never deterred by his  excesses and reversals. Trump explainers say the experts missed this moment because they demanded specificity and facts from the president-elect in a way his devotees did not. "The press takes him literally, but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally," Salena Zito wrote in The Atlantic. Though Trump supporters might possess a remarkable capacity to suspend disbelief, the rest of the world will not be so forgiving. As the commander in chief of the armed forces and guarantor of the post-war geopolitical order, every statement out of Trump's mouth will be taken quite literally by both America's allies and adversaries.  The foundation of deterrence is a clear and unequivocal understanding of what interests a nation will fight to defend. Vagueness in the realm of statecraft leads revisionist powers to test their parameters and, in so doing, risk overreaching and miscalculation. That's how wars start. We don't have to go diving into the deepest recesses of history to support the contention that U.S. presidents must say what they mean and mean what they say. President Obama drew a red line over the prospect of Syrian President Bashar Assad deploying chemical weapons against civilians, but Obama's bluff was called and the world saw him blink. The following years were typified by aggressive nations testing Washington's commitment to defending the status quo. Not since World War II has a European power invaded and summarily annexed neighboring territory, but that's what an emboldened Russian President Vladimir Putin did in 2014. This brazen test of the Western powers that had guaranteed Ukrainian territorial integrity occurred only after Obama leaned on Moscow to save him from himself by negotiating the surrender of Assad's chemical stockpiles. In the end, Assad maintained and still uses his chemical weapons. Beijing, too, watched Obama back off his red line. When he took office, Obama dedicated himself to reorienting U.S. diplomatic and military posture toward the Asia Pacific. The "pivot to Asia" seemed forever on the horizon and, by 2014, was not yet manifest in the form of appreciably more U.S. naval hardware in the region. Assured of American timidity, China created territory from whole cloth in the contested South China Sea, turning man-made islands into fortresses dedicated to power projection. Obama was generally prudent about the language he used when he knew that the world was listening. Yet the president's moment of incaution made for a more dangerous world. What will be the effect of a far less circumspect president tripping over his words on a more regular basis? Trump has already given the West's adversaries cause to test him. When The New York Times asked whether he'd come to the aid of Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania in the event of a Russian incursion, Trump refused to say and added: "We have many NATO members that aren't paying their bills." Yet NATO's mutual defense provisions require such a military response, and in any case Estonia is one of five NATO member states that met its 2015 requirement to spend the equivalent of 2% of GDP on defense. This is a signal to Russia's expansionist president, who will surely take advantage of what he perceives to be new latitude. China is frequently the subject of Trump's tough talk, but no state would so benefit from America's retreat from its financial obligations. The likely death of the 12-member Trans-Pacific Partnership may lead to regional trade pacts that privilege Chinese and Japanese markets and don't impose U.S. standards on them. Anticipating Trump's promised "trade war" with China, the Pacific is pivoting unto itself. Trump also has said that South Korea and Japan might need their own nuclear weapons to protect themselves, because America can't afford it anymore. It's only smart for Asia to prepare for a post-American future. In the cold, hard power logic of geopolitics, history hangs on the American president's every word. Being coy or offhand about U.S. security priorities can lead to the kind of miscalculations that have the potential to devolve into cascading cycles of proportionately escalating retaliation. Absent cooler heads, those cycles can spiral out of control. A president does not have the luxury of imprecise language. Trump's fans may not take his words seriously, but America's enemies most certainly will.
October 5, 2016	USA TODAY	Though nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize are kept secret and not revealed by the Norwegian Nobel Committee until 50 years later, organizers do release the number of nominations: 376 this year -- 228 individuals and 148 organizations.  Anyone can technically be nominated for the $930,000 accolade, but only a person deemed qualified by the Nobel committee to nominate candidates can do so. Since 2002, the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) has produced a shortlist of candidates that it says merit the distinction. The shortlist is chosen by PRIO Director Kristian Berg Harpviken. Monday, Harpviken dropped Colombia from his list after voters rejected a peace deal that would have ended 52 years of conflict between the government and rebels. According to Harpviken, Donald Trump and the actress Susan Sarandon have been nominated -- Trump for "his vigorous peace through strength ideology, used as a threat weapon of deterrence against radical Islam, the Islamic State, nuclear Iran and communist China" and Sarandon for "helping refugees in Greece" over Christmas. Gannushkina is the founder of the Civic Assistance Committee, a group that offers legal aid, education and assistance to migrants and refugees. Her work has focused on the human rights of displaced people and different ethnic groups in Russia and former Soviet republics. There was speculation last year that the prize would go to Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif, Secretary of State John Kerry or the European Union's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, for their work on the Iran nuclear deal. Harpviken said that amid what appears to be easing tensions and renewed diplomatic contacts between Iran and the West, the award should be shared between the energy ministers of Iran and the United States. Composed of regular citizens, the Syrian Civil Defense, or "White Helmets," is a team of volunteer emergency workers who risk their lives to pull out civilians trapped in the rubble of buildings targeted by bombs in Syria's five-year civil war. The network of about 3,000 volunteers has saved about 60,000 lives, according to the group. To some, Snowden is a traitor who should be jailed for leaking information about secret U.S. surveillance programs. To others, he is a heroic whistle-blower whose revelations about U.S. snooping led to political and legal changes and who does not deserve exile in Russia. The trio are gynecologists who specialize in treating victims of rape and sexual violence. Banyere and Bindu have provided help to survivors of sexual attacks across the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Mukwege set up a hospital dedicated to this work and personally treated thousands of women. 
October 5, 2016	USA TODAY	The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its forecast for economic growth in the U.S. and other advanced economies, citing increasing risks from isolationist sentiment, but upgraded its outlook for emerging markets.  As a result of the offsetting dynamics, the IMF left its global growth estimate unchanged from its July projection at 3.1% this year and 3.4% in 2017 and renewed its call for more forceful government action to fuel economic activity. "Taken as a whole, the world economy is moving sideways," IMF Economic Counselor Maurice Obstfeld said at a news conference at the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, D.C. In the U.S., the IMF lowered its growth estimate to 1.6% this year and 2.2% in 2017, down from 2.2% and 2.5%, respectively, in July. The agency cited weaker-than-expected growth of 1.1% at an annual rate in the second quarter as continued sluggish business investment and stockpiling offset solid consumption. The fund traced the soft capital spending to the energy sector downturn, the negative effects of a strong dollar on exports and "possibly also the financial market volatility and recession fears of late 2015 and early 2016." Advanced economies overall, which include Europe and Japan, are also expected to grow 1.6% this year, down from the July projection of 1.8%. The IMF estimates advanced countries will expand by 1.8% next year. The IMF modestly marked down its global outlook in July after the United Kingdom's Brexit vote raised the prospect of disrupted trade relationships. On the bright side, the agency said market reaction to the vote "has generally been contained," with stocks recovering after an initial sell-off. But the agency added in a report Brexit "is very much an unfolding event." The U.S. and Europe also have been hampered by weak productivity growth, aging populations and income gains that have largely flowed to the highest earners, the IMF said. The latter trend has stoked an isolationist movement that could further hamper economies in those regions. "The result in some richer countries has been a political movement that blames globalization for all woes and seeks somehow to wall of the economy from global trends rather than to engage productively with foreign nations," Obstfeld said. He added that such an effort is "likely to depress global growth further." That isolationist sentiment has been reflected in Europe by the Brexit vote and in the U.S. by the presidential election, the agency said. Both Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton have espoused anti-trade policies to different degrees. Offsetting the dimmer picture in advanced economies is a more favorable outlook in China and other emerging markets. Although China's economy continues to grapple with a challenging shift in focus from investment to consumption, concerns about the country's near-term prospects have eased after the government's decision to keep interest rates low and strong credit growth, the IMF said. It expects China to to grow 6.6% this year and 6.2% in 2017, unchanged from July. Meanwhile, the IMF estimates emerging markets overall will expand by 4.2%, up from its 4.1% forecast in July. 
November 16, 2016	USA TODAY	The post-election sell-off in the bond market and spike in borrowing costs have caught the attention of a wary Wall Street. The rise in the yield on the 10-year Treasury note from 1.86% on Election Day to an intraday high of 2.31% Monday -- its highest level of the year -- is being eyed with caution.  The reason: Low interest rates have been a key driver of the nearly 8-year-old bull market in stocks. Despite yields moving lower to 2.22% Tuesday, the latest spike in rates comes as the U.S. stock market is pricey by historical standards, making it vulnerable. The recent surge in bond yields has been driven in large part by President-elect Donald Trump's pro-growth fiscal plans, which include tax cuts and government spending on infrastructure. Though these policy moves could lead to stronger economic growth, they could also result in higher inflation. Bond investors fret over a possible interest rate hike next month from the Federal Reserve, which would mark the U.S. central bank's first rate increase since December 2015. Stock investors who remained upbeat on equities, anticipating that the Fed would keep rates "lower for longer," now grapple with the likelihood of less Fed stimulus. "Since the regime change in Washington," says Trip Miller, founder and managing partner at Gullane Capital, "there's definitely a push for lower taxes and to prime the pump" as Trump looks to bolster the economy. "Equities can advance, but higher rates will be a challenge," says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. There's "no need (for stock investors) to panic," Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, says. He says the 10-year note yield "remains near historic lows" and back to where it was at the start of the year when investors feared China's economy was imploding and oil prices were hitting fresh lows. Another reason not to give up on stocks is the reason why bond yields are rising -- "hopes that additional fiscal stimulus will boost economic activity," Jessop says, adding that higher inflation might prove to be a positive as it "could be seen as a welcome shift away from the fears of deflation that have overshadowed the eurozone and Japan." Stocks could benefit from a continued sell-off in the bond market if investors shift cash from bonds to stocks, says Bill Hornbarger, chief investment officer at Moneta Group. The mix of better growth and a slight uptick in inflation, he says, means stocks might not feel a stiff headwind from bonds until the 10-year Treasury hits 4% or 5%. 
January 6, 2017	USA TODAY	Congressman Darrell Issa on Wednesday re-introduced legislation to change eligibility requirements for H-1B visa exemptions and limit the outsourcing of jobs. The Protect and Grow American Jobs Act, co-authored by Issa, R-Calif., and U.S. Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., addresses what's sure to be a hot-button issue this year amid repeated vows by President-elect Donald Trump to overhaul immigration laws. But it faced opposition last year in Congress and could encounter more resistance this time around.  Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who has worked on immigration overhaul for more than a decade and frequently discussed the topic with Issa, says the bill would hurt Silicon Valley -- which includes her district -- and plans to introduce legislation of her own. Reshaping immigration is a central tenet of Trump's push for companies, in particular tech, to invest and hire more in the U.S. He has directed his wrath at Apple for its vast offshore operations in China and Ireland, underscoring his frayed relationship with the tech community. Issa's legislation "will ensure that our valuable high-skilled immigration spots are used by companies when the positions cannot be filled by the existing workforce," Issa said in a statement. It was inspired after Disney, Southern California Edison and other companies came under fire for skirting the visa program to replace American workers with less-expensive foreign workers from overseas, a spokesman for Issa said. In essence, the bill is intended to close a loophole in the nation's high-skilled immigration system being used by some companies to import cheaper foreign labor, its proponents say. It would raise the salary requirement for the positions to $100,000 a year, up from $60,000, and eliminate the master's degree exemption. But Lofgren says the bill "doesn't do anything" to stop outsourcing and will prompt companies that abuse the program to concentrate in higher-paying areas where $100,000 would still undercut American wages. (The median income in Silicon Valley is $115,000, she says, with engineers commanding more than $140,000 for starting pay.) She says: "It is clear (Issa) is feeling the heat to do something with outsourcing a major issue in his district," which comprises northern portions of San Diego County and southern Orange County. 
January 13, 2017	USA TODAY	General Motors has become one of the first automakers to import a model, in this case, the Envision SUV, from China. Considering how international the auto industry has become, it wouldn't necessarily be viewed as a radical move. Cars come from all over the world now, from South Korea to Slovenia.  But China is different. In the past decade, the U.S. auto industry was swept by a wave of fear that China, home to the world's largest auto market, might unleash a wave of cheap cars into the U.S. The Chinese were stopped by the realization that demand was so great at home, a rapidly industrializing society, that there were few cars left over that could be exported. Also, U.S. makers just didn't believe Chinese factories could meet the quality standards that Americans have come to expect. Fast forward to today. The Chinese car market is maturing, and demand softened a bit in the past year. There is enough factory capacity to justify exports to the U.S. Also, the Chinese have proved to be ravenous for foreign-made luxury goods themselves. It hasn't been U.S. or European consumers demanding better quality. It has been the Chinese themselves -- and that has raised the bar for Chinese-made products. We knew all that. But we wanted to see if Envision can match up to GM's best. And it appears  it does. We looked for flaws, mismatches or wide gaps in panels. We cocked an ear for  squeaks or rattles. We didn't hear or see anything out of the ordinary. Envision is a compact SUV that slots into the Buick SUV lineup between the subcompact Encore and the three-row Enclave. It's in a hot segment, but if you haven't heard about it, don't be surprised. General Motors hasn't done much to promote Envision. Though GM hasn't tried to hide its Chinese manufacture, one theory is that the automaker doesn't want to set off alarm bells that could take the form of further Twitter messages from President-elect Donald Trump. Envision has all the attributes of a solid Buick. It is well insulated, in keeping with the brand's appreciation of hush in the cabin. The 2.5-liter, 4-cylinder engine performed admirably and mostly silently, in every situation. It's no speed demon, but it gets the job done. The car showed we got 24.1 miles per gallon over 333 miles of driving, smack dab where you'd expect given that the city gas mileage rating is 20 mpg and the highway rating is 26 mpg. Interestingly, Envision has a 6-speed automatic transmission at a time when competing brands are moving to 8 or more speeds. The interior is nice, including the stitching on the seats, though we've never been a fan of what we consider Buick's over-ample use of wood-grain paneling. Speaking of seats, Envision comes with the butt-thumper, the system that warns through the seats if you're close to bumping into something when you back up. We did appreciate one feature that speaks to tradition: knobs for turning up the volume and picking radio stations. Old-fashioned, yes, but it works far more effectively than the newfangled touch screens like the one in the Acura MDX we reviewed last week. Also good in Envision: the forward-collision warning system, which flashed a bright red bar across the driver's side of the windshield. It was one of the best we've seen -- effective without being overly intrusive. The  Envision we drove came fully loaded for $44,135, including $925 destination. Not bad for a near-luxury SUV and showing how far Chinese manufacturing has come.

In the past decade, the U.S. auto industry was swept by a wave of fear that China, home to the world's largest auto market, might unleash a wave of cheap cars into the U.S. The Chinese were stopped by the realization that demand was so great at home, a rapidly industrializing society, that there were few cars left over that could be exported. Also, U.S. makers just didn't believe Chinese factories could meet the quality standards that Americans have come to expect. Fast forward to today. The Chinese car market is maturing, and demand softened a bit in the past year. There is enough factory capacity to justify exports to the U.S. Also, the Chinese have proved to be ravenous for foreign-made luxury goods themselves. It hasn't been U.S. or European consumers demanding better quality. It has been the Chinese themselves -- and that has raised the bar for Chinese-made products. We knew all that. But we wanted to see if Envision can match up to GM's best. And it appears  it does. We looked for flaws, mismatches or wide gaps in panels. We cocked an ear for  squeaks or rattles. We didn't hear or see anything out of the ordinary. Envision is a compact SUV that slots into the Buick SUV lineup between the subcompact Encore and the three-row Enclave. It's in a hot segment, but if you haven't heard about it, don't be surprised. General Motors hasn't done much to promote Envision. Though GM hasn't tried to hide its Chinese manufacture, one theory is that the automaker doesn't want to set off alarm bells that could take the form of further Twitter messages from President-elect Donald Trump. Envision has all the attributes of a solid Buick. It is well insulated, in keeping with the brand's appreciation of hush in the cabin. The 2.5-liter, 4-cylinder engine performed admirably and mostly silently, in every situation. It's no speed demon, but it gets the job done. The car showed we got 24.1 miles per gallon over 333 miles of driving, smack dab where you'd expect given that the city gas mileage rating is 20 mpg and the highway rating is 26 mpg. Interestingly, Envision has a 6-speed automatic transmission at a time when competing brands are moving to 8 or more speeds. The interior is nice, including the stitching on the seats, though we've never been a fan of what we consider Buick's over-ample use of wood-grain paneling. Speaking of seats, Envision comes with the butt-thumper, the system that warns through the seats if you're close to bumping into something when you back up. We did appreciate one feature that speaks to tradition: knobs for turning up the volume and picking radio stations. Old-fashioned, yes, but it works far more effectively than the newfangled touch screens like the one in the Acura MDX we reviewed last week. Also good in Envision: the forward-collision warning system, which flashed a bright red bar across the driver's side of the windshield. It was one of the best we've seen -- effective without being overly intrusive. The  Envision we drove came fully loaded for $44,135, including $925 destination. Not bad for a near-luxury SUV and showing how far Chinese manufacturing has come. 
April 29, 2016	USA TODAY	One of the more unusual topics of this very unusual election year has been the hitherto uncontroversial issue of the U.S. commitment to NATO. Last month, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump slammed NATO for being "obsolete." This week, as he swept closer to the GOP nomination, he softened that to "outdated" but repeated his call for changes -- including making allies pay more. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders similarly has argued that the United States should scale back its NATO commitments. These ideas have drawn fierce criticism from the defense and foreign policy establishments. Victor Davis Hanson, a historian at the Hoover Institute, acknowledged the salience of Trump's argument but then backflipped to argue for the organization's continued relevance anyway: "A powerful Russia will always have to be watched. A dynamic and headstrong Germany will always have to be integrated into some sort of military alliance. And the United States will always have a natural self-interest in pre-emptively keeping kindred Europeans from killing each other."  Yet there are good reasons to take Trump's and Sanders' arguments seriously. On one level, NATO really is obsolete. It was established in 1949 to ensure the collective defense of Western Europe against the threat of a Soviet invasion. At the time, this did not seem like a particularly remote possibility. NATO succeeded in keeping Western Europe safe for more than 40 years, until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Then a curious thing happened: NATO both lost its rationale for existing and went through a dramatic expansion of member states. As the Soviet sphere collapsed and Russia struggled with persistent economic malaise, the U.S. pushed through the admittance of Eastern European countries into NATO. By 2009, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary were  members. So were the three Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- all of which, unlike other NATO members, have common borders with Russia. Russian leaders have argued that in expanding NATO, U.S. leaders broke their promise to not exploit the Soviet collapse to extend NATO into Russia's sphere of interest. Many foreign policy writers and journalists -- consistent with the official Russian line -- say Western efforts to bring Ukraine into NATO led to the prolonged political crisis and partial Russian occupation of that beleaguered country. Now, NATO no longer has a clearly defined contemporary purpose. If anything, it has been the source of increasing friction. Most important, it is incapable of dealing with the threats of the 21st century, especially terrorism. Collective defensive treaties are meant to ensure the safety of states against other states. They don't provide an  effective framework for confronting non-state threats such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, which use guerrilla tactics rather than amassing armies on a nation's borders. Let's call out NATO for what it is: a 20th century organization adrift in a 21st century world. Instead of paying the majority share of its exorbitant costs, the U.S. should shift more of the burden to its NATO partners and transition to a more flexible defensive system. NATO  should be phased out and replaced by  bi- or multilateral arrangements between America and different countries. Under NATO, defense defines the nature of U.S. relations with the other 27 member countries. A  phaseout would allow a greater role for diplomatic relations where appropriate. Some countries might need more military assurance than others. Estonia and Latvia, for instance, could have greater defensive needs against Russian incursion than France. By reducing the financial burdens of NATO, America also would be freer to develop and strengthen partnerships in the Middle East, where Russian involvement  in Syria marks a new challenge,  and in the Pacific, where North Korea and China remain  concerns. Finally, phasing out NATO  would signal to Russia that the U.S. and Western Europe were no longer attempting to encroach on its interests. Renegotiating our alliance system will better reflect U.S. economic reality and allow us to better handle an increasingly complex world. We need to be able to grapple with tomorrow's problems unburdened by the legacies of yesteryear. Michael Harris is dean of the College of Public Service at Tennessee State University.

June 2, 2016	USA TODAY	With one eye on his historical legacy and another on this year's election, President Obama on Wednesday trumpeted his economic record, ripped Republican political ideas and urged voters to elect a Democratic successor who will follow through on his policies. "If what you really care about in this election is your pocketbook -- if what you're concerned about is who will look out for the interests of working people and grow the middle class ... then the debate is not even close," Obama said during a campaign-style speech in Elkhart, Ind.  In returning to Elkhart -- a city he visited during his first year in office in 2009 in the midst of a recession-triggering financial crisis -- Obama stressed the decline of the unemployment rate and steady increases in job growth during his two terms in office. He touted the administration's initiatives ranging from the landmark health care law to new Wall Street regulations. Obama delivered his speech as Republican critics, including presumptive presidential nominee Donald Trump, said the recovery is uneven at best, citing stagnant wages and trade deals they said have undercut manufacturing jobs in the USA. "We are losing our jobs to everybody," Trump told supporters in California last week. "We are going to bring back jobs like we haven't seen in this country for many, many decades." House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Obama has a "legacy of economic malaise," and "Americans deserve more than a victory lap celebrating stagnant wages, lukewarm economic growth (and) persistently high poverty rates." Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders praise Obama's administration, but they have raised economic concerns, including increased college costs and income inequality. Both Democrats oppose the Obama-backed Asian trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Though he didn't mention Trump (or any other candidate) by name, Obama said the Republicans picked their presidential nominee because of "economic anxiety" fueling "an unusual election year." He repeatedly denounced Trump's proposals, saying that the idea of deporting 11 million people in the country illegally is a "fantasy" and that "we cannot put up walls around America." Arguing that the political parties have "two very different visions," Obama said the Republicans' approach to the economy would "lower wages, eliminate worker protections, cut investments in things like education, weaken the safety net, kick people off health insurance and let China write the rules for the global economy." The president said that for decades, Republicans have spread "myths" about the impact that immigration, welfare programs, trade policy and "big government" have had on the economy and middle-class families. He denounced what he called the GOP's "cult of small government." The Democratic agenda, Obama said, "won't solve every problem" or "make everybody financially secure overnight," but it will "point us in the right direction." In 2009, the president visited the Elkhart area before and after passage of the $840 billion stimulus bill, a package of infrastructure and education projects Obama and aides call the Recovery Act. The stimulus and other Obama administration actions, including the automobile industry bailout, helped stave off another Great Depression, the president said. Elkhart, a city known for production of recreational vehicles, saw its unemployment rate soar to 19.6% during the financial crisis; Obama noted that it is now down to about 4%. Nationally, the jobless rate has fallen from 10% to 5% this past April. Casting Elkhart as a symbol of America's recovery, Obama cited reductions in home foreclosures and increases in high school graduation rates. He said the U.S. economy  is improving despite Republican efforts to obstruct most of his plans. "America's economy is not just better than it was eight years ago, it is the strongest, most durable economy in the world," Obama said. 
June 6, 2016	USA TODAY	In a flash, the U.S. labor market appeared to morph Friday from a reliable race car into a creaky bicycle. Not only did the economy create just 38,000 new jobs in May, its weakest showing since 2010, but the Labor Department revised down employment gains for the previous two months by 59,000. That cut average monthly gains in 2016 to about 150,000 from 209,000 last year. Why have employers suddenly throttled back hiring? And is this the new baseline for a labor market that's been a pillar of the economy?  The short answer: Job growth is expected to slow somewhat now that the economy is approaching full employment, but gains the past two months have been suppressed by myriad temporary factors, from odd weather patterns to Donald Trump. "The trend of job growth has downshifted," says Stuart Hoffman, chief economist of PNC Financial Services Group. But Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, says Friday's meager total "significantly overstates the slowdown." Hoffman and Zandi agree that the 4.7% unemployment rate means there are fewer available workers to fill job openings, slowing hiring. Employers are struggling to find high-skilled workers in particular, a problem they've faced for several years because of mismatches between job requirements and the talents of laid-off employees. It looms larger amid a shrinking pool of workers. Lauren Griffin, senior vice president of Adecco Staffing, says employer demand and placements have remained strong. But she says it's tougher to find workers, particularly in fields such as technology and engineering, and so openings are taking longer to fill this year. Zandi expects monthly job growth to average 175,000 the rest of 2016. Hoffman forecasts average gains of 150,000. Yet economists also point to a hodgepodge of temporary forces that resulted in payroll advances of just 123,000 in April and 38,000 in May. Among them: Funky weather. High winter temperatures led employers to hire more workers early this year, especially in construction, retail and hotels, Zandi says. So they needed to hire less in April and May. Market turbulence. Financial markets have bounced back after stocks sold off and corporate borrowing costs spiked in January and February, but it takes time for firms to respond by reining in hiring and investment, Zandi says. Some big banks have brought on fewer workers because the market plunge doused mergers and initial public offerings, says Jeanne Branthover, of executive recruiting firm DHR International. "If they don't have as many deals, they don't need as many people," she says. Political uncertainty. Many businesses grow hesitant to hire because of the uncertainty generated by a presidential election. But Trump, the presumptive  GOP nominee, has intensified the paralysis, says Bernard Baumohl, of The Economic Outlook Group. Trump has called for imposing tariffs on China and lowering taxes, fomenting CEO fears of trade wars and bigger budget deficits, Baumohl says. Branthover says some financial service firms are conserving their 2016 hiring budgets and plan to add workers at year-end after the election clarifies the landscape. Weak economy. The labor market may finally be feeling the impact of a weak economy the past two quarters, says economist Scott Anderson of Bank of the West.  The good news: The economy is expected to rebound in the current quarter. 
December 6, 2016	USA TODAY	Former British prime minister Tony Blair warned that political upheaval -- from Great Britain's Brexit vote in June to the collapse of the Italian government Sunday -- signals the most dangerous time for Western democracies in decades. "It does feel perilous, actually, because I think there are decisions that are being taken of vast moment in circumstances where systems are fragile," he told Capital Download on Monday. "And that is troubling."  It has been a year of unexpected victories by populist and nationalistic forces challenging the establishment: passage of the referendum pulling Britain from the European Union, the election of Donald Trump as president in the USA, defeat of a measure in Italy that prompted the prime minister to announce his resignation. In an Austrian election Sunday, the candidate representing a party founded by former Nazis lost -- but after commanding 46% of the vote. Blair, who was in Washington to address a conference sponsored by the bipartisan group No Labels, announced last week the launch of an organization that will try to help build a more muscular policy agenda for centrists and encourage networking among them across Europe, in the USA and elsewhere. Given the rise of extreme voices on the left and right, he said, "I'm not sure we're asking the right questions right now, never mind giving the right answers." "It's amazing how many people you will find who will reference a style of leadership of (Russian) President Putin in a positive way," he told USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series. "I think people want their country moving, and they think that if the present system is not moving it and not making the changes that they want to see, then maybe someone who just says, 'I don't care what anyone thinks; I'm just going to go for it, and this is what I'm going to do' -- that has a certain attraction. "If the center isn't a place of strength and vitality, and it looks kind of flabby and just managing the status quo, then you're at risk of someone coming along and doing that." In his speech to the No Labels conference, he faulted some centrist political leaders for failing to  improve the economic prospects for workers disrupted by globalization and to ensure a sense of personal safety as Great Britain and other European countries have absorbed a wave of immigrants from Syria. "People will only put aside prejudices if they think there are rules," he said. Blair sees a common thread from the Brexit's passage to Trump's election to support for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, a provocative figure whose anti-drug campaign is blamed for thousands of deaths. "There is immense amount of anger at established ways of doing things," Blair said. "There is, I think, a whole group of people who feel ignored by those in power. ... There is more anger around in politics than for a long time." Though issues such as immigration aren't new, there is "much greater skepticism towards globalization and the benefits of it." What's more, "social media is a revolutionary phenomenon," he went on. "It changes the way politics works. It changes the way the media works. If we're not careful, it locks people into conversations with people who just agree with them and who then have a general conspiracy-theory view of the rest of the world." Blair hasn't met Trump and didn't criticize him. Asked whether it was wise for Trump to accept a congratulatory telephone call from Taiwan's president -- the sort of conversation every American president since 1979  has avoided to keep from angering China, which claims Taiwan as its territory -- Blair demurred. "I'm not going to get into your politics," he said. "To be honest, in the end, I'll tell you what I really think: Let's see how it works out. "I'm less worried about America than I am about Europe; I'll be very frank with you," he said. "America is such a strong country, and you've got so many checks-and-balances and you've got such resilience in your economy and so on; you guys will do fine, I'm sure. In Europe, we have systems that are at a point of fragility that troubles me." Blair was 54 years old when he moved out of No. 10 Downing St. after serving as prime minister from 1997 to 2007. His political appeal for a "new way" was akin to President Bill Clinton's "third way" for Democrats, and he was a crucial ally for President George W. Bush during the Iraq War. He offered a bit of free advice for President Obama, who will move out the White House next month at age 55: Find a cause. "When you've got young political leaders and then they leave office young, you've got to find something that really motivates you," he said. "The reason I spent so much time on the Middle East is that I'm deeply motivated by it. But you've got to find something that gets you up in the morning with the same sense of purpose and excitement as happened when you were prime minister or president." 
November 11, 2016	USA TODAY	Crossing President-elect Donald Trump's path is proving to be treacherous, and he's not even in office yet. Areas of the market Trump waged a war of words against -- especially tech firms, emerging markets including China, Brazil and Mexico and beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act -- are being hit on the stock market. These drubbings quantify just how different Trump's expected administration will be and how costly being on the wrong side appears. "Investors are already repositioning their portfolios in favor of what they view as Trump administration policies," says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at money management firm BMO Private Bank. "Seemingly quiet trading on the surface masks the turbulence that's going on underneath."  Investors already are taking Trump at his word to roll back long-standing policies toward free trade, health care reform and push for changes in the technology industry. Some of the areas to suffer already include: Technology stocks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been conspicuously left out of the market's rally since Trump's victory.  The Nasdaq 100, an index of the largest non-financial stocks in the Nasdaq, is down 1.2% since the Trump election, lagging the 1.3% rally by the broader Standard & Poor's 500 and 2.6% rise by the Dow Jones industrial average. Trump has routinely fingered technology firms as a source of job losses and low tax rates. Amazon.com (AMZN) has especially been in Trump's cross hairs. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post, which has been a steady critic of Trump. Trump has accused Amazon of controlling too much of domestic commerce and paying too little in taxes. Shares of Amazon.com are down 5.8% since Trump won the election, making it the 13th-worst-performing stock in the Nasdaq 100. Bezos on Thursday tweeted a congratulations to Trump. But Amazon.com isn't alone as Apple (AAPL) has been targeted by Trump due to its heavy reliance on overseas manufacturing. Apple is down 3% since the election. Emerging markets. Trump has routinely railed against several of the U.S. international trade pacts, stating these deals put other nations at a bigger advantage than the U.S. Investors expect revisions to these trade agreements that could slow down trade with other countries. That belief is priced into various emerging markets stocks. The Vanguard Emerging Markets exchange-traded fund sank 5.5% over the past few days. Not all emerging nations will be hurt equally, according to research by money management firm Causeway Capital. "The disposal or renegotiation of trade deals would disproportionally hurt those economies with a significant dependence on exports such as Taiwan, India, South Korea and Mexico," the report says. "We expect more domestically focused economies, such as China, Thailand and Indonesia, to be less affected." Hospitals. Trump's effect on health care is largely yet to be determined, but investors are already assuming the worst for hospitals. Seeing the repeal of Obamacare will likely increase the number of uninsured patients going to hospitals, which will be a cost for them. Tenet Healthcare (THC) is the second-worst-performing stock in the S&P 1500 since Trump won, declining 28%. In fact, health care facilities companies account for four of the 15 worst-performing stocks since the election, which is more than any other industry. Investors' fears may prove overblown, though.  Trump's plans to lower corporate tax rates might encourage tech companies holding cash overseas to bring it to the U.S. and boost dividends. 
December 13, 2016	USA TODAY	Wednesday, top tech CEOs are expected to sit down with president-elect Donald Trump in New York to discuss what remains a mystery: how the new administration will treat the nation's high-tech engine. But at least one confirmed attendee -- Telsa CEO Elon Musk -- may be more eager for a sit-down with Trump's Transportation secretary nominee, Elaine Chao. As the new head of the DOT, replacing outgoing secretary Anthony Foxx, Chao, 63, would take the wheel of a department just as it was beginning to corral the players shaping our self-driving car future under a cohesive national plan.  And there's evidence this future-tech needs federal oversight: last week, Michigan became the first state to approve testing of self-driving cars with no safety drivers at the wheel, raising the prospect of a vehicle being legal in one state and illegal in another. Although Chao's public service record is extensive, her leadership tenure as Labor secretary and at the head of organizations such as the United Way and the Peace Corps doesn't shed much light on how she would rule on autonomous driving issues. In September, Foxx released a book-length document that served as the Obama administration's endorsement of self-driving cars as a safe and environmentally friendly alternative to human-piloted machines, which kill some 30,000 people a year. In stark contrast, the 2016 Republican platform chastises the current administration for "its ill-named Livability Initiative (that) is meant to 'coerce people out of their cars.'" "She could in theory, but everyone recognizes this is going to happen one way or the other," says Paul Mackie, spokesman for Mobility Lab, a publicly funded research institute that provides information about transportation alternatives and solutions. Mackie suggests that Chao's role is more as "cheerleader" given that many of the nitty gritty decisions about how municipalities go about solving mobility challenges remain at the state and local level. The nation is facing one of its biggest shifts in transportation with the advent of self-driving cars, and the federal government is likely to help shape this rapidly approaching reality. A longtime Republican and Capitol Hill stalwart, Chao, 63, served two terms as Labor secretary under George W. Bush, after which she returned to a post at the conservative Heritage Foundation and provided commentary for Fox News. She is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, another longtime fixture of the GOP. In a few 2015 speeches at the American Action Forum, Chao offered a glimpse into her views on both transportation and labor matters. She praised ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft -- which also are working on autonomous vehicles -- and the opportunities they provide employees of the so-called gig economy. "At a minimum, government policies must not stifle the innovation that has made this sector such an explosive driver of job growth and opportunity," Chao said. That said, Uber and Lyft have been sued by drivers in cities such as San Francisco and New York; the drivers say they should be treated as employees, not independent contractors. Uber has strongly defended the contractor designation while rolling out perks to drivers, like access to retirement plans. While DOT secretary, Chao would not have jurisdiction over such matters; she could use her position to influence whoever lands in her old post of Labor secretary, suggests Jim Evans, attorney with the labor and employment group at Alston & Bird. "She could influence if not directly than indirectly," Evans says. "There's the potential for DOT and Labor appointees to bless the independent contractor models that these companies rely on." Evans says to do otherwise would likely spell the end of Uber and Lyft. Although there are no specifics on either company's business model, many experts assume the prodigious amount of capital raised by a company such as Uber -- $16 billion so far at a valuation of $69 billion -- is being spent largely to subsidize rides. A quick look at how Chao may rule on broader transportation issues can be gleaned from the 2016 Republican Platform, which laments that a good deal of DOT funding is incorrectly used for bike-share programs, sidewalks, recreational trails, landscaping and historical renovations. And it comes down firm on the issue of expensive high-speed rail initiatives: "We reaffirm our intention to end federal support for boondoggles like California's high-speed train to nowhere." Chao may want to revisit that  smackdown of high-speed rail, considering the numerous times candidate Trump praised China's sleek mass-transit bullets. "They have trains that go 300 miles per hour," the billionaire exclaimed on a campaign stop last March. "We have trains that go chug ... chug ... chug." 
March 9, 2016	USA TODAY	Iran has plagued six presidents since revolutionaries overran the U.S. Embassy and took Americans hostage in Tehran in 1979, and it will be one of the hardest diplomatic challenges for the next president as well. The nation is a regional troublemaker, the sworn enemy of U.S. allies Israel and Saudi Arabia, and a key backer of Syria's Bashar Assad. A year or even six months ago, there was real fear that Iran's determination to build nuclear weapons would erupt into war. That war didn't happen is a tribute to cooler heads on both sides, and it's the right context for thinking about the entire bumpy road to whatever new relationship the U.S. and Iran are working out. As bad as things are, they could be a lot worse.  That's also the appropriate perspective for assessing Iran's recent elections. They didn't change the fundamental nature of the country's leadership or Iran's determination to direct events in its neighborhood.  Hard-liners still control the military, the courts and key sectors of the economy. Even so -- and this is the good news -- the election was another modest step in the right direction for moderates, who gained scores of new seats in Iran's parliament. Two particularly hard-line members of the Assembly of Experts, the body that will someday pick the next supreme leader, were voted out of office. "Moderate" is, of course, a relative term in Iranian politics, where many reformers are dead, imprisoned, exiled or simply barred from running for office. Yet these election results are far preferable to ones that could have produced  more hard-line refusal to engage with the West or stick to last year's nuclear agreement, which traded away for at least a decade Iran's plans to build a bomb in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Into this fragile, complicated situation step the two leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination. Ted Cruz vows to "rip" the Iran nuclear accord "to shreds" on his first day in the Oval Office. Donald Trump says that if he's president, he'll renegotiate the "insane" bargain that was worked out by "stupid, incompetent" people in the Obama administration. Cruz's tough talk about tearing up the deal wouldn't just signal that the U.S. can't be trusted to stand by its word from one administration to the next; it ignores the fact that the accord wasn't made only by the U.S. but also by Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China -- all of which helped apply the tough sanctions that finally brought Iran to the table. Trump's blithe claim that he could get a better deal probably either amuses or alarms those other countries, which have said that they won't restart talks if the U.S. unilaterally backs out. For its part, Iran has been as good as its word so far. It shipped 98% of its enriched uranium out of the country, mothballed most of its centrifuges and poured cement into the core of a reactor that could have created bomb-making plutonium. None of this means Iran is turning into a responsible actor on the world stage, but U.S. voters should beware of candidates who'd renege on American commitments and offer simplistic approaches to complex problems. 
May 5, 2016	USA TODAY	Talk of the market maybe making new highs has given way to talk of the Nasdaq nearing correction territory, or a 10% drop from its high. Talk of the broad Standard & Poor's 500 stock index in danger of sinking back into the red again for the year. And talk of the Dow's year-to-date gains dwindling as well. The changing narrative can be blamed on the Nasdaq finishing lower nine of the past 10 sessions. On iPhone maker Apple for posting earnings that fell shy of Wall Street expectations. On China's economy still not firing on all cylinders. On the Japanese yuan and the euro actually rising in value despite the fact both central banks  are easing -- not tightening -- monetary policy. Some investors also blame unpredictable Donald Trump, who surprised everyone and appears to have locked up the Republican presidential nomination despite warning of a coming recession, talking up a coming trade war with China and a wall-building exercise on the U.S.-Mexican border,  a few things that could worry investors at home and abroad. The market is showing signs of fatigue. After back-to-back losses, the Nasdaq kicks off Thursday's session 9.5% below its record high and in danger of falling into correction territory. The S&P 500 is up just 0.4% for the year. Investors should be watching to see if the market can reverse its fall. 
September 6, 2016	USA TODAY	A brewing controversy awaited President Obama as he arrived Monday because of "colorful" comments from outspoken Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.  The firebrand Duterte, who has been compared to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, warned Obama not to question him about his country's extrajudicial killings in a war on drugs. More than 2,000 suspected drug users and dealers have died since Duterte took office June 30. Duterte said Obama must not throw questions at him, or "son of a bitch, I will swear at you in that forum," the Associated Press reported. "Clearly, he's a colorful guy," Obama said Monday when asked about the comment at a news conference after the Group of 20 summit in Hangzhou, China. Before he left China, Obama said he would ask his staff to determine if a planned meeting with Duterte would still be productive. The White House later announced that Obama will not meet with Duterte and instead will have a one-on-one session with South Korean President Park Geun Hye on Monday afternoon. 
November 3, 2016	USA TODAY	The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate steady Wednesday and left the door open to a December rate hike amid an improving economy. In a statement after a two-day meeting, the Fed said it decided to keep its federal funds rate at a historically low 0.4%.  The Fed said "the case for a rate increase strengthened," but policymakers decided, "for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives." That largely mirrored the September statement, except the Fed added that only "some" advances are needed, suggesting a rate hike may be at hand. The statement added that "inflation has increased somewhat since earlier this year" and removed its previous assertion that "inflation is expected to remain low in the near term." The Fed's preferred measure of annual inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, is still below its 2% annual target, but it has edged up steadily this year, reaching 1.7% recently. That could pave the way for a rate hike as soon as December. Stocks, already on pace for a seventh day of losses, fell further after the statement but shortly began staging a recovery. Some economists said the Fed was unlikely to send an explicit signal of a December rate increase similar to a reference in October 2015 to a possible hike at the "next meeting." With markets already pricing in an increase anyway, Fed officials would prefer not to close off their options, economists said. Among potential shocks are a contested presidential election next week or a victory by Republican Donald Trump that roils markets, economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics says. After Wednesday's statement was released, fed fund futures reckoned there was a 72% chance the Fed will lift its benchmark rate at a Dec. 13-14 meeting, up from 68% a day earlier. It was unlikely the Fed would act just days before the election, potentially disrupting markets and coloring perceptions of the economy and presidential candidates Trump and Hillary Clinton. The Fed has stood pat since raising its federal funds rate in December for the first time in nine years, citing factors such as China's economic slowdown, the United Kingdom's Brexit vote,  volatile markets and a spring slump in U.S. job growth. 
April 5, 2016	USA TODAY	President Obama met last week with leaders from Japan, South Korea and China to discuss nuclear threats from North Korea. The biggest danger of Kim Jong Un having nukes is not him placing them on missiles but him giving them to IslamicState terrorists. - Vincent Wolf  Unfortunately, we will have to wait for the next president to decide what to do with North Korea. This one will do zero. - Frank Wilson Harding Doing nothing is better than starting a nuclear war with a deranged dictator. Hopefully, the next president will be as tactful as our current one. What would you prefer, another quagmire war that creates another ISIL? - Andrew Jason Neumann Even if North Koreans had the ability to hit Washington with a nuclear warhead, they would never do it. China has them on a leash, and their military is half-starved. Kim knows well that if he ever attacked Seoul or Washington, it would be the end of the Kim regime. I pretty much think the American people can rest their heads at night without worrying about Kim actually going ahead with his threats. I, for one, will. - Matthew Pettipas North Korea is the most dangerous threat to U.S. national security. The country is run by an isolated kook whose main political agenda appears to be  destroying the USA. - Christopher Dunn Source Gallup Poll conducted Feb. 3-7 of 1,021 adults nationwide. Margin of error is ±4 percentage points. I'm no psychologist, but common sense tells me that the first step in doing something is to say you're going to do it. It seems that if a pipsqueak is ignored, he will only increase his misbehavior in order to gain our attention so as to be recognized as one of the big boys ("Obama, Asian leaders huddle on region's concerns," News, Friday). Threats should always be taken seriously (especially from crazy people). I'd say, because we can't send Kim Jong Un to bed without dinner, we stomp on him like a grape. In the words of that great philosopher Barney After the Nuclear Security Summit, we asked  followers to share their  security concerns regarding nukes. What if Trump should actually get control of our nukes? People should think long and hard about that one.
May 20, 2016	USA TODAY	Often what upends the stock market is when potential bad stuff that investors know about -- but underestimate and don't sufficiently guard against -- happens. Wall Street doesn't like surprises. Case in point: the stock market's negative reaction to Wednesday's surprise announcement by the Federal Reserve that a June interest rate hike is still on the table if the economy perks up in the current quarter.  A possible increase in borrowing costs just four weeks from now was "not priced into the market." Investors were caught off guard, and their portfolios were positioned for a very different interest rate scenario. In fact, Wall Street at the start of the week was pricing in a nearly 0% probability of a June hike. Since the release of the minutes of the Fed's April meeting, investors are now pricing in a 1-in-4 chance of a hike. And that raises the question: What other risks are investors downplaying that could end up blowing a hole in their portfolios? Three Fed rate increases in 2016 would catch investors way offsides, says Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. "The market is unprepared for that aggressive of a Fed move," Luschini told USA TODAY. The worry is the Fed  makes a policy mistake that will tip the fragile U.S. economy into recession. 2.A real-life "Brexit." Britain leaving the 28-country European Union is a real possibility. But Wall Street is betting the Brits will vote "no" June 23 and opt to stay. If investors are wrong and a Brexit happens, markets could turn tumultuous, perhaps causing more havoc than had Greece voted to leave the eurozone, warns Nick Sargen, senior investment adviser at Fort Washington Investment Advisors. Wall Street still sees Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton -- a well-known entity -- winning the presidential election in November. But Republican front-runner Donald Trump could surprise everyone again and take the White House. "Americans do not realize how terrible his image is to those outside the U.S.," he says. "Therefore, I would expect considerable foreign selling of U.S. securities over time, especially if he continued his threat about a trade war with China." One Wall Street pro says the biggest surprise could actually be to the upside, as markets are pricing in nothing but doom and gloom at the moment, says Richard Bernstein, CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors. 
August 25, 2016	USA TODAY	With stock indexes in record territory and a 71/2-year bull market chugging along, investors are worried. The U.S. employment market is back to churning out 200,000-plus jobs each month, and the real estate market is filled with willing buyers of new homes. "It doesn't take a lot to derail the market; if anything goes wrong, swings in the stock market can be pretty pronounced," says Savita Subramanian, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "Our call is for a 30% chance of a meaningful correction of up to 20%; it's not our base case, but it's a reasonable case." September is the worst month of performance for the Dow Jones industrial average in the past 50 and 100 years, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The market is assuming Democrat Hillary Clinton will win the November election. But it may be too early to count out Republican Donald Trump. Polls vary widely. A sampling of recent surveys, which all show Clinton in the lead, puts the two candidates as few as 4 points apart and as many as 12. If polls after Labor Day show Clinton with only a 2- or 3-point lead, "it could inject a mood of uncertainty into markets, which seemingly are convinced Trump can't win," says Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments and respected political and policy market analyst. A Trump presidency, he says, would raise fears of a trade war with China, economic policy uncertainty and geopolitical instability. "She's (Clinton) still the favorite, but it's premature to anoint her," Valliere warns, saying investors will have to wait until after the first debate Sept. 26 before "reaching any definitive conclusions." The $45 to $50 level seen in the most recent rebound rally in the oil patch might not stick, with lower prices again spooking investors. U.S.-produced crude was down nearly 2% early Wednesday to $47.20 per barrel. "Sub-$40 per barrel oil impacts everything," says Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service. "It creates problems for frackers, hurts employment and negatively impacts the ability of energy companies to make profits." Some market bulls are counting on the energy sector going from a big drag on the earnings of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index to a net positive in the second half of this year and next. "Oil below $40 would put that assumption into question," Warren says. The Fed -- based on recent comments from a handful of members -- keeps saying a rate hike is coming. If Yellen hints strongly of a sooner-than-expected rate increase -- perhaps as early as September -- during her speech Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyo., it could roil markets, as investors aren't expecting any rate hike until at least December. A rate increase likely would boost the value of the dollar, which would hurt earnings of U.S. multinationals and pressure oil prices. Wall Street may be too optimistic in its forecast for corporate earnings growth and overall economic growth, which could set the market up for disappointment, Subramanian says. "We're leery of the lofty expectations," she says, adding the market is pricing in 14% profit growth for the S&P 500 in 2017, or double the 7% her firm is forecasting. She also says the "hope" bar is raised too high for fiscal spending by governments around the globe to bail out markets. 
November 23, 2016	USA TODAY	President-elect Donald Trump's economic plan is expected to give a boost to business, which has been pressured by what some consider a tight regulatory environment and high corporate taxes. The potential for a rollback in regulation and a corporate tax rate of 15% are reasons the stock market has reacted so positively to Trump's plans. But what about entrepreneurs and emerging businesses? Will this area still be the growth story it has been? And where will the jobs and growth come from in coming years? I caught up with serial entrepreneur Jessica Herrin, CEO and founder of Stella & Dot (and before that weddingchannel.com in the 1990s). Herrin has created what she calls a modern-day Mary Kay, where she relies on specialists or stylists to get her accessories to customers.  A: I first started my career in technology and quickly realized  you could create professional success without really creating impact and happiness. And I became motivated to start another business that would really make a difference on something I was passionate about, and that was creating more flexible work for women. I began in my living room while I had another full-time job, and I was pregnant and wanted to reinvent what the on-the-go business opportunity could be for the modern woman that would be about great product, use of technology and really putting profits in your pocket by reinventing the model. A: Stella & Dot is a family of brands that has grown into two accessories brands, Stella & Dot and KEEP Collective. And we're also a platform that launched a skincare brand.  With Stella & Dot, we've taken a couture design process and applied that to affordable luxury. So half of our product line is under $50, and it really is style made simple. Our stylists are really a personal shopper that help girlfriends who get together and try it on at home, or shop online ... for that busy woman who wants to look pulled together but needs a little help. KEEP is a more memory-based line which makes the ultimate personalized gift and is  a keepsake. Our skincare brand is creating a good-for-you product that gives results. A: Wedding Channel had a very non-sexy start. I was working at a tech company that was bringing together price and availability information to help make assembling computers easier. I applied that basic thought to bring together the information of where people were registered for wedding gifts and make it easy for people to shop for that online. This was during the birth of e-commerce. So instead of having consumers go into a store, they could easily check out in minutes by searching a couple's name, finding the different stores they were registered in and purchase a wedding gift. So it was really about taking technology and creating a very simple solution to a large-market customer problem. A: I just wrote a book, Find Your Extraordinary, that chronicles my entrepreneurial journey. And it really talks about the entrepreneurial spirit. Because for most people, having an idea, or even access to capital, isn't enough. It's about the motivation and will to be tenacious enough to actually get an idea off the ground and turn it into a viable business. Every overnight success story takes seven to 10 years. It's harder than you think. For me, I had to drop out of business school and raise venture capital, and that's how I started Wedding Channel. I was very convinced that I wanted to do Stella & Dot differently so that I could keep control of the mission and run the business for impact instead of profits. That meant that I had to bootstrap. I had another full-time job, and I didn't take a (Stella & Dot) paycheck for six years. You have to stick with it. It's about finding the right people that can partner with you, who are experts in the area that you need to know about. And then it's about being productive and getting the right things done. A: I went back to the people that had been on my board at Wedding Channel. That was productive because we had a working relationship, so they invested seed capital into this business. It's definitely a Silicon Valley anomaly that we spent $2 million to get to profitability. And that's compared to the hundreds of millions other companies of our size have raised, and they're not necessarily even at profitability yet. I wanted to fund the business off of sales growth and not be in the business of turning a dollar into a dime but really doing something  sustainable. And that took bootstrapping. It took a lot of sacrifice. But it was worth it because now our business isn't about who needs a liquidity event and who's trying to post profits for the quarter for Wall Street. It's truly about serving our business owners and making an impact on the workplace for women. A: I had invested myself and was funding the business until I brought in partners. I think our seed round of capital was about $250,000. And that was maybe a year or so into the business when we already were generating about that much in revenue. As we went to grow and hire people, then we needed to raise another couple of million dollars. A: Bringing in people and partners is essential for success. And I needed other people to care and have skin in the game. So I didn't think about it as giving up ownership. I thought about it as gaining another person who cared as much as I did about driving the business to succeed in order to serve the mission. And if you pick the right partners, you're gonna feel that way too. So to escalate my own commitment, I paced getting that investment around the birth of my two daughters and knowing that I was ready to commit to other people around the trajectory of the business. I've always looked at my partners as welcome seats at the table who care as much as I do and are equally responsible for creating the success. Blythe Harris, who's the chief creative officer, joined a couple years into the business and became a partner. She also invested in the business. And that was essential for our success. A: Each of our three brands is only at the beginning stages of its market potential. We're very focused on broadening our impact on how many people we help earn flexible income, often on top of another full-time job.  So our focus is using our three brands in the six countries that we're in to capture all the untapped demand that's out there for the $30 billion accessory market in North America and the multibillion-dollar skincare market, where we feel we really have disruptive products people love. Our sellers drive their business through social media and mobile technologies as much as they do person-to-person contact. And we have a very pro-profit model for them in which there are no quotas; they're not carrying inventory. We ship direct to the customer. We offer free returns and guarantee  quality. So we really make this business something that works when they work it, and they can do that at their own pace. A: Yes, and just over 50,000 independent business owners that work across one of our family of brands. And we produce our goods in the U.S. and in Asia. And it really depends on what type of artistry we're using. So you'll do embroidery in India. Our skincare products are made and billed in the United States. And some of our jewelry is made in Vietnam, China and Thailand, based on skill. As an entrepreneur, you're not an expert in everything. But if you're a creator, you've got to be a connector of experts to your mission. So it's about going out and meeting as many people as you can and finding the best people that are experts in marketing or production or technology or whatever balance of skill you need as an entrepreneur. I really understood technology and company building and marketing and sales, but I needed someone to help with product design and production processes and (working with) individual business owners. So I went out and sought that expertise in partners. And then they had a network of people that were experts. Q: Do you expect the Trump administration's economic plan to have an impact on your business? Lower taxes and lower regulations? A: Well, we're also potentially expecting tariffs to go up. So we're in a "let's see what actually comes to fruition and gets put into law versus what might have been part of a campaign rhetoric" mode. I believe in what we do and why we do it. I believe people need flexible income. So from our perspective, I'm optimistic about continued growth because we make great products and we do it for a great reason. From a general economy perspective, I believe when you lower corporate taxes you give businesses the ability to invest. So if businesses are operating responsibly and they're focused on job creation in the U.S., that will be good for the economy.

December 13, 2016	USA TODAY	China said Monday it has "serious concern" about comments by Donald Trump regarding the  island of Taiwan. The  reaction came a day after the president-elect said he did not feel "bound by a one-China policy."  China warned that any changes to U.S. dealings with Taiwan could damage  relations between Beijing and Washington. The United States sees Taiwan as part of China and maintains a formal relationship with China and an unofficial one with the island. On Fox News, Trump said, "I fully understand the one-China policy, but I don't know why we have to be bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade." Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, said established policy is the "political foundation" of any diplomatic relationship between China and the United States, the Associated Press reported. "We urge the new U.S. leader and government to fully understand the seriousness of the Taiwan issue and to continue to stick to the one-China policy," Geng said. The Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, said in an editorial Monday that Trump was "as ignorant as a child." Last week, Taiwan's leader Tsai Ing-wen said a  phone call between her and Trump on Dec. 2 did not signal a change in policy. 
January 6, 2017	USA TODAY	President-elect Donald Trump's use of Twitter to bypass media curation has merits that are likely to make such communication characteristic of modern politics. Twitter offers little scope for elaboration, especially by a political figure who has not yet assumed office. Still, it is difficult to find any basis for the over-the-top emotional response by critics.  Let's look at what the president-elect accomplished by his remarks, and assess the evidence that may have contributed to its timing. On Dec. 21, the president-elect met with the nation's senior military leadership, including officers with responsibility for managing our nuclear deterrent; he got an earful. On Dec. 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with his senior military leadership for their annual review of Russia's defense capabilities and future needs. Putin said, "It is necessary to strengthen the combat potential of the strategic nuclear forces." On Dec. 22, the president-elect responded to Putin: the U.S. "must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes"; and reinforced his commitment to sustaining the credibility of the U.S. nuclear "umbrella" in saying the next day, "Let it be an arms race. ... We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all." The most important diplomatic achievement of the nuclear era is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The treaty stopped the proliferation of nuclear weapons by allies because they were convinced that the U.S. would provide a nuclear "umbrella." China has multiplied its number of warheads five times in the past decade, and Russia is poised for a vast "breakout' from two to five times or more of its number of warheads after New START ends in 2021. Trump reassured Asian and European allies of the reliability of the U.S. nuclear "umbrella" as have his predecessors. The U.S. would not allow the vast Chinese and Russian nuclear modernization to undermine their commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
November 21, 2016	USA TODAY	A federal banking regulator has imposed tighter restrictions on Wells Fargo & Co., requiring the banking giant to get advance approval from regulators before making a wide range of business decisions. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will require the bank to get prior approval before making changes in its board of directors and senior executive officers.  China, Mexico and several U.S. allies took aim at Donald Trump's protectionist views on global trade at a summit of Asian-Pacific leaders in Peru on Saturday. Chinese President Xi Jinping said the best response to rising protectionism would be for the 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to negotiate a free trade area encompassing the entire Pacific Rim. 
December 12, 2016	USA TODAY	Boeing has government approval to fill Iran Air's $16 billion aircraft order, but it may still be grounded by Congress. And President-elect Donald Trump, who has criticized the Iran nuclear accord that allowed the deal to take off, could eventually have a say, too.  The Chicago-headquartered Boeing said Sunday that it will sell 80 jetliners worth $16.6 billion to Iran Air. Boeing got approval to sell planes in Iran in September but had to wait for a license for the Iran Air deal from the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. This would be the largest business deal that a U.S. company had done with Iran since President Obama signed an executive order lifting sanctions against the country. That order came after Iran agreed to end its pursuit of nuclear weapons under an accord reached in July 2015 with the United Nations Security Council members -- the U.S., Britain, China, France and Russia -- and Germany. But Boeing's deal could face opposition in Congress and the White House. "We will aggressively fight this deal in next Congress, though we probably won't even need new legislation to do it," said David Pasch, communications director for Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill. In May, Roskam, along with fellow Illinois Republican Reps. Robert Dold and Randy Hultgren, sent a letter to Boeing asking the company not to do business with Iran until it renounces support for terror groups. Last month, the House of Representatives approved a bill that would prevent the Treasury Department from giving U.S. banks the licenses to help Boeing complete the transactions. Since Obama would likely veto the bill, it hasn't moved in the Senate. 
January 10, 2017	USA TODAY	Mars, the candy giant which also backs key pet food brands such as Pedigree and Whiskas, has initiated a roughly $9.1billion deal to buy pet health care provider VCA.  Mars, maker of Snickers, M&M's and Wrigley's  gum,  has a firm stake in the world of pet care, owning Banfield Pet Hospital and several pet food brands. .  McDonald's is handing over an 80% stake in its China-based restaurants to a team that includes the nation's biggest conglomerate. The roughly $2.1billion deal will form a  company that will link McDonald's with CITIC Limited, a Chinese company with businesses that include manufacturing, financial services and real estate. The marketers of nationally advertised dietary supplement Prevagen have been sued by the Federal Trade Commission and New York State attorney general's office for allegedly making false claims the product improves memory and is "clinically shown" to work. A federal court complaint  filed Monday charges  marketers relied on a study that failed to show it works better than a placebo. Martin Shkreli, the pharmaceutical industry entrepreneur  indicted on charges of securities fraud, had his Twitter account suspended Sunday after he  harassed a female journalist online. Lauren Duca, a freelancer  whose work has appeared in "Teen Vogue" and other publications, tweeted Thursday a screen shot of a direct Twitter message from Shkreli, in which he invited her to be his date to President-elect  Trump's inauguration.  Shkreli  posted several photos of her on his Twitter banner and used a doctored photo, showing Duca sitting on a sofa, as his  profile image. Sunday, Duca grabbed a screenshot of Shkreli's Twitter page -- along with a message, "How is this allowed" -- and tweeted it to CEO Jack Dorsey. 
April 11, 2016	USA TODAY	There is a huge body of evidence showing the power of so-called index funds -- that is, mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that are tied to a stock market index such as the S&P 500. Last year, two-thirds of investment managers who handpicked large stocks did worse than if they simply put their money into the fixed list of S&P 500 components.  The long-term data are even more compelling, with 82% of active funds underperforming index funds over the past 10 years. Still, for many investors, a plain vanilla approach to investing via index funds isn't enough. Whether it's the allure of being in the minority  achieving outperformance or whether it's a specific financial situation in their household that demands a different approach, many Americans are looking for something different than simply a "set it and forget it" approach with index funds. A good investment portfolio is always diversified, of course, something experts all recommend. In addition, they advise against risky bets that can bankrupt you if they go south. That said, a few strategic moves in a portfolio can make a big difference -- particularly when used in concert with index funds that form the foundation of your retirement strategy. Quality often trumps quantity in these situations, and allocating just a little bit of your nest egg toward smart picks can really pay off in the long run. If you have a substantial amount of savings already, you should be very proud of your saving strategy. And you also should consider looking for stable investments to protect that nest egg in a choppy market, said Chuck Self, a chief investment officer at ETF investment strategist of iSectors in Appleton, Wis. That's why he recommends the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), which yields about 2.4% right now. "The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF is a great option for investors looking to combat slowed growth (for the U.S. economy) and provide diversification for their portfolios," Self said. He added that "Treasuries are attractive to foreign investors, too," given slowing global growth rates and the fact that U.S. government bonds are the world's safe haven investment. Some investors may be leery of long-term bonds, given talk about the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates and the fact that when rates rise, the principal value of bonds can drop. However, Self pointed out that the Fed has been very subdued in its interest rate plan, including a move in March to dial down expectations for future rate increases. In fact, he doesn't see any rate increases at all this calendar year. "With continued slow economic growth, low inflation expectations and the presidential elections coming up, the only opportunity to raise rates would be December, and we expect the economic growth and inflation expectations will be too low to raise rates then," he said. It's no secret that there is a lot of turmoil in global markets lately, particularly with China's economy slowing last year to grow at the slowest pace in 25 years. But long-term investors should see the recent downturn in emerging markets as an opportunity to buy into these regions at depressed prices, said Mariann Montagne, senior investment analyst at Gradient Investments in Arden Hills, Minn. She recommends the First Trust Chindia ETF (FNI) for investors who can stomach the short-term volatility overseas in pursuit of long-term outperformance. This ETF is focused only on companies domiciled in China and India, two emerging markets with some of the biggest potential for future growth. "We believe China's economic growth will remain in the 6% to 7% range for the next few years, while India's will continue its top position at slightly better than 7% growth," Montagne said. "We believe earnings expectations have been set low for each country, and financial reforms are on the rise." Montagne adds that a diversified emerging markets fund like FNI also offers a bit more stability than picking individual companies in these far-flung regions, which can be very risky for individual investors. For many investors, the day-to-day volatility of the stock market can take a big emotional toll. Even if they know academically that a good strategy is to buy and hold for the long term, the roller coaster ride of their portfolio and the 24-hour crush of headlines can simply be too much. That's where the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV) comes in. This exchange-traded fund avoids stocks that are trading for a premium above their current profit levels and is weighted toward defensive consumer picks instead of more volatile sectors of the stock market. "It has a low expense ratio and has zero technology and zero energy exposure, limiting risk," said Ron Weiner, founder and president of RDM Financial Group in Westport, Conn. "This is a good all-weather fund. We feel that we are currently in a trading range where stocks are not cheap, and we don't see a catalyst to spur significant growth." There isn't as much explosive potential, of course, but it's an appropriate investment for those who are willing to forfeit big swings up in order to prevent big swings down. And 2016 seems a particularly appropriate time for this fund, Weiner adds, given the "dull market" where today's big winners don't seem to have much staying power. Investors are increasingly turning to exchange traded funds, or ETFs. Of the 318 different ETFs offered at the end of 2014, here's how they break down.
June 27, 2016	USA TODAY	Before last Friday, many Americans paid scant attention to the vote in the United Kingdom, on the far side of a big ocean, over whether to pull out of the European Union or stay put.  That all changed when Britain shocked the world by voting to leave. Global financial markets tumbled, dragging down Americans' retirement accounts with them. Prime Minister David Cameron announced he would resign in a few months, and Scottish officials pressed for another vote on breaking with the UK. Yes, many Britons had good reason to loathe the EU. It has a stupefying bureaucracy, it coddles debt-laden countries such as Greece, and its 28-member structure makes for a kitchen with too many cooks. But the negative consequences of the "Brexit" vote are hard to overestimate. Britain, or what is left of it, will be considerably more isolated and marginalized. That's not good news for it, or for the United States, which counts the UK an important strategic ally. An EU without Britain, the world's fifth largest economy, will be less market-oriented and less amenable to American positions. A Britain without the EU will struggle to remain relevant on issues such as combating terrorism, standing up to Russia and finding an appropriate relationship between China and the West. Brexit supporters capitalized on the anti-globalization movements that have gained considerable strength in recent years by going after trade, immigration, and to, some degree, technology. In the USA and abroad, and on the left and the right, these movements have tapped into a sense that the change brought by these forces is detrimental. Those on the other side, meanwhile, have found it hard to convince people of the advantages of globalization. But the fallout from the Brexit vote -- political turmoil, an instant 11% shrinkage in the British economy measured in U.S. dollars, and a potential 11% reduction in the UK population if Scotland and Northern Ireland leave -- demonstrates the price to be paid for disengagement. There are lessons from Britain's vote for the United States. Fortunately, Americans don't need to chose between a foreign-based bureaucracy or turning inward. But they do need to know that erecting immigration and trade walls (literal or figurative), in a nationalistic backlash against globalization, is bad business. Immigration reform in this country would be a boon to the U.S. economy, as undocumented workers come out of the shadows to start businesses, go to school, take more demanding jobs and pay taxes. Yet reform remains bottled up in Congress, while a much-needed trade deal with 11 Pacific rim countries faces highly uncertain prospects. The Republican Party, for its part, appears set to nominate a virulently anti-trade, anti-immigration presidential candidate in Donald Trump. Trump, in Scotland on Friday to visit his golf course in Turnberry, quickly drew "a big parallel" between Brexit and his own campaign. "I love to see people take their country back," he said. Voters on this side of the pond would do well to look at the turmoil created by the vote in the UK. In a complex and vibrant world, isolation is never  good. 
September 9, 2016	USA TODAY	Across the USA, this has been a summer straight out of a James Taylor song: We've seen fire, and we've seen rain. And we've seen sunny days that we thought would never end.  Wildfires out West. Record flooding in Greenbrier County, W.Va., in June, Ellicott City, Md., in July and Baton Rouge, La., in August. Endless sunshine in drought-stricken parts of Southern California. We've also seen plenty of record heat, both at home and abroad. In July, Earth's temperature, boosted by climate change and a fading El Niño, reached its highest point since instrumental record-keeping began 136 years ago. On Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the U.S. recorded hotter nights in June, July and August than in any summer since record-keeping began in 1895. In the Arctic, summer ice has melted so much that the Crystal Serenity cruise ship is traversing the famed Northwest Passage on a 32-day trip from Seward, Alaska, to New York City. Melting ice sheets and expanding ocean waters are causing sea levels to rise, prompting more frequent "clear sky flooding" in Miami,  Norfolk and other East Coast cities. All of this provides further evidence, as if any were needed, that global warming is a here-and-now problem, not something to worry about in the distant future. No, no single extreme weather event can be conclusively attributed to human-induced climate change. But this summer's weather anomalies are entirely consistent with what scientists and computer models predict about a warming world. The science of heavy rain events is  straightforward: Warmer atmospheres and ocean surfaces produce more evaporation and more water vapor in the atmosphere to fuel rainstorms. According to the National Climate Assessment, heavy rain events increased 71% in the northeast U.S. from 1958 to 2012.  And, on Wednesday, a new federal report concluded that human-caused climate change played a "measurable" role in last month's catastrophic flooding in Louisiana and increases the chances of such torrential downpours by at least 40%. For the future of the world, the most significant news over Labor Day weekend wasn't the latest on Hillary Clinton's emails or Donald Trump's visit to a black church. It was the agreement of President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping -- leaders of the two leading emitting nations -- to work together on December's Paris accord to reduce greenhouse gases. The initial round of Paris pledges won't be nearly enough to meet the target of keeping the planet well below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit of warming. But the pledges, if kept, might be enough to head off the most cataclysmic scenarios. There's plenty of room for debate on the best ways to adapt to climate change, mitigate its effects and curtail greenhouse-gas emissions. After another long, hot, soggy summer, however, neither Trump nor any other candidate for public office should be allowed to get away with the argument that climate change is a "hoax" or something not worth sweating over. 
October 24, 2016	USA TODAY	We've spent a lot of time talking about Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and sex. Meanwhile, over at The Week, Damon Linker asks plaintively, "Why won't anyone admit that America is fighting five wars?" The short answer is that although the next president will inherit an ugly and dangerous world situation, it doesn't serve the interests of any players to talk about it before the election.  Trump has focused on immigration, political correctness and other domestic issues. His foreign policy, to the extent that he has one, seems to boil down to leaving other countries alone unless they cause trouble, and bombing them into oblivion if they do. That doesn't leave him much to talk about. Hillary Clinton doesn't want to talk about our military/diplomatic messes because she had a hand in  them. She likes to talk about her experience as secretary of State but not so much about her accomplishments, because those aren't anything to write home about. In Syria, where we mentioned a "red line," things have gotten much worse. Hundreds of thousands have died, an exodus of refugees has destabilized politics in Europe, and Russian President Vladimir Putin seems to be well on the way to dismantling America's post-Cold War dominance in the region. Iran openly mocks the U.S. as it harasses our vessels and even seizes our boats and sailors. Saudi Arabia is embroiled in a (U.S.-supported) war in Yemen that isn't going well. The Islamic State terrorist group remains a threat in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. In once-peaceful Libya, where the Bush administration had brokered a deal in which dictator Moammar Gadhafi gave up his weapons of mass destruction, things have also gone to hell. Then-Secretary of State Clinton and the Europeans led an effort to remove Gadhafi. But instead of  a peaceful, pro-Western state, we got more problems with terrorist networks and another wave of refugees flooding Europe. In Asia, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has pronounced the United States a "loser" and decided to side with China -- a move Foreign Policy calls "a disaster for the United States." A different Democratic presidential nominee -- former senator James Webb, say, or even Sen. Bernie Sanders -- could separate himself from Obama's policies and their results. But Clinton can't. Obama's policies, and their results, are Clinton's as well. In a healthier society, a free press would be talking about these issues whether the candidates wanted to or not. But in today's society, the press doesn't want to make things tougher for Clinton. The next president will likely confront a much uglier and more dangerous world than existed in 2008. And the 2016 campaign will have done nothing to prepare the nation for the decisions that must be made. Thanks, candidates. Thanks, press. Glenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors. 
December 14, 2016	USA TODAY	The allegation that the Russians intervened in last month's election remains just that: an allegation. Even the FBI and the CIA are conflicted over what happened. The absence of certainty has not stopped  Hillary Clinton's supporters  from promoting the pathetic  charge that the Russians rigged the election.  One can appreciate our foreign policy establishment's anxiety about the incoming administration's apparent tilt toward Russia. The country is run by a strongman, Vladimir Putin, who has said and done much we don't like. But  suggesting he stole our election is a self-serving fallacy. More investigative journalism was undertaken by the hackers, whoever they were, than by the  media establishment, which was consumed by a passion to defeat Donald Trump. The information they provided was factual, giving  voters more information. As far as dealing with the Russians, FDR, Churchill and Truman cooperated with Stalin to defeat Hitler. In this generation, we need that same sort of cooperation with Putin to eradicate the Islamic State. We may even work with him to deal with emerging challenges from Iran and China. Too many still look at Russia through a Cold War lens. One thing I learned while working for President Reagan was the need  to  focus on the most important objective. Reagan's priority was defeating the Soviet Union and, yes, we did ally with some unsavory characters. The priority today? Defeat radical Islamic terrorism. Putin is by no means guiltless in the deterioration of relations between our countries. Both sides failed. We broke faith with a Putin-brokered deal with Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, which resulted in his downfall and an expansion of radical Islamic power. Putin has had ample reason to lose faith in America's resolve. Let's not forget that after the 9/11 attacks, Putin was the first  leader to volunteer support. The Russians were enormously helpful in facilitating the supply of our military operations in Afghanistan. After that, our relations deteriorated. The Obama-Clinton "reset" with Russia failed. Under President Trump, we may hope for a successful reset. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., chairs the House Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats subcommittee. 
January 24, 2017	USA TODAY	Automakers used to complain their economic and technological importance were underappreciated, but after having been singled out by President Trump about  their operations in Mexico and other nations, they already are praying for a return to anonymity. Trump did not mention automakers specifically in his inaugural address Friday, taking a break after taking them to task repeatedly in tweets about the need to bring jobs back to the U.S. But they have already learned how to succeed in the new political environment: Facing the president's willingness to criticize individual companies, smart automakers will package their investment plans in ways aimed at delighting the White House. Statement: Ford canceled a $2.6 billion plant in Mexico to make the Focus  and brought the work back to America. Reality: Ford canceled plans to build a new assembly plant in Mexico. Bad news for Mexico, but not necessarily good news for the United States. The move, however, didn't prevent the moving of production of the Focus compact car from Michigan to Mexico. Ford just won't go to a new plant there. Instead, Focus will be built at a plant that Ford opened in 1986 during the Reagan administration, seven years before the North American Free Trade Agreement was passed. Reality: The Wayne assembly plant in suburban Michigan that built the Focus and other small cars is converting to build the midsize Ranger pickup and Bronco SUV. The plant's workers will be idle during the changeover, but their jobs should be more secure when they start making the trucks, which are likely to be more popular and profitable than small cars. The Ranger goes on sale next year, the Bronco in 2019. Statement: Detractors have charged that the U.S. doesn't export enough vehicles, and we're losers in the global market. Reality: U.S auto exports hit a record 2.7 million in 2016, says John McElroy of TV's Autoline. America ships vehicles to 150 countries around the world. Wards Auto reports our largest trading partners are Canada: 969,000; China, 266,000; Mexico, 225,000; and Germany, 176,000. American-based companies build millions more vehicles around the world, the great majority of which they sell in the markets where they build them. Reality: There probably wouldn't be a Cruze hatchback if GM had to build it in the United States. The Cruze hatch is the poster child for why interconnected global manufacturing footprints make automakers stronger. Chevy sold about 184,300 Cruze sedans in America last year -- all built in Lordstown, Ohio. It brought 4,500 hatchbacks in from Mexico. GM wouldn't have invested millions of dollars for that few vehicles at its plant in Lordstown, Ohio, but it makes sense to build them in Mexico, where that body style is popular and they sell well. Without Mexican production, the 4,500 Americans who bought Cruze hatchbacks might be lost to other car brands. Reality: Germans already buy hundreds of thousands of cars GM and Ford make in Germany, although the situation isn't helped by German Minister of economics and Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel's tart response that Americans should "build better cars." 
December 13, 2016	USA TODAY	China said Monday it has "serious concern" about comments by Donald Trump regarding the  island of Taiwan. The  reaction came a day after the president-elect said he did not feel "bound by a one-China policy."  China warned that any changes to U.S. dealings with Taiwan could damage  relations between Beijing and Washington. The United States sees Taiwan as part of China and maintains a formal relationship with China and an unofficial one with the island. On Fox News, Trump said, "I fully understand the one-China policy, but I don't know why we have to be bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade." Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, said established policy is the "political foundation" of any diplomatic relationship between China and the United States, the Associated Press reported. "We urge the new U.S. leader and government to fully understand the seriousness of the Taiwan issue and to continue to stick to the one-China policy," Geng said. The Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, said in an editorial Monday that Trump was "as ignorant as a child." Last week, Taiwan's leader Tsai Ing-wen said a  phone call between her and Trump on Dec. 2 did not signal a change in policy. 
February 9, 2016	USA TODAY	Carl Ichan, whose reputation as a successful businessman made him a talking point of Donald Trump's presidential bid, is taking a beating in his energy investments. Shares of Oklahoma City-based oil and gas producer Chesapeake Energy Corporation plunged by 50% Monday on rumors that it could seek to file for bankruptcy protection.  Chesapeake has since denied the rumors, and the shares closed down $1.02, or 33%, at $2.04 on Monday. Over the last 12 months, Chespeake's shares are down 90% from $20 a share. Icahn's publicly traded investment company, Icahn Enterprises, owns 11% of Chesapeake's outstanding shares, according to regulatory filings. The 80-year-old billionaire, who recently won a bidding war for iconic auto repair company Pep Boys -- Manny, Moe & Jack, didn't immediately return a request for comment. Energy company stocks are suffering broadly on fears that an economic slowdown in China could spread and reduce demand for oil, natural gas and other fuel sources. Ichan also owns sizable investments in Cheniere Energy and CVR Energy, according to regulatory filings. Both companies are suffering on concerns of sagging demand, which has pushed oil prices to below $30 a barrel this year, the lowest levels since 2003. Shares of Cheniere Energy are down 68% over the past 12 months to $23.64 a share. Shares of CVR Energy, meanwhile, are down 31% this year to $28.48. "Chesapeake currently has no plans to pursue bankruptcy and is aggressively seeking to maximize value for all shareholders," the company said in a statement Monday. The rumors started on a report that Chesapeake had started working with restructuring law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Monday, Chesapeake said Kirkland has served as one of Chesapeake's counsel since 2010 "and continues to advise the company as it seeks to further strengthen its balance sheet following its recent debt exchange." 
June 6, 2016	USA TODAY	International trade has taken a beating in this year's presidential campaign. Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders regularly bash it in their stump speeches, and even Hillary Clinton turned against an Asian trade agreement that she championed while secretary of State.  Given the evidence that trade stimulates innovation, lowers prices and offers consumers more choice, this has been a big disappointment. It has infected both parties and comes off as a highly cynical ploy to win over voters by playing with their emotions. However, supporters of responsible trade need to understand why the electorate has turned so sour and find ways to help those left behind by globalization. The data show the problem: Manufacturing employment has fallen by nearly 5 million, or about 28%, in the past two decades. Meanwhile, the recovery from the Great Recession remains modest, evidenced by the creation of just 38,000 jobs in May. But halting pending trade deals, or even repealing existing ones, is not the answer. The U.S. does not have any commerce agreements with China or Japan. And yet those nations consistently maintain the largest trade surpluses with America. In fact, only three of our 15 largest trade partners -- Canada, Mexico and South Korea -- have trade agreements with the United States. What's more, there is strong evidence that technology is the main reason for the decline in manufacturing employment. Manufacturing output has continued to rise thanks to more automated workplaces and a focus on higher-tech products. The only real solution to the decline is to train young people in areas with a more promising outlook, and to retrain workers who've lost jobs or fear they might. The good news is that, after years of trial and error, government leaders are beginning to get a sense of what works and what doesn't. To that end, President Obama signed a bipartisan law two years ago to eliminate notoriously overlapping or unproductive training programs and give states more freedom to spend jobs money as they see fit. Virtually everyone agrees that what works are apprenticeships and similar programs that bring employers into the process early and have workers do much of their learning on the job. Some successful programs, like one in Wisconsin known as WTRP/Big Step, focus on glaziers, electricians, cement masons and other traditional blue-collar trades. Others are branching into health care and other areas not generally thought of as landing spots for people without a college education. Two large European insurance companies -- Aon and the Zurich Insurance Group -- have apprenticeships for people as claims adjusters and other positions in their industry. We ought to double down on approaches like these, instead of erecting trade barriers that would do terrible harm to the economy or making futile efforts to limit technological advance. Candidates for high office should be candid about this. And they should get behind programs that might actually do some good. 
September 9, 2016	USA TODAY	The Hispanic population living in the USA is growing at the slowest rate since official record-keeping began nearly 50 years ago, according to a report released Thursday. Hispanics grew by an average of more than 5% annually throughout the 1970s, '80s and '90s, driving much of the population growth in the country. According to a new report from the Pew Research Center, that number started falling in 2007 with the Great Recession and continued to slide to a record-low 2.1% growth rate in 2014. Mark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic research at Pew and a co-author of the report, said the drop is because of lower levels of legal and illegal immigration to the USA from Mexico and lower birthrates among Hispanics.  The report comes as immigration and the role of Hispanics in the USA continue to play a central role in the presidential election. Republican Donald Trump has focused his campaign on stopping illegal immigration and slowing legal immigration, while Democrat Hillary Clinton has vowed to protect some undocumented immigrants from deportation, trying to maximize her appeal with Hispanic voters. Lopez said Hispanics continued driving much of the country's growth in recent years, accounting for 54% of the nation's population growth since 2000. As fewer Hispanic immigrants enter the country and more Hispanics settle into their communities, the group is not spreading around the country as widely as it once did. The share of U.S. counties with at least 1,000 Hispanics grew from 27% in 1990 to 38% in 2000 and 46% in 2007, according to the report. Since then, the share of U.S. counties with at least 1,000 Hispanics has grown only 4%. Lopez said the counties that remain with small numbers of Hispanics are mostly remote places that don't have job markets to lure large numbers of people, Hispanic or not. "You're talking about counties in rural Alaska or rural Montana," he said. "Maybe the Latinos have dispersed across all the counties that have economic opportunities for them." The report highlighted the rise in immigration from other countries, including China and India. The growth rate of the Asian population in the USA is higher than the Hispanic population. Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, said that's partly because the large number of Hispanics in the USA makes it difficult to maintain such a high growth rate. There are 55 million Hispanics in the USA, which represents 17.4% of the population. Capps said it's difficult to imagine that Hispanics could return to the days of 5% annual growth. The only areas that saw drops in their Hispanic population from 2007 to 2014 were focused in a rural corner of western Texas, southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. Lopez said those are agricultural areas with older populations, meaning people are dying faster than immigrants are moving in. About 72% of Hispanics in counties with the fastest-growing Hispanic populations speak English proficiently, compared with the national average of 68%. The states with the largest number of Hispanics remained California (15 million), Texas (10.4million), Florida (4.8 million), New York (3.7 million) and Illinois (2.2 million). States where Hispanics make up the largest percentage of the population are New Mexico (48%), California (39%), Texas (39%), Arizona (31%) and Nevada (28%). Pew conducted its review using data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The bureau began counting Hispanics in 1970.

September 28, 2016	USA TODAY	Both U.S. presidential candidates have vowed to take on the world when it comes to cyber warfare. But full-scale cyber retaliation might be hard to spot and even harder to count as a win.  "Unlike a traditional war, there is no end where there are clear winners and losers, no physical flag to capture," said Peter Tran, senior director at RSA Security in the company's worldwide advanced cyber defense practice. If the U.S. were to ramp up its counterattacks on countries it thinks are sponsoring hackers that breach American accounts, don't expect a sci-fi digital armageddon. The target's electric grid might still work, and so may the ATMs. Think of it more as a creeping worry that simple things we rely on can't be trusted -- the machines that count our votes, the total on our bank balance, our personal digital files. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said the U.S. had the capability to stop the waves of attacks, which vaulted into the public consciousness again last week with Yahoo's disclosure that information from at least 500 million customer accounts was stolen in 2014. Yahoo said it believed the hacks came from a state-sponsored actor. "We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity. And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information," Clinton said. In his reply, Republican nominee Donald Trump seemed to indicate the problems posed by cyber attacks were almost insurmountable. "So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is -- it is a huge problem. I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable," he said. One advantage of cyber warfare is that it's reversible, experts say. In a traditional war the only way to destroy an enemy's electric grid or transportation system is to physically destroy them. With cyber you can take them down, but once the conflict is over they can be brought brought back online. "It's potentially more humane," said Matt Devost, managing director of Accenture Security and a special government adviser to the  Department of Defense. 
November 16, 2016	USA TODAY	In what may be a first among Detroit's Big 3 automakers, EcoSport is going to be made in India and imported into the U.S. General Motors recently started importing the Buick Envision SUV from China, but Ford is rare in choosing to import EcoSport -- what will become its smallest crossover -- from Chennai, India, when it goes on sale in 2018. Ford has come under attack in recent months from President-elect Donald Trump for moving production of small cars from the U.S. to Mexico. All other major automakers also have expanded and built new plants in Mexico. EcoSport also is made in Brazil. "We build EcoSport in six locations around the globe. We sell it in 100 markets, and so, just like we make Explorers and export from here into other global markets, we are going to export EcoSport from Asia Pacific, and we are going to sell it here in the U.S," said Michael O'Brien, Ford marketing manager for SUVs.
January 6, 2017	USA TODAY	One of the nation's best-known toolmakers, Stanley Black & Decker, said Thursday that it will move more manufacturing back to the U.S. from overseas, including construction of a new $35million factory after acquiring the Craftsman brand from ailing retailer Sears Holdings.  Expanding American manufacturing makes "business sense" amid "pervasive" uncertainty regarding the future of U.S. trade with China and Mexico, Stanley Black & Decker CEO James Loree told investors Thursday in a conference call. Although he did not mention Donald Trump by name in his remarks to investors, Loree hinted that the move has the side benefit of inoculating his company from the possible effects of the president-elect's threatened "border tax," a tariff on imports. The sale of Craftsman marks another big move by Sears Holdings to stem losses. It also announced the closing of another 150 stores, including 108 Kmart locations. Stanley Black & Decker is buying Craftsman for about $900 million, including future royalty payments. The move came several months after Sears put the Craftsman, Kenmore and DieHard brands up for sale as it seeks an elusive turnaround. Including the closing of 108 Kmart and 42 Sears stores, the company said the moves are "a difficult but necessary step as we take actions to strengthen the company's operations and fund its transformation." Stanley Black & Decker has about 3,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs today, up 800 from three years ago, according to the toolmaker. It was not immediately clear how many jobs the company plans to add. Loree said the location of the new manufacturing plant to produce Craftsman products has not yet been determined. The company currently operates 29 total U.S. plants. About a half-century ago, the Craftsman brand was primarily made in America. Today it's largely made overseas, Loree said. "We believe this is an excellent opportunity to re-Americanize and revitalize this legendary brand," he told investors. In addition to the threat of trade policies that could damage imports, manufacturing products in the U.S. to sell to American consumers reduces logistics and distribution costs and lowers the company's environmental footprint, Loree said. 
August 1, 2016	USA TODAY	The Democratic presidential ticket took a victory lap through the Midwest after what was, by and large, a successful convention. But the three-day bus tour also illustrated Hillary Clinton's challenges in closing the deal with voters who have a deep-seated mistrust of Washington.  Clinton's blue campaign bus, emblazoned with her "Stronger Together" slogan, traveled a couple hundred miles, including along the Appalachian Mountain ridge in western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio, rolling past Dollar Stores, bowling alleys, red-painted barns and dilapidated wooden homes with porches. These are the rural communities where there's a current of anger over the 20-year decline of the nation's middle class. The resentment stems from trade agreements championed by both parties as well as political elites they feel are corrupt and have abandoned the country's heartland while enriching themselves. From Harrisburg, Pa., to Youngstown, Clinton sought to make a personal connection with voters while touting her economic plan, which calls for the biggest investment in jobs since World War II. She shared the story of her grandfather, who did "dangerous" work in a Scranton, Pa., lace mill, and pledged to "fight" for those who feel "left behind." "There are a lot of people in our country who are frustrated, they feel like maybe the economy has passed them by, their government doesn't help them, that nobody is listening and nobody cares about them," she said in Pittsburgh. "I get that." Clinton also said GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has "zero" economic plans while pointing to his business record of manufacturing his branded products in such places as China and Bangladesh. "The only thing he makes in America are bankruptcies, both his own and for the people who do business with him," Clinton said in Hatfield, Pa. Yet her challenge here is demonstrated by the fact that even some local Democrats say their party shares in the blame for rural America's economic and social plight. Johnstown, where Clinton visited a steel-wire manufacturer, exemplifies the regions drifting away from the Democratic Party. "When you come to towns like Johnstown, where they have bled manufacturing jobs the past 30 years, where they have the highest poverty rate in the state" and a heroin epidemic, "they are really suffering," said Erin McClelland, a Democrat running to represent Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district. "They feel the Democratic Party has abandoned them, talks down to them, calls them stupid," she said. 
August 22, 2016	USA TODAY	America doesn't win anymore, according to the Republican candidate for president. "The country is in serious trouble. ... We can't do anything right," Donald Trump said at last year's first GOP debate, a theme he has continued to hammer throughout his campaign.  Well, if that's the case, Team USA didn't get the memo. As the Summer Olympics wrapped up on Sunday in Rio de Janeiro, the United States came away with 121 medals, far more than any other nation. China and Mexico, which are supposedly leaving the U.S. in the dust, ended up with 70 and 5 medals, respectively. As for the nation-in-decline narrative, the U.S. medal count was its highest since the 174 at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles (which the Soviet bloc boycotted) and up from 93 in 2000, 101 in 2004, 110 in 2008 and 103 in 2012. What does this have to do with trade, immigration, national security or the other areas where Trump says the U.S. is losing ground? More than you might think. While his campaign has trafficked in xenophobia and white nationalism, Team USA has showcased America in all its glory as a multicultural and economic powerhouse. In basketball, swimming and other sports, in fact, America is so dominant that other nations are the ones tired of all that winning. 
February 3, 2016	USA TODAY	If the New Hampshire polls are right, Hillary Clinton could be heading into Armageddon -- at least for one night. The state that saved her presidential nomination bid in 2008 looks almost certain to humiliate her Tuesday.  But Clinton is not skipping New Hampshire, where Bernie Sanders is leading her by an average of 18 points. Nor did she skip Iowa, where she finished a devastating third in 2008. Her "reward" this week was holding Sanders to a draw in a state that has never embraced her. The victory she claimed was barely discernible (49.9% to Sanders' 49.6%) but it sure beats coming in third behind Barack Obama and John Edwards. If she had lost to Sanders this time, how crushing would that have been? She came to Iowa to banish ghosts, not to suffer another embarrassing loss at the hands of another unlikely opponent. Clinton accomplished her mission. And if you're one of the many Democrats nervous about her email mess and looking for something to like about her, consider that Iowa could have gone either way. The risk was real, but that did not deter her. Compare her grit with the GOP wimps. Some Republicans all but skipped Iowa, and I don't blame them. If you're a practical-minded governor with experience and policy ideas, why even attempt to compete for a huge evangelical contingent (62% of the GOP electorate Monday night) or for the break-the-china brigade (the 48% who said the best preparation for being president was being from outside politics)? Donald Trump drew 46% of that group. But Clinton did try hard, even though her mildly hawkish security views, lengthy résumé and workmanlike view of politics have never evoked the frissons of a Barack or a Bernie among Democrats in the Field of Dreams state. Political viability isn't a huge winner there, either. Only 20% of Democratic caucus voters named "can win in November" as the quality that mattered most. Clinton cleaned up with them and with those who liked an experienced hand. But Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist, completely dominated among the 50% who picked either "cares about people like me" or "honest and trustworthy." He also swept voters under 45, and those making less than $50,000. These are dynamics that could well follow Clinton into New Hampshire. But there was never any doubt she'd compete there. Clinton is well positioned to win the Nevada Democratic caucuses on Feb. 20 and the South Carolina Democratic primary on Feb. 27. Decisive victories in those two states would restore her front-runner status and, less favorably for her, the sense of inevitability that drains excitement from the race. But after battling Sanders to a tie in Iowa and preparing now for what she must know could be a very disappointing evening in New Hampshire, that's a trade she is no doubt happy to make.
September 14, 2016	USA TODAY	Why aren't Donald Trump's businesses held to the same standard as the Clinton family's charity? Republicans Karl Rove and Newt Gingrich have piously called for the Clinton Foundation to be shuttered. USA TODAY says it should be wound down and its important work transferred elsewhere. The New York Times proposes that a giant wall be built between anyone named Clinton and the foundation if Hillary Clinton wins the White House -- a wall that presumably will be paid for by the millions of people the charity helps. Meanwhile, there has been little to no discussion about how Trump could be the most indebted major party candidate for president in U.S. history, while also being the least transparent nominee since Watergate.  Voters still have no idea how much self-proclaimed billionaire Trump wants to cut his own taxes. Without his tax returns, which he has promised and failed to release two dozen times since 2011, voters have no idea if the Republican nominee for president even pays any taxes. Trump's companies represent a vast array of properties, investments and licenses around the world. And these businesses also appear to hold at least $650 million in debt to a variety of lenders, including Goldman Sachs, the Bank of China and Deutsche Bank, which is probably not German for "America First." Despite the reportedly huge debt and Trump's six corporate bankruptcies, we have to assume the exclusive goal of these ventures is profit -- at least for him. He received millions in compensation as his casinos went broke. The Trump Organization's golf courses, resorts and various other holdings don't get in involved with anything as sordid as saving the lives of AIDS patients. Even so, anyone who cares about the office of the presidency should be calling for Trump and his family to completely divest from his business interests should he be elected president. The candidate's three oldest children, Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr., are all executive vice presidents of the Trump Organization. He has suggested that they will take over day-to-day operations of his company, shunning the "blind trust" that nearly all modern presidents have relied on to avoid the appearance of any conflict of interest. Instead of avoiding suspicions, Trump is -- as usual -- encouraging them. But even if it's strangers instead of his kids running his business, it's impossible to separate Trump's interests from the Trump Organization. "To put your identity into a blind trust is a little bit difficult," government professor Andrew Rudalevige told NPR. Trump's identity is literally his business. Much of the value of the conglomerate is  tied not only to Trump's name but also to Trump's mood. In a 2009 deposition, he said his net worth "goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings." With his wealth and his "feelings" on the line, U.S. policies will become inextricable from the president's business strategy. Would a country win favor from the most powerful nation in the world by propping up Trump businesses? Would the president avoid conflict with a nation that offers him sweet tax credits? How many people believe that a fortunate son whose entire life has been about leaving his even more fortunate kids a conglomerate larger than his parents left him -- and now eliminating any taxes they might pay on their inheritance -- would put the nation's interests over his own? Probably about as many as those who believe that Mexico will pay for Trump's imaginary border wall -- 13% in a recent poll. We saw candidate Trump prioritize profit over sense when he took a few days off in the middle of his presidential campaign to open a golf course in the swing state of Scotland. And we have decent evidence that Trump's overwhelming interest in his own interests wouldn't change even if he happened to win in November. In this Jackson Pollock landscape of a presidential election, one of the most revealing splatters mostly went unnoticed. This summer, we learned that the last time Trump considered running for president, in 2011, he reportedly pitched NBC the idea of filming Celebrity Apprentice from the White House, as president of United States. Presumably, each episode would have ended with one of the members of Trump's celebrity Cabinet being fired -- or deported. This is a not too surprising peek into the mind-set of a reality star who sees everything, including the job of the most powerful person in the world, as fodder for his TV career. If the world can live without the Clinton Foundation, we'll find a way to make do without Trump home furnishings.
March 3, 2016	USA TODAY	Detroit's historic bankruptcy should serve as a wake-up call to U.S. politicians who are ignoring a national debt crisis that could  threaten the livelihoods of millions of American retirees. As the Republican presidential candidates hit the Motor City on Thursday for a Fox News debate -- and as the two remaining Democratic candidates  campaign there before Tuesday's Michigan primary -- it's critical to understand why Detroit's financial collapse should be a red flag for America. Detroit's remarkable escape from $7 billion in debt finally put the well-being of its 688,000 residents before its 170,000 creditors, as documented in my upcoming book. But the city's debt crisis offers a crucial lesson for presidential candidates on the importance of shoring up the nation's balance sheet to ensure that, unlike in Detroit, benefits are preserved for American retirees.  For starters, government debt at the local, state and national levels is much higher than you've been told. In Detroit, the city owed only about $1.1 billion in traditional unsecured bonds. But it owed about 10 times more to its retirees through unfunded pension debt, retiree health care obligations and pension bonds. By comparison, the national debt -- at least the figure you usually hear -- is about $19.1 trillion. But that number does not include the true cost of benefits. It turns out the U.S. government has promised an astounding $41.9 trillion in Social Security, Medicare and other retiree benefits over the next 75 years that it cannot pay for under current revenue projections, according to the Treasury Department's Sept. 30, 2014, Statements of Social Insurance. Taken together, that means the true national debt is $61 trillion. That's more than three times U.S. gross domestic product, and it reflects a debt-to-income ratio of about 19-to-1 based on current government revenue. As a consequence of the city's  collapse, 32,000 retirees paid the price for unrealistic promises -- pension cuts of up to 20% and a  90% cut in health care benefits. To ensure the next president is prepared to address this issue, here are three key questions that Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders must be prepared to answer: How will you fix Social Security: tax increases, benefit cuts, privatization or some mix of the above? Don't say doing nothing is an option. If you want to connect with Millennials, it's time to deliver answers. A 2014 Pew Research study found that 51% of Millennials believe they will receive no Social Security benefits when they retire. Is it possible to balance the  budget without dramatic changes to Medicare or tax increases? Expenditures on Social Security, Medicare and other health and employment programs represented 60% of the  government's 2015 spending, according to the National Priorities Project.  Some form of tax increases, benefit cuts or a total overhaul of the  health care system is required. Choose a path, but don't ignore reality. Does a global debt binge pose a threat to our economic security? If the answer is no, how do we explain the near collapse of Greece, the debt crisis in Puerto Rico, bulging liabilities in China -- and the corresponding economic troubles there? A 2015 McKinsey study found that from the end of 2007 through the end of 2014, global debt grew by $57 trillion, as the rate of new governmental debt added annually increased by 60% to 9.3% of GDP. The good news in Detroit is that the city is moving in the opposite direction. After a bipartisan bankruptcy settlement dubbed the "grand bargain" -- which won the approval of Republicans and Democrats in the state legislature, as well as Wall Street lenders and retirees -- the city's budget is balanced. More important, the mayor and the City Council are working together to invest in public safety, turn the street lights back on and tear down abandoned homes, using cash flow that was previously diverted to creditors. Detroit has a second chance at life, but it came in part at the expense of its vulnerable pensioners. Thankfully, it's not too late to protect American retirees. But it's long past time for a more serious national conversation about the policies necessary to shore up the social safety net. Nathan Bomey is a business reporter for USA TODAY and author of the forthcoming Detroit Resurrected: To Bankruptcy and Back. 
July 12, 2016	USA TODAY	Controversial Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who campaigned on a vow to kill 100,000 criminals, is making good on his promise less than two weeks into his term. In that short span, he has left a bloody trail of drug world executions that is drawing alarm from human rights groups and opposition politicians. Duterte was sworn in June 30, and within the first week of his presidency, 72 people accused of being drug dealers were killed by police and vigilante groups, according to a "Kill List" compiled by the newspaper Philippine Inquirer. Dating back to Duterte's election victory May 10, the figure jumps to 119.  Last weekend, police reported nine more killings, including an unidentified man found in Manila with his head wrapped in tape and a cardboard sign on his torso that read, "I Am a Pusher." Human rights lawyer Jose Manuel Diokno, national chairman of the Free Legal Assistance Group, called the spate of killings "a nuclear explosion of violence." "Do we really want to give the man with the gun the power to judge who are criminals and to kill them? To decide who is bad and who is good, who deserves to live and who deserves to die?" he wrote in a blog for the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism. "Human Rights Watch is concerned that President Duterte's electoral platform, which included repeated promises to kill those deemed to be criminals and drug dealers, may be interpreted by some as a legitimization of the unlawful concept of extrajudicial killings as an acceptable approach to crime control," said Phelim Kine, the group's Asia deputy director. "Not only does each case need to be investigated, but it's crucial there be an inquiry into the surge in killings since June 30 and action taken to put an end to it." Duterte, whose incendiary rhetoric has earned him comparisons to Donald Trump, campaigned on a platform of law and order and ending corruption. The seven-term mayor of Davao, a city on the restive southern island of Mindanao, was wildly popular for solving the city's drug and crime problems. But his tactics, which earned him nicknames such as "The Punisher" and "Duterte Harry," included more than 1,000 extrajudicial killings using death squads, according to rights groups. After winning the presidency in a landslide victory in May, Duterte doubled down on his tough talk. Last month, he encouraged vigilante justice against criminals and drug dealers in a televised address. "Please feel free to call us, the police, or do it yourself if you have the gun, you have my support," he said. "You can kill him. Shoot him, and I'll give you a medal." Days after taking office, Duterte publicly named five high-ranking police officials allegedly tied to the drug trade and ordered them removed from their posts. He named three major drug traffickers, all Chinese nationals, in a televised speech and warned that they would be executed if they remained involved in the drug trade. Two are in prison but could be operating their drug empires from behind bars. An opposition political leader, Sen. Leila de Lima, called last week for a legislative investigation into the spate of killings. Duterte also has his supporters in government for his brutal approach to fighting drugs and crime in a country that has been deeply plagued by both. A large segment of the population appears willing to give Duterte's violent tactics a chance, according to political analyst Richard Javad Heydarian, author of Asia's New Battlefield: The USA, China and the Struggle for the Western Pacific. "Though liberal circles and human rights groups have expressed strong criticism in recent days, it seems much of the public is adopting a passive or wait-and-see approach, since there is a deep sense that previous administrations dedicated limited political capital to ensuring law and order," Heydarian said. High-ranking officials in the Duterte administration remain unbowed by the criticism of how they wage the drug war. Solicitor General Jose Calida, the top legal official in the country, assured police Monday that he would protect them against any charges of extrajudicial killings. 
July 14, 2016	USA TODAY	A: Political rhetoric is hitting a fever pitch. Investors are wondering not only who will win in November but  which stocks will win or lose.  Examining the key aspects of both the Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump campaigns, investors can try to see which  topics will affect individual stocks and sectors. S&P Global Market Intelligence sees all 10 sectors experiencing shocks. Minimum-wage legislation and illegal immigration will be factors for consumer discretionary and consumer staples stocks, respectively, S&P Global says. The debate over federal support for renewable energy will affect the energy sector, and the future of Dodd-Frank regulation will hit financials. Debate over the Affordable Care Act will be a driver for health care stocks while defense spending is an issue for industrials. Technology companies continue to be subject to debate over foreign earnings and taxes while U.S.-Chinese trade negotiations are pivotal to materials stocks. Net neutrality continues to be a touch point for telecom stocks and coal-based energy generation has been an influence on utilities. Expect these issues and the affected sectors to start to react even more once the conventions kick off next week. 
July 15, 2016	USA TODAY	The No. 1-ranked 1990s megabull isn't the only one that knows what it takes to live a long, profitable life. Today's never-say-die bull  -- now the second longest at seven years and counting -- has longevity genes, too. And, if things go its way, the current bull market -- which has powered the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index to four consecutive days of record highs more than a year after its last peak -- might  challenge the record-setting '90s rally that lasted 3,452 days before being snuffed out in early 2000 by the bursting of the Internet stock bubble. To eclipse the 1990s bull market the current rally needs to go another 768 days -- or two years and 38 days -- without suffering a decline of more than 19.99% -- just shy of a bear market.  Never say never, Wall Street pros say. This bull, despite expensive stocks, slowing global growth, a wobbly Chinese economy, less profitable U.S. companies and fallout from Britain's vote to exit the European Union, continues to defy skeptics. "I can't say it will, but I will say  it could," Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, says of the current bull's chance to outlast the nearly 10-year run from Oct. 11, 1990, to March 24, 2000. Agreed. But a lot went right for the '90s bull. Recall that then-Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned of investors being "irrationally exuberant" three-plus years before the stock market's ultimate top. The current bull, distrusted since it began in March 2009 after the worst stock plunge since the Great Depression, is 2,684 days young, S&P Dow Jones Indices says. Not bad given that critics say its 220% gain has been artificially inflated by central bank stimulus and cheap-money policies. But this bull, despite the naysayers, could continue to exceed expectations. "It has a chance if it doesn't become over-loved," says Ann Miletti, lead portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management. She gives the current bull a "better than 60% chance" of one day becoming the longest  ever. "It has been a slow growth market for a long time and a bumpy ride along the way. But that has also meant that expectations have remained tempered and valuations have been kept in check, which is a good setup for longevity." The subpar pace of U.S. growth since the end of the Great Recession seven years ago could also work in the bull's favor, keeping the economy from overheating. The run could go another eight to 13 years, says Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets. He's voicing short-term caution because the S&P 500 is trading about 3% above his year-end target of 2,100 but is sticking to his call for a "secular" bull market that could last a total 15 to 20 years. Belski says improving U.S. business conditions will trump years of market "fear" driven by "emotions not analysis." Cash, he says, is coming back to U.S. assets, including stocks, after years of money chasing commodities and emerging market investments. The great migration out of bonds and back into stocks has not occurred yet, but will, he predicts. Belski is advising clients to position their portfolios for "what is coming next: a recovery in U.S. growth." High-quality, brand-name U.S. companies should do well, he says. Wall Street skeptics and bears don't buy it. It's unlikely everything will go right for the  market in the next two years and that it will be able to avoid a drop of 20%, counters Axel Merk, chief investment officer at Merk Investments. "In a fairy tale world, we will never have a bear market again," Merk says. "To me, this feels eerily like 2000." But this time Merk's concern centers around the U.S. government bond market, which is as pricey as it ever has been. Another concern: Many overseas sovereign bonds sport negative yields. "We keep rationalizing why low to negative yields are appropriate, why this time is different," Merk says. "In 2000, it took over three years after Greenspan's warning of irrational exuberance until the markets caved." Also working against the bulls: U.S. stocks aren't cheap. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times estimated earnings for the forward four quarters, above the long-term average of around 15. Global economic growth is slowing. That means the economy and corporate earnings must rebound to justify the  valuations, Joy says. What else has to go right? The Federal Reserve, which has held off on interest rate hikes this year, must keep its word and avoid snuffing out the economic rebound or stock rally by hiking rates too far, too fast. The fallout from Britain's vote to exit the European Union must be less onerous than feared. China's economy can't collapse. The world's central bankers, which are nearly out of ammunition to fight the next downturn, can't lose credibility with investors. And the U.S. presidential candidates also can't keep saying things that spook markets. Despite the risks, there's a chance the bull can continue to skirt a drop of 20% or more. Working in the  market's favor, Wren says, is the fact few investors are in love with this rally. "Normally these bull cycles end with a lot of enthusiasm and chasing by retail investors, but we are nowhere near that now," Wren says. For the current bull to outlive the 1990s bull, four things have to happen, says John Augustine, chief investment officer at The Huntington National Bank: 1.The U.S. economy must avoid a recession. (The U.S. economy went 10 years without a recession from March 1991 to March 2001, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a period of economic prosperity that coincided with nearly all of the '90s bull market.) 3.The U.S. profits recession -- which began in the third quarter of 2015 -- has to end as scheduled in this year's third quarter. (A big difference between the market peak last May and now, Augustine points out, is the S&P 500's profit recession was just beginning but now Wall Street sees profits soon turning positive.) 4.The U.S. political outcome in November must reflect the "optimism of America" -- not the negativism of the primary season. 
July 21, 2016	USA TODAY	The 50-year-old political operative, as much as any single person, is responsible for the nearly unrestricted flood of money pouring into the 2016 presidential campaign. He runs the conservative advocacy group Citizens United, and his attempt to distribute his 2007 anti-Hillary Clinton movie  gave rise to the Supreme Court's 2010 blockbuster Citizens United decision, which upended decades of campaign-finance rules and allowed corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts to influence federal, state and local elections. Nine years after Hillary: The Movie, the barrel-chested activist now is turning one of the biggest weapons of the post-Citizens United era on Clinton. He's the newly installed leader of the Defeat Crooked Hillary PAC, a super PAC funded largely by hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer that plans to merge cutting-edge technology and old-fashioned opposition research in a push to sink the Democrats' presumptive presidential nominee.  At the same time, Bossie, a longtime outside agitator against the Clintons, is moving closer to the inner circle of a Republican Party now dominated by the biggest outsider of them all: Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Bossie is a first-time convention delegate at this week's Republican National Convention, but he's chairing Maryland's 76-member contingent of delegates and alternates to the Cleveland gathering. The state's Republicans recently elected him as GOP national committeeman, tossing out a veteran who held the seat for more than a decade. On Thursday, convention-goers can screen the latest movie he's produced, Torchbearer, in which Duck Dynasty reality TV star Phil Robertson ties the fall of the Roman Empire, the rise of Nazism and terrorist attacks by the Islamic State to godlessness. Next week, Bossie will be at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia as one of the Republican National Committee's anti-Clinton surrogates. "I'm now a member of the RNC," Bossie boasted during an interview this week, tugging at the official party credential that dangled from his neck. His ascension, he said, is a sign that the "establishment is really moving much more towards the conservative movement, which is an exciting thing for the grass roots." Bossie emerged on the political landscape in the 1990s as the top investigator for the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. He helped lead GOP probes of the Clinton administration, including the Whitewater controversy and allegations that China tried to illegally funnel political donations to the Democratic Party. (Bossie resigned in 1998 amid sharp criticism of his role in releasing edited tapes of prison conversations with Webster Hubbell, a Clinton confidant and former Justice Department official who was jailed for overbilling clients while in private practice.) His 2007, 90-minute documentary about Clinton was scathingly critical of the former first lady. Bossie and his allies cast it as an issue-oriented film. The Federal Election Commission and a lower court said it amounted to a political commercial which could not be distributed during the primary season because it was funded by corporate money. In the end, the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling swept aside those limits and said restrictions on independent corporate spending in elections amounted to "censorship." "There are very few people who have played such a singular role as a conservative activist in these campaign-finance issues," Sheila Krumholz, who runs the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, said of Bossie. "It's back to the future for him with Hillary Clinton," she added. "He can keep opening and reopening the same old wounds because he's been an activist as an investigator and instigator for so long." The father of four said young voters don't know enough about Clinton and the controversies that dogged her husband's administration. Part of his job, he said, is to dredge up that history, tie it to the latest controversies about Clinton Foundation funding and Clinton's private email server and use the newest technology and money from deep-pocketed donors to spread the message to voters. Mercer, the co-founder of Renaissance Technologies, recently poured $2 million into the anti-Clinton super PAC as seed money, Bossie said. 
July 27, 2016	USA TODAY	As the nation nears full employment --  a sort of finish line for the jobs recovery -- many of the factory towns hit hardest in the Great Recession are already there. Seven of the 10 metro areas with the highest concentrations of manufacturing jobs had unemployment rates below the 4.7% U.S. rate in May, the latest local data available, according to the Labor Department, Wells Fargo and Moody's Analytics. Buffeted by automation and foreign imports, employment in communities such as Hickory, N.C., and Dalton, Ga., are likely to remain well below pre-recession levels. But at least the towns are growing jobs again, including in factories buoyed by the housing and auto recoveries, and trying to diversify their industrial bases. Manufacturers are competing  against cheaper imports by automating some functions and providing better quality and service.  In some cases,  low unemployment rates are at least partly byproducts of smaller labor forces after many laid-off workers retired or moved to cities with better  opportunities, reducing the number of jobless residents. Still, they signify a measure of stability and  return to gradual job growth. "Small factory towns seem to be making their peace with globalization and technology," Wells Fargo economist Mark Vitner says. That's no small achievement for communities that rely so heavily on one or two sectors, says Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. And it comes against the backdrop of a  vitriolic presidential campaign in which Republican Donald Trump says trade deals have ravaged many factory towns. The Hickory area, a  furniture-making hub and large producer of textiles and fiber-optic cables, had a 4.9% jobless rate in May, down from nearly 15% in 2009. It lost 20,000 jobs in the 2001 recession amid a flood of imports and the fiber glut, and 18,000 more in the Great Recession. About  5,000 jobs have come back. Williams-Sonoma, which makes sofas and chairs at a 600-worker plant there, delivers custom-made pieces to its Pottery Barn and other  stores about a month after the order is placed, compared with about three months for Chinese imports, giving it a leg up, says Darryl Webster,  vice president of upholstery. Meanwhile, the housing recovery has bolstered sales. But with the Hickory area's labor force -- the number of people working and looking for jobs -- 5% smaller than in early 2010, finding skilled workers is a struggle. Webster says he has been trying to fill 50 job openings for several months, forcing him to offer new hires $1,500 signing bonuses.  Many young adults leave for college in bigger cities, such as Raleigh, and don't come back, says Daniel Hearn, CEO of the Catawba County Chamber of Commerce. Another town benefiting  from the housing recovery is Dalton, which calls itself the world's carpet capital. It was devastated in the housing crash. Unemployment, which topped 10% as recently as 2013, now is  5.7%, in part because of a shrunken labor force. Still, payrolls, more than a third of which are factory jobs, are up 9% the past three years. To survive,  companies have automated and employ fewer workers, says Carl Campbell, head of economic development for the Dalton-Whitfield County Joint Development Authority. Officials, he says, are also recruiting other industries, such as autos. Moody's economist Alex Lowy calls Dalton the country's "least industrially diverse metro area," making it tough to attract skilled workers. But Campbell says local employers can draw from nearby big cities, such as Chattanooga, Tenn., about 30 miles away. Still, factory towns riding the housing and auto recoveries face risks. The jobless rate in auto haven Kokomo, Ind., is 4.9%, down from 17% in 2009. But the vehicle market has peaked.
November 7, 2016	USA TODAY	For 17 months, I've traveled this country and met countless Americans from every walk of life. Your hopes have become my hopes and your dreams have become my dreams. I've been inspired on this journey by the millions of you who came to cheer a simple idea: that we can make America great again. Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing job-killing Obamacare -- Americans are experiencing soaring double-digit premium hikes, insurers are leaving, doctors are quitting, jobs are fleeing, and deductibles are through the roof.  It also means immediately fixing our terrible trade deals, which have killed American jobs and crushed American incomes. This means renegotiating Bill and Hillary Clinton's disastrous NAFTA and China deals that have deindustrialized the United States -- importing unemployment and exporting our wealth. It means we don't have to keep kids trapped in failing schools -- that we can give every parent the right to send their kids to the school of their choice, including millions of low-income African-American and Hispanic children who have been failed for generations by Democratic politicians like Hillary Clinton. Real change also means draining the swamp of corruption in Washington. We must fix a rigged system in which political insiders can break the law without consequence and where government officials put special interests above the national interest. If we want to make America great again, we must clean up this corruption. Hillary Clinton has been the subject of an FBI criminal investigation into  many crimes against this nation. Were she ever to be elected, it would trigger an unprecedented constitutional crisis -- Hillary is likely to be under investigation for a long time, grinding our government to a halt. America has too many problems, too many things to fix, to mire our government in years of sordid corruption and criminal investigation. It is time to cut our ties with the failed politicians of the past, and embrace a bright, new future for all of our people. That's what I'm offering in my Contract with the American Voter, a 100-day action plan to clean up corruption and bring change to Washington. It's there for you to read at www.TheTrumpContract.com. In my Contract with the American Voter, I offer a historic pro-growth plan to create 25 million good paying jobs. We will cut taxes on middle-class Americans by 35%. We will eliminate every needless job-killing regulation. We will repeal and replace catastrophic Obamacare with new reforms that dramatically expand choice, substantially lower costs, and significantly improve the quality of care. And we will end the offshoring of American jobs. In my contract, I also offer a detailed plan to immediately secure the border, stop illegal immigration and keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Hillary has pledged "open borders," mass amnesty, and a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. America's immigration officers described Hillary's extremist plan as "the most radical immigration agenda proposal in U.S. history." I will restore the constitutional rule of law and nominate Supreme Court justices who will do the same. Finally, I pledge to fight for the right of every child in American to grow up in safety and peace, and undertake a national effort to bring jobs, security and prosperity to our inner cities. Together, we will take our government back from the special interests -- and we will Make America Great Again.
January 19, 2017	USA TODAY	Russia is undermining the liberal world order in its quest for influence, Vice President Biden said Wednesday in his last major speech before leaving office. Biden cited Iran and China among "the greatest threats" to the democracies built in Europe and the United States, but, he said, "I will not mince words. This movement is principally led by Russia."  "Under President (Vladimir) Putin, Russia is working with every tool available to them to whittle away at the edges of the European project, test for fault lines among western nations, and return to a politics defined by spheres of influence," Biden told an audience of CEOs, world leaders and news media gathered for the World Economic Forum. Biden cited Russia's efforts to stoke separatism in Ukraine, use of energy as a weapon and its cyber intrusions into democratic elections, and warned that Russia could use its tactics to manipulate politics in Europe. "With many countries in Europe slated to hold elections this year, we should expect further attempts by Russia to meddle in the democratic process," he said. Biden began his speech on a light note, noting he had just two days before he could "say what I think" as a simply a citizen, but quickly moved to address the economic and political unease that has inspired populist movements around the world. "In these early days of 2017, there's a palpable uncertainty about the state of our world," Biden said. "Here in this exclusive Alpine tower, where CEOs of multinational corporations rub elbows with leaders of nations, it is easy to embrace the intellectual benefits of a more open and integrated world. But it is at our own peril that we ignore or dismiss the legitimate fears and anxieties that exist in communities all across the developed world." Biden, who calls himself a "free trader" and supporter of globalization, said that business and political leaders must recognize that "globalization has not been an unalloyed good" and take steps to close the rift between those "racing ahead at the top" and those "struggling to hang on in the middle." Biden said that his comments about uncertainty and unease did not refer to the transition of power Friday as President-elect Donald Trump takes office. But he said opposition to globalization manifested in backlash against free trade and diplomacy would unravel some of the gains made by western democracies since World War II. "Popular movements on both the left and the right have demonstrated a dangerous willingness to revert to political small-mindedness -- to the same nationalist, protectionist and isolationist agendas that led the world to consume itself in war during in the last century," Biden said. "As we have seen time and again throughout history, demagogues and autocrats have emerged -- seeking to capitalize on people's insecurities." 
March 18, 2016	USA TODAY	Easing the big Bentley Bentayga away from the curb, you realize rather quickly that this SUV will be unlike any you've ever driven. Next you notice amazing power. For that, we thank the 6-liter, 12-cylinder engine -- one of the last of its gas-guzzling breed.  Love it or resent it as you may, just being in the Bentley is a rare pleasure. A chance to spend some road time in a Bentayga is akin to being accidentally locked in a Tiffany store -- an SUV fit for a Trump. It's not often that we get to take a spin in a $270,000 vehicle, including options, of any sort. Even at Bentayga's base price of $229,100, you could buy a bevy of conventional U.S. midmarket SUVs for the same outlay -- one for every day of the week. Bentayga is among the first among a new breed of super-luxury SUVs. Maserati is giving the American introduction to its new Levante SUV next week at the New York Auto Show. Rolls-Royce has its own, the Cullinan, on the way. Bentayga is filled with little delights. Note how the seats have 16-way power adjustments -- both front and back. Or how little water jets emerge from the otherwise flush front end to squirt grime off the headlights in stormy weather. It's a pleasure to drive. That amazing suspension, my seatmate from Bentley assures me, comes from a high-power computerized system that makes constant adjustments for any surface. Because it's an SUV and off-road capable, Bentayga also has a system that raises and lowers the front and rear ends to provide extra wheel clearance for tearing over sand dunes or thrashing through the snow. The process is helped along by controls on the center console that allow drivers to switch the car's terrain mode. There's also comfort, sport and other settings for regular driving. They not only stiffen or loosen the cushiness of the suspension but determine how hard it is to turn the  wheel. Bentayga's monster engine is good for 600 horsepower. It can catapult itself from zero to 60 mph in four seconds. Top speed is 187 mph. The engine, like many these days, shuts off at intersections to save fuel. And it has the ability to shut off 6 cylinders when they are not needed. Bentley boasts that it is 10.2% more fuel efficient than its existing 12-cylinder engine, which, in other Bentley models, averages 15 miles a gallon.  Bentayga's mileage rating is yet to be released for the U.S. A gas-electric hybrid option will follow. Self-driving? Sort of. The Bentley has adaptive cruise control, so it can track cars in front of it, and does a pretty good job of keeping itself centered in a lane. The interior is, as you might expect, sumptuous. Our test car was finished in a shiny "piano black" trim. With no wood grain showing, any material could have done the job. But Bentley assures that it is, yes, real wood. For the moment, Bentayga is available only as a two-row SUV. A three-row version is next. In back, Bentley has poured a lot of attention into creating options for the cargo bay. The version we tested had a nifty pull-out seat that fits over the tailgate. Our favorite option for the back would have to be the "Integrated Milliner Hamper Set," which comes with a mini-fridge, "fine Linley china cutlery" and crystal glassware. Basically, it's a picnic set straight from Downton Abbey. There are 17 stock paint colors, but the custom list takes the hues up to 90, though Americans generally will take what they see in a showroom. Bentley expects to sell about 5,000 Bentaygas a year when deliveries start by early June, about a third of them in the U.S.
July 22, 2016	USA TODAY	Completing his historic drive to the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump told a divided Republican Party on Thursday that he will be the "voice" for frustrated Americans who have been let down by government and the "elites" who run it. "Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it," Trump told a fired-up crowd of backers that packed the downtown Quicken Loans Arena.  After ascending the stage to the theme from the action film Air Force One, Trump said he "humbly and gratefully" accepted the Republican nomination to the presidency, then launched into a prepared teleprompter speech peppered with caustic asides about career politicians. In addition to promoting his own qualifications for the White House, Trump's speech was aimed at uniting a convention in which the runner-up in the primary campaign refused to endorse him, critical delegates staged a noisy floor fight over the rules, and a string of high-profile Republicans boycotted the entire event. Trump argued that the United States is in decline under the Obama administration, citing a litany of grim statistics about crime and violence, terrorism and national security, and the rising number of Americans who have stopped looking for work. Election opponent Hillary Clinton and other Democrats are to blame for many of the nation's ills, Trump said, and the problems of poverty, violence and war "will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them." Hitting the former secretary of State for foreign policy problems ranging from Libya to the rise of the Islamic State, Trump said Clinton's legacy is one of "death, destruction, terrorism and weakness." Citing the recent spate of police killings and terrorism, the businessman who has never held public office promised that "the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon, and I mean very soon, come to an end." Echoing promises he has made since hitting the campaign trail 13 months ago, Trump said he will stop illegal immigration with a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and change trade agreements that he claims have sucked manufacturing jobs out of the United States to foreign countries. He again blasted what he called the unfair trade tactics of competitors like China. While Trump in past months has proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, he said Thursday that the suspension would apply only to migrants "from any nation that has been comprised by terrorism." Throughout the day, the Clinton campaign and other Democratic groups sent out statements denouncing various Trump policies as ineffectual, divisive or simply wrong-headed and accused him of distorting Clinton's records. They also cited Republican infighting over Trump, including the refusal of many high-profile Republicans to endorse the party's new standard-bearer. In his hour-plus remarks, Trump recited a string of slogans he used at rallies across the country in the past year, including "Law and Order," "America First," a "rigged system," and -- the original campaign theme -- "Make America Great Again." The crowd responded with repeated ovations and chants like "build that wall!" and "U-S-A!" Trump himself occasionally joined in the "U-S-A" chants, flashing the crowd a thumbs-up. Mocking the pro-Clinton slogan -- "I'm With Her" -- Trump told delegates: "I'm with you, the American people: I am your voice." And as in previous rallies, Trump had to pause at one point as a protester heckled him and had to be removed by security. As Trump put the final touches on his speech and did a walk-though of the stage set-up Thursday, he took to Twitter to proclaim the convention a success. "Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is VERY united," Trump tweeted. "Great love in the arena!" Daughter Ivanka Trump introduced her father to the noisy crowd that packed Cleveland's basketball arena, telling them he is a "fighter" who became "the people's nominee." Ahead of Trump's big night a flap arose over his commitment to U.S. military alliances, including NATO. When The New York Times asked the candidate about the prospect of a Russian attack on NATO allies in the Baltic States, Trump said he would authorize help only after deciding whether those countries "have fulfilled their obligations to us." Republicans who have questioned Trump's grasp of foreign policy reacted with indignation. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Trump "is essentially telling Russians/other bad actors" that the United States "is not fully committed to supporting NATO alliance." Trump's convention ends a day after ex-primary rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas refused to endorse the party's nominee during his convention speech, inciting a chorus of boos from pro-Trump delegates. At a meeting of the Texas delegation Thursday, Cruz noted Trump has criticized his wife's looks and all but accused his dad of participating in a plot to assassinate President John F. Kennedy. "I wasn't going to come like a servile puppy dog and say 'Thank you very much' for maligning my wife and father," Cruz said. 
December 7, 2016	USA TODAY	When Donald Trump accepted a phone call from Taiwan's president, he signaled to China that he is prepared not only to break with longtime U.S. policy but also to launch U.S.-Chinese relations on a more confrontational course. The conversation with President Tsai Ing-wen was the first by a U.S. president or president-elect since 1979, when Jimmy Carter ended official relations with Taiwan after recognizing Beijing's communist government as the only representative of China. Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province that it plans someday to unify with the mainland.  Beyond upsetting Beijing with his call, Trump has accused China of unfair trade and exerting new military muscle in Asia. Trump's conversation with Taiwan's democratically elected president is too important for China's communist leaders to ignore, said Michael Auslin, author of the soon-to-be published book The End of the Asian Century. China's "One China" policy is "all about separatism," Auslin said. If Taiwan can move toward independence, as many on the island want, then so can Tibet and Xinjiang, he said of Tibetan- and Muslim-majority regions in China with separatist movements. China can show its displeasure with the United States in areas such as economics, anti-terrorism and North Korea's nuclear program, said Cheng Li, director of the China program at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank. China can ratchet up military activities in the South China Sea, where the United States seeks to maintain freedom of navigation for commercial and  Navy ships. China's neighbors resist its territorial claims, as well. Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Trump's advisers are trying "to show China that things won't be conducted business as usual. ... Trump seems to have bought into this." After his phone call with Taiwan's leader, Trump tweeted, "Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into ... their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? I don't think so!" Trump's tweet links separate areas of conflict with China in a new way, but China can play that game, too. In the South China Sea, China has built islands on atolls and rocks and added hardened aircraft hangars and shipping piers. U.S. allies in the area have protested, and the United States has used its ships and military aircraft to enforce free access for all. "Until now, (the Chinese) have said these aren't military bases," Auslin said. "To show Trump he's going down the wrong road, I wouldn't be surprised if they say these are bases and base fighter planes on them." China could deploy radar and anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, demand that foreign aircraft and vessels identify themselves in the area and bar access to military craft and ships from the USA and other nations. "Are these small countries going to risk an encounter with Chinese fighter jets?" Auslin said. "It makes China the regional (superpower) and forces the U.S. to decide whether they're going to challenge China." China signed on to international sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council last week in response to North Korea's nuclear weapons tests, but it could walk away from them, Auslin said. It could boost economic and military aid to North Korea, an ally wholly dependent on China, and declare an end to international talks to end the North's nuclear program. "They could use it as a stick to beat Trump with," Auslin said. Trump could respond by ramping up pressure with more sanctions on Chinese companies that support North Korea and its nuclear activities. President Obama issued the first such sanctions in September. "Trump could do more," Glaser said. Trump says China dumps steel and other imports at low prices to put competitors out of business, violates intellectual property rights and manipulates its currency to lower the cost of its products and make U.S. goods more expensive in China. This is one area where the Chinese "are more vulnerable than we are," Auslin said. "We can find other markets. They are less able to find other markets the size of the USA." Trump has threatened to declare China a currency manipulator. That determination could result in tariffs on Chinese imports and a trade war, Auslin said. China's economy would suffer, and the cost of goods would go up for U.S. consumers. China could respond by refusing to buy U.S. Treasury bonds. That would hike U.S. government borrowing costs, raise interest rates on U.S. consumers and businesses and spook the stock market. University of Maryland economist Phillip Swagel sees a trade war and a currency war with China on the horizon because China's currency will continue to fall, while Trump's plan to cut taxes and increase spending will make the dollar stronger. Swagel said that would open opportunities for Trump to expand trade elsewhere in Asia. "I wonder if the China bashing produces gains in other places," he said. "He could portray it as shoring up Japan against China." 
June 22, 2016	USA TODAY	Hillary Clinton painted Donald Trump's ideas and temperament as a dangerous combination that could lead to another recession, in a swing-state speech extending her critique of the presumptive GOP nominee's fitness to serve as president. "Just as he shouldn't have his finger on the button, he shouldn't have his hands on our economy," Clinton told nearly 300 people in a speech in Columbus, Ohio, on Tuesday. Despite his success as a businessman, Trump "would throw us back into recession," the presumptive Democratic nominee said.  Trump's pugnacious personality is one lens through which Clinton's campaign is building its case against the real estate mogul. In her speech Tuesday -- heavy with "and I quote" references to Trump's words -- Clinton rebutted idea after idea Trump has proposed, seeking to show his business experience doesn't translate to strong proposals for the country's economy. Trump would wipe out post-crash rules on banks, give sweeping tax cuts that could widen deficits, cancel trade deals and deport immigrants in the USA without documentation, leading to uncertainty and economic disaster, Clinton said. "The full faith and credit of the United States is not something we just gamble away," she said. "The United States of America doesn't do business Trump's way. And it matters when a presidential candidate talks like this, because the world hangs on every word our president says. ... Someone should tell him our nation's economy isn't a game." Much like in a recent speech in San Diego in which Clinton deemed Trump "temperamentally unfit" to lead the nation in foreign affairs, she warned that Trump's policies and leadership approach would pose a danger to American economic security. Trump's campaign responded to Clinton in a barrage of emails and tweets, unusual in their resemblance to typical campaign "opposition" from aides. "Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs," Trump said in one tweet. The billionaire's policies would grow jobs by lifting regulations on businesses and energy production and by enforcing penalties for other countries' currency manipulation and intellectual property theft, his campaign said in an email. Another email quoted from a book by a former Secret Service agent, calling Clinton "volcanic, impulsive, enabled by sycophants, and disdainful of the rules set for everyone else." Clinton attacked Trump for having a predilection for playing with debt, warning he would bankrupt the country like he did his casinos in Atlantic City. A trail of thousands of lawsuits, including those involving his defunct Trump University and others involving unpaid bills, show that Trump makes "over-the-top promises" to people that fall apart, she said. "People get hurt," Clinton said. "He's written a lot of books about business. They all seem to end at Chapter 11." In a tweet, Trump countered he would approach the U.S. economy differently than he approached his business. "I am 'the king of debt,'" he tweeted. "That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S." Clinton first previewed Tuesday's approach in an interview last week with USA TODAY. Her senior adviser, Jake Sullivan, echoed those themes in a statement Monday night. "Everything that applies to Trump about national security is equally true when it comes to the economy," Sullivan said. "If we were to put Donald Trump behind the wheel of the American economy, he would very likely drive us off a cliff and working families would bear the brunt of the impact in terms of lost jobs, lost savings and lost livelihoods," Sullivan said. He pointed to a new report from Moody's Analytics finding that the economy "will be significantly weaker" if Trump's economic proposals were to be adopted. The report predicted stagnant incomes, a "lengthy recession" and stock and real house value declines. Clinton will outline her own economic vision in a separate speech Wednesday in Raleigh, N.C. according to the campaign. The presumptive Democratic nominee blasted Trump on Tuesday for not releasing his tax returns. "You have to ask yourself, what's he afraid of?" Clinton said. "Maybe he isn't as rich as he claims." Clinton suggested Trump might not have paid much in taxes or might not have given much money to charity. Clinton stated her economic case against Trump in Ohio, the quintessential swing state. A poll Tuesday morning showed her tied with the real estate mogul in a two-way Ohio race: Each candidate got 40%. Clinton trailed Trump by 4 points in the same poll a month earlier. Part of the survey was conducted before the Orlando shooting. Some Ohio Republicans have been slow to support Trump, who lost to Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the state's GOP primary.
January 24, 2017	USA TODAY	The clock's ticking on Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, and if the post-election stock market rally is to continue, the nation's 45th president must now make good on promises to enact policies that will make it easier for U.S. companies to profit and prosper and American workers to better share in the prosperity, investors say. "He has to start delivering," says Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. "How much time the market will give him amid the high expectations, I don't know."  The 6.2% gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index from Election Day to Trump's inauguration Friday -- the fourth-best  rally for a president-elect -- was driven largely by speculation about Trump's promise to slash the federal tax rate for U.S. companies and to push for deregulation to boost corporate profitability. Monday, Trump met with top CEOs at the White House, reiterating his "America First"  blueprint and sending a clear message that boosting the U.S. economy is a top priority. Trump said he plans to "cut taxes massively" for corporations and the middle class and pare back business regulations "by 75% and maybe more." But when it comes to the stock market, which is moving into more of a "show-me" mode, Trump's promises of things to come carries less weight now. Investors have become more skeptical as to how much of Trump's agenda will come to fruition. Those concerns are reflected in the stalling out of the "Trump rally." The S&P 500 has slipped roughly 1% since its Jan. 6 record close and has posted losses the past two weeks. The index was down 0.4% Monday despite Trump's latest promises. "The market got ahead of itself with all the Trump euphoria," says Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer at First America Trust. Now, Wall Street wants to see details about how big a tax cut corporations will actually get. Trump said Monday he sees the corporate tax rate, now 35%, falling to 15% to 20%, which is lower than a plan laid out by fellow Republicans. Investors want to know how big an infrastructure bill Trump can get passed and how quickly. Wall Street also wants more details on what types of changes Trump is seeking from his plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which Trump says has resulted in U.S. jobs fleeing to Mexico and Canada. A big question is whether Trump's main focus is what Wall Street perceives as his more market-friendly plans, such as lowering taxes, bolstering fiscal spending and paring back regulations on businesses while keeping consumer protections in place, says Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Or the more bearish Trump policies, such as imposing border taxes on imports to the U.S., and other moves perceived as anti-free trade, such as branding China a "currency manipulator." "If they get tax reform, fiscal spending and repatriation of foreign profits done, it will be good for the market," Arone says. "But if Trump ... labels China a currency manipulator, or talks about trade restrictions and tariffs that could prove problematic for the U.S. and the global economy, that would give me pause." 
December 8, 2016	USA TODAY	President-elect Donald Trump nominated Iowa's governor to be ambassador to China, picked a retired general to be his secretary of Homeland Security, and tapped Oklahoma's attorney general for the Environmental Protection Agency, officials said Wednesday.  Trump also said Wednesday he will nominate Linda McMahon -- co-founder of the WWE pro wrestling empire -- to be the leader of his Small Business Administration. Trump  will return to the campaign trail, aides said, weighing in on the Louisiana U.S. Senate race by appearing at a campaign rally Friday in Baton Rouge. Trump later confirmed plans to nominate Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as the U.S. ambassador to China, a nation Trump has been feuding with in recent days. In a statement, Trump said Branstad "successfully developed close trade ties with China while serving as chief executive of the Hawkeye State." Branstad, who called Chinese President Xi Jinping "an old friend," said in a statement that he looks forward to "building on our long friendship to cultivate and strengthen the relationship between our two countries and to benefit our economy." Another major appointment in the offing: retired Marine Corps general John Kelly for the department of Homeland Security, according to a person close to the transition speaking on condition of anonymity pending a formal announcement. Trump's job interviews Wednesday included a second round with Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who will be nominated to administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency -- an agency he has sued. As a state official, Pruitt has taken the Obama administration to court over a variety of environmental and other regulations. "Mr. Pruitt led Oklahoma's legal challenges to the EPA, Obamacare, executive actions on illegal immigration, Dodd-Frank and President Obama's repeated attempts to bypass Congress," transition spokesman Jason Miller said. "Attorney General Pruitt has a strong conservative record as a state prosecutor and has demonstrated a familiarity with laws and regulations impacting a large energy resource state." Environmental groups already are lining up against Pruitt, noting that he is supporter of fracking despite its link to a rise of earthquakes in Oklahoma. Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, said that "Scott Pruitt running the EPA is like the fox guarding the henhouse. Time and again, he has fought to pad the profits of Big Polluters at the expense of public health." Miller also said Trump will attend a  rally Friday in Baton Rouge on behalf of Louisiana Senate candidate John Kennedy. The spokesman said that Trump wants "another Republican vote in the United States Senate." The president-elect said he continues to consider 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney for secretary of State, and he rejected suggestions that he is stringing out the process in order to mock Romney. "No, it's not about revenge," Trump told NBC. "It's about what's good for the country. And I'm able to put this stuff behind us." 
January 19, 2017	USA TODAY	Wilbur Ross, the billionaire financier nominated by Donald Trump to be secretary of Commerce, said Wednesday that he would pursue more treaties with individual trading partner nations and vowed to crack down on trade agreement violators, singling out China repeatedly. "I am pro-trade. But I am pro-sensible trade, not trade that is detrimental to the American worker and to the domestic manufacturing base," Ross said before the U.S. Senate's Commerce, Science & Transportation Committee, which will deliberate on his nomination.  Trump's tough talk on trade -- including threats of high tariffs and renegotiating trade deals -- has unnerved economists and exporting companies that fear retaliation. But Ross sought to sell the idea that more bilateral agreements, which are "easier and quicker to negotiate" than the ones involving multiple countries, can boost exports. Negotiating with a dozen countries for a trade agreement will result in multiple and unintended concessions, he said. "The more complex the environment in which you negotiate, the less likely you'll get sensible results," he said. "You take a lot of nicks." China "is the most protectionist country among very large countries," Ross told the lawmakers in the committee. "They actually talk more about free trade than they practice. We'd like to level the playing field." His hearing, which was scheduled for last week, had been delayed to give Ross more time to complete the ethics and financial disclosure forms that are required. Several other confirmation hearings are scheduled this week -- including one Thursday for Steven Mnuchin, the nominee for Treasury secretary -- before Trump is sworn in Friday. If confirmed, Ross will head the key executive branch agency that enforces American trade policies, generates 40% of publicly available federal government data, manages patents, oversees the nation's wireless spectrum, operates the Census and monitors the conditions of the oceans and the atmosphere. But his nomination primarily signals Trump's oft-stated plans to re-examine global trade and bring private-sector experts to produce more jobs and favorable trade terms for U.S. companies. And Ross' role is expected to be expanded  beyond the traditional parameters of Commerce secretary so he can work with other trade officials. "I've made my livelihood for over five decades dealing in international commerce," Ross said. "I think I've probably had more direct experience than any prior Cabinet nominee has had with unfair trade in the steel business, in the textile business, in the auto parts business and other sectors." Ross, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes to be about $2.9 billion, made his fortune in private equity. Hailed as "the king of bankruptcy," he bought struggling companies and overhauled their operations, often leading to layoffs, before selling them at hefty profit margins. Ross defended the work of his investment firm, WL Ross & Co., pointing to jobs saved in rescuing companies that may have otherwise been liquidated. Tuesday, Reuters reported the companies controlled by his firm eliminated about 2,700 jobs since 2004 in the textile, finance and auto-parts industries. In his filing with the Office of Government Ethics posted Tuesday, Ross disclosed plans to sell about 80 assets in the coming months to avoid conflicts of interest. He will also step down from dozens of companies and organizations he's involved in as investor and board member. Ross declined to say whether Trump should follow suit and divest holdings, saying the rules are different for presidents and that he didn't have the "exactitude" of Trump's financials to give an opinion. Ross and Trump have known each other for decades. Ross lives in a Palm Beach estate with his third wife, not far from Trump's Mar-a-Lago club. In 1990, Ross, then working as head of Rothschild Investment's bankruptcy advisory practice, represented a group of bondholders who were looking to have Trump's Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City declare bankruptcy after it missed a bond payment. Ross and Trump eventually worked out a bankruptcy transaction to keep the casino running. Ross then formed his own private equity firm in 2000 with $440 million in investor money. In the early 2000s, he acquired the factories of Pennsylvania's Bethlehem Steel, Cleveland-based LTV and other manufacturers and consolidated them into a new company, International Steel Group. It was then sold to Mittal Steel for $4.5 billion in 2004. In keeping with Trump's recent Twitter announcements and campaign rhetoric across the Rust Belt states, Ross echoed Trump's message about restoring jobs in the industries that have been affected by trade and automation. The North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade deals will be reviewed. And he's also in favor of "automatic reopening" of trade agreements after a few years to gauge effectiveness and changes that need to be made. "We should not put up with malicious trading activities, state-owned enterprises or subsidized production," he said. China was mentioned frequently by lawmakers, and Ross was blunt in his assessment of the country as a difficult trading partner. He was particularly critical of China's non-tariff barriers, saying he had been exposed to them while running his companies.
December 21, 2016	USA TODAY	Democrats beyond a certain age, reeling from the recent president election, might recall the enmity and contempt with which they viewed another polarizing president, Richard Nixon. And perhaps they take some solace from the fact that after they suffered under his rule for more than five years, Nixon was driven from office -- forced to resign in 1974 because of his wanton disregard for basic principles of America's democracy. Now they have another reason to be angry at him: Surprisingly, Nixon was an early booster of Donald Trump's career in politics. Back in 1987, in a personally addressed and signed note, the disgraced former president lauded a Trump TV performance and cited his wife's belief that whenever Trump decided to run for office, he'd win.  Did this note put the idea that he could be president into Trump's head? Probably not -- but it certainly must have reinforced whatever notions might already have been brewing there. And Trump prizes the letter. He recently told friends he plans to hang it in the Oval Office. Trump would be wise to eschew Nixon's flagrant disregard for the Constitution, and to steer away from the racism evident on the Nixon tapes and the racial elements of Nixon's "Southern strategy." Nonetheless, he could draw some positive lessons from this Republican president's foreign policy choices. Though Nixon built his career through fervent anti-communism, he was a realist when it came to foreign affairs. Recognizing that communist China was here to stay, and a potential strategic ally in the Cold War with the Soviet Union, Nixon's decision to open relations with "Red China" was a masterstroke. During Trump's campaign, he spoke harshly, to put it politely, about China. But China isn't going away; it will only get stronger over the years. Far better to work out our economic and political differences with Chinese leaders than to drive them back into close alliance with Russia. Nixon also was realistic about the limits of U.S. military power. He tried desperately to win the Vietnam War or negotiate a favorable peace during his early years in office. When it became clear that the war was unwinnable on the battlefield and at the negotiating table in Paris, however, he drew down U.S. troops and negotiated a peace that at best allowed a "decent interval" before the U.S. ally's defeat became inevitable. Trump has generally been cautious about U.S. involvement in the many conflicts in the Middle East: That's not the case with many of the individuals who appear slated for high positions in his administration. The new president would be wise to follow his own instincts and avoid new or deeper involvements in the region. Most important, he should not allow his aides to draw the U.S. into a war with Iran. The existential threat of nuclear war provides another example of Nixon's realism. Even while confronting the Soviet Union, he was willing to talk with Soviet leaders about ways to reduce nuclear dangers. This led not only to understandings between the two nations' armed forces about protocols to avoid inadvertent conflict, but also to the first U.S.-Russia arms control agreements. He negotiated Strategic Arms Limitation Talks I, which for the first time placed numerical limits on the two countries' long-range nuclear forces, as well as the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which put tight limits on both countries' missile defenses. Trump has stated that he believes he can "deal" with Russian President Vladimir Putin. One good place to start would be with nuclear issues, as that evil genie seems to have been creeping out of its bottle in recent years. Trump might have drawn political inspiration from the late Richard Nixon. He should definitely draw on the 37th president's good instincts in foreign policy. His place in history, to say nothing of the United States, would be far better for it.
December 29, 2016	USA TODAY	It was quite a year. We said hello to President-elect Donald Trump. We said goodbye to Prince, Muhammad Ali and John Glenn. We saw the power of peaceful protest at Standing Rock. And we saw the power of hate and gun violence, once again, this time at a gay nightclub in Orlando. We listened as an anonymous survivor of a sexual assault by a Stanford swimmer changed the national conversation on rape. We witnessed history as the first Latina was elected to the Senate. There was unspeakable loss and times that affirmed our faith in America. As 2016 comes to a close, USA TODAY revisits one story from each state -- the big news, the best investigations and the moments we can't stop talking about. Harper Lee, among America's  most influential authors, died Feb. 19 in her  hometown,  Monroeville, Ala. To Kill a Mockingbird -- about a lawyer who defends a black man falsely accused of rape in the Jim Crow South -- won the 1961 Pulitzer Prize, sold more than 30million copies in English, is taught in schools  and has inspired artists from Truman Capote to Taylor Swift. "What that one story did, more powerfully than 100 speeches possibly could, was change the way we saw each other and then the way we saw ourselves. Through the uncorrupted eyes of a child, she showed us the beautiful complexity of our common humanity and the importance of striving for justice," President Obama said in awarding  Lee a National Medal of the Arts in 2011. Mockingbird was her  only novel until 2015's Go Set a Watchman, which, despite tepid reviews, reaffirmed her as a stalwart anti-racist. Alaska was so warm this year, snow was shipped in for the Iditarod sled dog race, ice melt forced polar bears into the paths of schoolchildren, and the state saw its biggest landslide in decades, partly due to retreating glaciers. Here, climate change is not abstract -- especially in the state's western corner, where people's relationship with nature is a matter of life and death. Sheriff Joe Arpaio, aka "America's toughest sheriff," was criminally charged with contempt of court in October. In November, he lost his election, defeated after 24 years in office. Known nationally for immigration crackdowns and racial profiling, advocates for migrants celebrated. "Sheriff Arpaio didn't lose by coincidence; he was taken down by the people he hunted," Carlos Garcia said. Not one to leave quietly, Arpaio renewed his claim Dec. 15 that President Obama's birth certificate was forged (a theory  debunked by fact-checkers and ultimately  abandoned by  Trump). TLC may have pulled the plug in 2015 on its hit series 19 Kids and Counting after  the revelation Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar's son, Josh, sexually molested five young girls, including his own sisters, but in 2016, the Duggar family still made headlines. This year: Jinger Duggar married soccer player Jeremy Vuolo. Jessa and husband, Ben Seewald, announced they're expecting a  second child. So did Jill. And Josh Duggar got out of rehab and returned to Arkansas, months after he'd checked into a "faith-based" facility in Illinois. Her words were raw and excruciating. "You don't know me, but you've been inside me, and that's why we're here today," said Emily Doe, the anonymous victim of a sexual assault in 2015 by Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner. The powerful impact statement she read in court gave voice to sexual assault victims and forced the nation to have an important conversation about rape culture. Turner, who assaulted Doe near a trash bin while she was unconscious, was sentenced to six months in prison, a seemingly lenient punishment that drew national outrage. He  served only three months. In the aftermath of the case, California passed a law requiring longer sentences to be served in state prison for defendants convicted of assaulting unconscious victims. Doe was named one of Glamour magazine's 2016 Women of the Year. Future Hall of Famer Peyton Manning capped  an  18-year career by winning Super Bowl 50 in his final NFL game -- propelling the Denver Broncos to a 24-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers. Like Broncos president and former Denver QB John Elway, Manning retired  as a champion. He became the oldest quarterback to start a Super Bowl and the first to win Super Bowls with multiple franchises. Gun violence can be stopped if you know what to look for. That's the message of the ad  "Evan," which went viral this year. A  folk song sets the tone for a romance that unfolds with expert pacing. Then it  comes to a shattering halt. The spot is from the Sandy Hook Promise, a non-partisan, non-profit group launched by families who lost loved ones four years ago in Newtown. Joe Biden, a former Delaware senator and  two-term vice president, said he's not ruling out anything -- including a run for the White House -- as Democrats look to the future after a stinging election. Biden ran for president in 1988 and 2008. In announcing his decision not to run for 2016, a grieving Biden, whose son, Beau, died of brain cancer at age 46 in 2015, said the country needed "a moonshot" to cure cancer. President Obama put him in charge of that initiative in January. Omar Mateen's voice went from emotionless to frenzied, speaking with police negotiators  June 12. Referencing U.S. airstrikes in the Middle East, Mateen, 29, of Fort Pierce  killed 49 and left dozens injured at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, in one of the deadliest shooting rampages  in U.S. history. He was killed after a three-hour standoff. After initial plans to turn Pulse into a  memorial, owners recently decided to keep the LGBT club. Prosecutors said he knew his 22-month-old son sweltered in a hot car for seven hours. The jury agreed. Justin Ross Harris was found guilty in November on all charges in the  death of son Cooper in 2014. Prosecutors argued  that Harris wanted to live a child-free life. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole plus 32 years. More than seven decades after Japanese forces struck the heart of the  Navy's Pacific Fleet in a fiery ambush at Pearl Harbor, thousands of veterans, military officials, dignitaries and a dwindling number of survivors gathered there Dec. 7 to remember the dead and the start of a war that changed the world.  Pearl Harbor gave birth to the "Greatest Generation," said Tom Brokaw. Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe toured the site with President Obama, marking the first formal visit by a Japanese leader. We trust them with our kids, but what don't we know about teachers' troubled pasts? A USA TODAY Network investigation found flaws in the nation's fractured systems for checking teachers' backgrounds. Several teachers have left or been removed from positions after misconduct came to light, including Idaho high school teacher James P. Verity. Verity lost his teaching license in Oregon over allegations of a sexually charged relationship with an 18-year-old student but found a fresh start teaching  in neighboring Idaho. The  investigation prompted a state-by-state audit of a privately run database of disciplined teachers. Gun violence defies comprehension in Chicago. In 2016, the nation's third-largest city surpassed 700 murders. There is no shortage of maladies plaguing Chicago. It is mired in billions of dollars of debt, unemployment for young black men hovers just below 50%, and Chicago's African-American population has plummeted by nearly 200,000 since 2000 as the black middle class has looked for greener -- and safer -- pastures. The city blames the violence on a combination of increased gang activity and weak gun laws, but anti-violence activists point to a lack of economic opportunity. Diane Latiker, who heads the Chicago organization Kids Off the Block, said, "Chicago has long been one of a Tale of Two Cities. Nothing has changed." The issue of sexual misconduct by coaches has haunted USA Gymnastics for decades, but an  investigation by The Indianapolis Star  revealed the organization's  policies enabled predatory coaches to continue working with children, despite warnings of misconduct. At least 368 gymnasts have alleged some form of sexual abuse at the hands of their coaches, gym owners and other adults working in gymnastics. And it's likely an undercount. He helped deliver Iowa's electoral votes to Donald Trump.  Gov. Terry Branstad will serve the new administration as U.S. ambassador to China. Branstad  has known Chinese President Xi Jinping since 1985, when Xi visited Iowa on an agricultural mission, and considers him "an old friend." He's conducted numerous trade missions to China to promote Iowa agriculture products. Branstad, 70, is the longest-serving governor in U.S. history, serving four terms from 1983 to 1999 and a term and a half since 2011. It was called Verrückt, the German word for crazy or insane. At 168 feet high, it was taller than Niagara Falls and the Statue of Liberty. Officials announced the ride would be demolished after  the death of Caleb Schwab, 10,  son of Rep. Scott Schwab. Caleb died from a fatal neck injury  suffered on the ride in August at the Schlitterbahn Water Park in Kansas City. The ride propelled rafts with two to three riders at speeds of up to 65 mph. The world mourned when boxing legend and Louisville native Muhammad Ali died June 3 at  age  74. Ali was an Olympic gold medalist and three-time heavyweight champion,  but he was so much more. His flair in the ring ("Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee!") and genius for trash talking ("I'm so mean, I make medicine sick") won him worldwide celebrity. At the height of his fame, he became a leading civil rights and anti-war voice. His opposition to the Vietnam War in 1967 cost him the belt and led to a three-year ban from boxing. After retiring, Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1984. Even in illness, Ali was an inspiration, his trembling hands lighting the Olympic torch for the 1996 Atlanta Games. His Louisville funeral was attended by thousands, including former president Bill Clinton, who saluted him as a "universal soldier for humanity." While America descended from its  Olympics high and focused on the  presidential election, Louisianans were fighting for survival. In August, the Southern state experienced  flooding so horrific that the Red Cross called it the worst natural disaster since Superstorm  Sandy. About 40,000 homes and 13 lives were lost.  The lack of national interest in the flood could be because Americans are becoming numb to the onslaught of human suffering. "There is a bit of disaster fatigue," says Susan Moeller, professor of media and international affairs at the University of Maryland. Although  Maine narrowly voted in favor of legalizing marijuana in November, those opposing the measure aimed to snuff out the flame. If a recount, which could take until January, upholds passage, Maine will follow  Massachusetts to  become the second Northeastern state to legalize marijuana. The law would allow adults to have up to six mature plants, 12 immature plants and an unlimited number of seedlings without a state license. He didn't go out the way he wanted: David Ortiz, the 6-foot-3 Red Sox slugger from the Dominican Republic, ended his 20-year career in a sweep to the Cleveland Indians in October. It wasn't long, though, before chants of "Thank you, Papi," began, and Ortiz saluted the city he came to embody. After joining the Red Sox in 2003, Ortiz brought three World Series rings to Boston in nine years, including its first in eight decades. He became the city's voice, delivering a defiant, legendary speech in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing. He'll go down as one of the greatest Red Sox players of all time -- perhaps the most important. President Obama declared a state of emergency in Flint, Mich., in January, but the city's water still isn't safe to drink without  a filter. Lead levels spiked after the city swapped water suppliers in 2014. The state skipped necessary anti-corrosion treatments, letting lead leach from miles of old service pipes into residents' taps. Everyone who drank the city's tap water was exposed, including as many as 8,657 children, Census data showed. The harmful impacts are considered most severe on young brains and nervous systems. In one of its last votes of the year, Congress approved legislation worth more than $120 million to deal with the  crisis. When music legend Prince died in April, it seemed as though the whole world stopped to mourn. The pop icon blended funk and rock with his own fierce individualism, winning seven Grammys, one Oscar and a spot in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. His body was found in an elevator at his estate in suburban Minneapolis. The cause: an accidental, self-inflicted overdose of a painkiller. The singer didn't have a will, leaving the fate of his fortune to play out in court.  Fans celebrated the sassy prodigy who created Purple Rain, Let's Go Crazy and When Doves Cry -- all on a single album. Prince album sales rose 11,500% the week after his death, per Nielsen data. It was a story one could hardly believe was written in 2016. One or more white students placed a noose around the neck of a black football player at the Stone High School in Wiggins, a small town near Biloxi. The NAACP said the  incident happened in October during a break in football practice, and the noose was "yanked backward" while on the student's neck. "This is 2016, not 1916. This is America," said Mississippi NAACP President Derrick Johnson. Days later, a student was disciplined, according to the school district's lawyer, who could not name the student or the specific punishment, citing privacy rules. After 21 years in St. Louis, Rams fans learned in January their beloved franchise officially would move back to Los Angeles. Builders broke ground on Rams owner Stan Kroenke's $2.6billion Inglewood stadium project in November. It will include an entertainment, retail and office development covering nearly 300 acres near the L.A. airport. "I think this is going to be one of the greatest complexes in the world," NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said of the Inglewood plan.  The Rams are 4-10 and recently fired coach Jeff Fisher.  That seems to be OK with some locals. "Whoever they play, I'm rooting against them," St. Louis-area resident Peter Mueller, 22, said as he watched the L.A. Rams in September. President-elect Donald Trump nominated Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke to lead the Interior Department in December, saying the former Navy SEAL strikes the right balance between protecting the nation's natural resources and overly onerous federal regulations. Trump said, "America is the most beautiful country in the world, and he is going to help keep it that way with smart management of our federal lands." Zinke said he is honored by the nomination, describing himself "as someone who grew up in a logging and rail town and hiking in Glacier National Park." The horrific death of Lane Graves, a  Nebraska toddler killed after an alligator pulled him into a lagoon at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort in June, tugged on every parent's heartstrings. Matt and Melissa Graves were enjoying  vacation when a 7- to 8-foot gator  emerged from the man-made lake and grabbed Lane, 2, as he played in about a foot of water. A report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission found that the boy did not do anything to provoke the alligator -- in fact, the report highlighted how other park visitors alerted Disney employees about seeing gators in the area. Since the attack, Disney has posted additional warning signs around the park and built fences and other barriers around some waterfront areas. Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto became the first woman to represent Nevada in the U.S. Senate -- and the first Latina in the chamber's history --  after defeating Republican Rep. Joe Heck in a tight race in November. The contest -- which brought in more than $90million in outside money -- keeps the seat in Democratic hands after Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid decided not to seek a sixth term after serving nearly 30 years in the Senate. In New Hampshire, the heroin and opiate epidemic is a public health crisis. "I have never seen anything like this," Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., said during an appearance  this year before the Senate Judiciary Committee. "This is about real people dying." Although opioid and heroin addiction have earned the distinction as the greatest drug threat in the USA, the federal government's effort to counter it has been spotty. "The biggest area where we have fallen short is filling the gap between people who need treatment and those able to get it," said Michael Botticelli, director of the National Drug Control Policy. White House officials are  moving quickly to get $500 million flowing into the hardest-hit areas since  President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act in December to tackle the public health crisis. Freddie Gray, 25, died of neck injuries  sustained while shackled and handcuffed without a seat belt in the back of a police car in April 2015. After Gray's funeral, protests broke out across the city, and rioting resulted in buildings burned to the ground. After Baltimore's medical examiner determined Gray's death was a homicide, many residents wanted the six indicted officers to pay.  Judge Barry Williams acquitted three of the officers, including the van's driver and the highest-ranking officer. On July 27,  charges against the three remaining officers accused in the death of Gray were dropped, bringing an end to a tumultuous criminal case with zero convictions. Two former associates of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took the fall for a politically motivated bridge shutdown that ensnared motorists in a massive traffic jam three years ago in Fort Lee. A jury found Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, guilty of charges tied to the George W. Bridge closure, which was considered payback after Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, refused to endorse the governor for re-election. During their six-week trial, the associates suggested Christie knew early on about the closure, which left motorists stranded and streets packed for five days. Baroni and Kelly are scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 21. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump vowed not to settle the class-action lawsuits against Trump University, saying, "I don't want to settle cases when we're right." But on Nov. 18, a little more than a week after winning the election, the president-elect agreed to settle fraud cases involving Trump University for $25 million. The deal does not require Trump to acknowledge wrongdoing.  The cases included a lawsuit by New York state and two class-action suits in California against the university, which promised to reveal Trump's real estate investing "secrets" to those who enrolled.  The New York attorney general's fraud lawsuit described the defunct university as a scam that lured aspiring real estate developers, requiring them to shell out up to $35,000. Ashlynne Mike, 11, and her brother Ian, 9, were near their home in Lower Fruitland on May 2 when a man lured them into his van. He drove them into the New Mexico desert where he molested Ashlynne and bludgeoned her to death with a tire iron. Ian, who was released, was found walking along Navajo Route 13. Ashlynne's family discovered her body the next morning in the desert. Suspect Tom Begaye Jr., who police said confessed, was charged with first-degree murder, felony murder, kidnapping resulting in death, two counts of aggravated sexual abuse resulting in death and two counts of kidnapping of a minor. In a few frantic seconds, something tragic happened on what might  have been an ordinary weekday afternoon in Charlotte. Plainclothes officers intending to serve a warrant Sept. 20 on someone else at an apartment complex spotted a person with a gun, they said. They confronted Keith Lamont Scott as  he waited for his son's school bus, family and friends said. Scott's wife, coming from their nearby apartment, captured video footage, in which four shots can be heard. "Did you shoot him?" she demanded of officer Brent Vinson. Police and prosecutors said Vinson was justified in shooting because Scott threatened the officers with a gun, or  appeared to. Charlotte grappled with several nights of protests as another fatal police shooting sprang into the national consciousness. Find another way. That's what government engineers said Dec. 4 to builders of the 1,172-mile Dakota Access pipeline project. It was a victory for demonstrators who had gathered since  spring to protest planned construction of the nearly complete oil pipe under a lake at the edge of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, about 30 miles south of Bismarck. The protest was the longest in recent history, as well as the largest gathering of Native Americans in modern times. Law enforcement officers used tear gas and  water cannons on the cold but determined crowds. Many of them lived in a sprawling camp of teepees, mobile homes and cars. Sioux protesters got support from people around the country, including veterans, who came in as reinforcements. But the dispute is not over: Pipeline builder Energy Transfer Partners said it doesn't want to reroute the segment and blasted the Obama administration. It's unclear whether things could change under the incoming Trump administration. John Glenn left Earth for a third and final time Dec. 8, when the Ohio-born, space-race hero died at 95. Glenn  was a decorated fighter pilot who flew scores of missions in World War II and the Korean War. As a test pilot, he set a transcontinental speed record. He was a CEO of Royal Crown Cola. He served four terms in the U.S. Senate, taking a spin as a presidential candidate in 1984. Not to mention the Cambridge-born, New Concord-raised nice guy  was the first American to orbit the planet, circling that big blue ball three times before his risky, dramatic re-entry in the Friendship 7 spacecraft Feb. 20, 1962. In 1998, he orbited Earth again in the space shuttle Discovery, becoming the oldest person ever in space, at 77. As a fellow, pioneering Mercury astronaut radioed on the Friendship mission in 1962, "Godspeed, John Glenn." Oklahoma opened 2016 with a swarm of 70 small earthquakes in one week after jumping from two earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or higher in 2008 to 890 in 2015. In March, the U.S. Geological Survey released a report citing the oil and gas drilling process as the cause. The USGS blamed wastewater disposal, in which high-pressure water is injected into rock formations underground. Oil and gas companies argued that the vast majority of wells cause no problems. Despite depending on the industry for jobs and taxes, Oklahoma strengthened regulations, and the rate of quakes has declined. Lawsuits against several petroleum companies are pending over damage caused by the earthquakes. On Jan. 2, a group of armed anti-government activists led by rancher Ammon Bundy, below, rang in the new year by seizing a federal building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. They said tough restrictions on grazing and other uses of federal land threaten their way of life. The ensuing standoff with authorities lasted more than a month. When Bundy and several others tried to leave the compound to attend a community meeting, law enforcement officials moved in. During the arrest, Robert "Lavoy" Finicum, the group's de facto spokesman, was fatally shot. Bundy, his brother  and five other leaders of the occupation were acquitted of conspiracy and weapons charges. 1. A grand jury began investigating six Catholic dioceses after more than 50 priests or religious leaders were found to have abused children over a 40-year period in the Altoona-Johnstown Dioceses and two bishops helped cover it up. In August, the Diocese of Harrisburg acknowledged that 15 priests who had served the diocese had been accused of sexually abusing children. 2. Penn State University is still dealing with the aftermath of Jerry Sandusky's trial, nearly five years after his indictment. The university was told it would be fined nearly $2.4 million by the U.S. Department of Education in connection with the former assistant football coach's conviction for the sexual abuse of 10 minors. 3. Comedian Bill Cosby was charged with drugging and raping a woman at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. The case has been bogged down by pretrial motions for most of the year, but Cosby's trial is scheduled to begin in 2017. Hundreds of women, girls and other supporters proudly donned yoga pants in October as they peacefully paraded around the Rhode Island neighborhood of a man who derided the attire as tacky and ridiculous in a letter to the editor published in the Barrington Times. "They do nothing to compliment a women over 20 years old," Alan Sorrentino wrote. "In fact, the look is bad. Do yourself a favor, grow up and stop wearing them in public." The letter backfired. Women from as far as Texas and Australia said they'd wear yoga pants in a show of solidarity. Parade organizer Jamie Burke said women are "fed up with the policing of our wardrobes and our bodies." Dylann Roof, a self-admitted white supremacist, was convicted in December of the deaths of nine African-American parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. After six days of testimony, a federal jury took less than two hours to find him guilty of all 33 counts lodged against him. Felicia Sanders, a survivor of the attack in June 2015, called the verdict "music to my ears."  Roof, 22, will represent himself at sentencing, a move that strips his defense team of its decision-making powers. In January, the panel will deliberate on whether Roof faces a life sentence or the death penalty. People in South Dakota who refuse to cooperate with police for a urine sample may be forced to endure involuntary use of catheters. Though the practice isn't new, it has been criticized as invasive and a constitutional violation. Courtney Bowie, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, said the practice raises legal concerns. A man charged with felony drug ingestion asked a judge to throw out evidence in his case. He claimed his  rights were violated because he was subjected to an involuntary catheter, after police suspected drug use. Involuntary urine samples are permitted in South Dakota with a signed court order  but have been challenged in  Indiana and Utah. Tennessee was a tinderbox. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the resort town of Gatlinburg, Tenn., reopened to the public this month after devastating wildfires caused 14 deaths and damaged about 2,500 buildings. Prosecutors charged two teens with the blazes. The Sevier County fires came near the end of a disastrous year for fires in Tennessee, where 1,427 blazes have spanned 44,027 acres. The state and larger Southeast region are experiencing severe and at times exceptional drought. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the loquacious leader of the Supreme Court's conservative bloc and a leading force in American life for three decades, was found dead at a Texas ranch in February, kicking off a fierce battle over the future of the high court. After Scalia died, Senate Republicans refused to consider President Obama's nomination of federal appeals court Judge Merrick Garland as a replacement, and the remaining justices deadlocked 4-4 in four cases. The court began hearing cases again in October but is stuck in a holding pattern until a new justice (picked by President-elect Donald Trump) can be confirmed and seated. Most Americans might not know his name, but Evan McMullin was the independent candidate for president  some said could beat Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in Utah. He didn't. McMullin's unlikely surge in the state was a closely watched story line. The former CIA officer is Mormon and had taken on more traditional GOP stances than the party's standard-bearer. Had he locked down Utah, it would have been the first time since 1968 that a non-major-party candidate won a state. Bernie Sanders, the surprisingly strong challenger for the Democratic presidential nomination, won nearly two dozen states in the primaries before endorsing Hillary Clinton.  Credit the Vermont senator's winning personality. You tell us: Is the following exchange a real one he had with USA TODAY's Susan Page or a Saturday Night Live skit? Sanders: If Elon Musk (founder of SpaceX) called me, I could go to Mars. See, you're wrong. I'm going to make Mars a progressive planet. I'll be there first, planting the flag. People don't think big enough! [Note: It's not SNL.] Animal rights group Compassion Over Killing captured  video from inside several Tyson Foods facilities in Virginia of workers stomping, kicking and suffocating breeder chickens. In one of the videos, released in August, a  worker warned the undercover investigator that "you can't let nobody see you do that" as he stepped on a chicken's head, suffocating it. "You don't know if he's working for the animal rights," he said.  Workers seen in the videos were fired, and all live-poultry workers were retrained on the company's animal welfare policies, according to Tyson. Amazon -- the company that made leaving your house to shop optional -- has made leaving your wallet at home optional, too. At least at its brick-and-mortar store in Seattle,  which has neither cashiers nor self-checkout lines. How it works: Shoppers tap their phone at a sensor by the store's entrance and are identified by a camera. As they browse, cameras, microphones and sensors capture the action. When shoppers leave, items get charged to their Amazon account. If you don't live in Seattle, sorry. There are no plans to open more locations. The water crisis in Flint, Mich., renewed focus on the nation's water quality. West Virginia's orphaned water systems perhaps best illustrate areas for improvement in water testing and cleanliness. A USA TODAY Network investigation found that more than a dozen of the state's utilities didn't have owners or operators. Enforcement efforts for those utilities amounted to little more than a continuous stream of warning letters as utilities failed to test year after year. All the while, residents continued drinking untested -- and potentially contaminated -- water. In Coal Mountain, W.Va., residents boil their water and bleach their own supply. D.C. isn't a state, but one could argue the District's story is the most important of the year. Donald Trump, sweeping to victory as the 45th president of the United States in a bitterly fought campaign that defied the polls, pledged to "be a president for all Americans." A sharply divided nation can't agree on whether a Trump White House will save  or destroy us, but it can agree on this: The federal government is wasteful and is led by officials who would say and do almost anything to get elected before abandoning their constituents for powerful special interests. Whoa. Jerika Bolen's final months on Earth, and her heartbreaking decision to leave it, made the nation fall in love with the 14-year-old girl from Appleton. Bolen was thrust into the public eye when she announced she'd give up her fight with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 2, a painful and incurable disease. Bolen's story inspired people nationwide  to help grant her dying wish by hosting a prom in her honor. Her decision wasn't without controversy. It reanimated a debate over right-to-die issues. Disability rights groups asked authorities to investigate Jerika's care, and those with her condition urged her to change her mind. But Bolen followed through on her decision and died at a Wisconsin hospice in September. Wyoming's treasured Yellowstone National Park, which surpassed 4 million visits last year, saw tragic deaths in 2016. In June, a 23-year-old Oregon man plunged into a boiling, acidic spring. Yellowstone officials said Colin Nathaniel Scott was trying to test the water so he and his sister could "hot pot," the act of soaking in the park's thermal pools. In August, a park concession worker fell off a cliff overlooking the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River. Park officials said  Estefania Liset Mosquera Alcivar, 21, of Ecuador, was chatting with a friend when she went over the canyon's edge.

March 28, 2016	USA TODAY	One of the biggest complaints fueling 2016 voter rage is the idea that the USA has hemorrhaged jobs to China and Mexico while politicians ignored workers' pain. Some presidential candidates have plans to fix that, none bolder or more specific than Donald Trump, who says that when he's president, he'll bring jobs back.  "I'm going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China," Trump said  this month. "How does it help us when they make it in China?" For starters, a president can't order a private company to move manufacturing home. Trump talks about slapping tariffs of 35% to 45% on imports to force companies to build things here, but he'd have to get Congress to agree. Some jobs might eventually come home, but not before other countries retaliated. In the meantime, consumers would pay. Trump isn't the first to wonder why Apple can't make its iconic cellphones here. During a 2011 dinner with Silicon Valley executives, President Obama asked then-Apple chief Steve Jobs what it would take to bring those jobs home. According to The New York Times, Jobs' reply was blunt: "Those jobs aren't coming back." Why not? Lower wages are only part of the answer.  Estimates of the added cost of building the iPhone in the USA are as little as $50  -- not much extra for a $700 iPhone. But the numerous parts that make up an iPhone are principally made abroad, mostly in Asia. And China has developed a skilled, flexible workforce that would be difficult to replicate. Regardless, the vast majority of the value of an iPhone starts and stays in the USA, where the phone is designed and marketed. Key parts are U.S.-made, including the crucial A9 chip (Texas) and the scratchproof glass (Kentucky). Such logic is cold comfort to someone losing a job, such as the 2,100 workers in Indiana whose work will disappear  as Carrier moves its furnace manufacturing to Mexico in the coming years. Often, defending free trade is hard because Carrier workers are visible, but beneficiaries are diffuse. Not in Indiana. The state has 100,000 manufacturing jobs in foreign-owned businesses, including more than 2,000 at a Honda plant built in 2006. Last week, while Trump was decrying American weakness, Honda invested $52 million in American strength with plans to hire an additional 100 workers. Since 2014, Japanese auto firms, including Toyota and Subaru, announced as many new jobs in Indiana as Carrier plans to send to Mexico. Trump might have missed it, but starting in 2013, Honda's factories in Indiana, Ohio, Alabama and Georgia churned out more cars for export than Honda imported. That's a dynamic reflected nationwide, where foreign-owned businesses spend far more in the USA every year to create manufacturing jobs than leaves the country to create factory jobs outside U.S. borders. United States manufacturers and workers are not the trade loser Trump imagines. That's no thanks to Donald Trump: A tweet with a photo of a Trump brand suit recently went viral. The label inside says, "Made in Mexico." 
June 29, 2016	USA TODAY	While attacking Hillary Clinton and other career politicians, Donald Trump took aim Tuesday at two other prominent election targets: globalization and free trade. "Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very, very wealthy ... but it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache," Trump said during a speech targeting free trade in a nearly shuttered former steel town in Pennsylvania.  In a speech devoted to what he called "How to Make America Wealthy Again," Trump offered a series of familiar plans designed to deal with what he called "failed trade policies" -- including rejection of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with Pacific Rim nations and renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico, withdrawing from it if necessary. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee also said he would pursue bilateral trade agreements rather than multinational deals. Trump's plans also would target one specific economic competitor: China. He vowed to label China a currency manipulator, bring it before the World Trade Organization and consider slapping tariffs on Chinese imports coming into the U.S. Clinton and other politicians, meanwhile, "watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were plunged into depression-level unemployment," Trump said in a dusty old aluminum plant in Monessen, part of what was once known as "The Steel Valley" along the Monongahela River. Echoing his mantra of "America First," Trump vowed to use only American steel -- and aluminum -- on U.S. road, bridge, and construction projects, employing only American workers. Trump attacked Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, for past support of trade deals, including TPP. Hillary Clinton says she now opposes the Pacific Rim trade agreement and other "bad trade deals" that are hurting U.S. workers. Pledging to appoint a "trade prosecutor" during a speech in Ohio this week, Clinton vowed to go after "unfair trade practices like when China dumps cheap steel in our markets." A prominent Clinton supporter -- Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio -- called Trump a hypocrite, saying he has benefited from trade deals that have helped him sponsor clothing lines made in other countries.  Brown said Trump has "high-priced accountants" who are "cashing checks from products that he's had manufactured in other countries." During his speech in a warehouse stacked with  aluminum parts, Trump said Clinton came out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership only "when she saw my stance," and predicted that she would still sign the trade pact if elected to office. "Her whole career, she has betrayed the American worker," he said. Analysts said that Trump tends to ignore the benefits of a globalized economy, including easier and increased movement of goods and services across borders that leads to greater selection and cheaper prices for consumers.
January 18, 2017	USA TODAY	Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a forceful argument Tuesday for globalization and pushed back against talk of protectionism that was a hallmark of President-elect Donald Trump's economic policy during his campaign.  "No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war," he said at the World Economic Forum before a crowd of 1,250 global leaders and CEOs. "Some people blame economic globalization for what has gone wrong in our world," Xi said. "It is true that economic globalization has created new problems, but this is no justification to write off economic globalization all together." Xi's attendance at the annual gathering for business leaders and the international elite comes as China has sought to present itself as a force for stability after Trump's election and the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union. Both of those events were perceived as victories for anti-establishment forces. Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on some foreign-made goods and sanction China for manipulating its currency. Xi, the first Chinese head of state to visit the forum, did not mention Trump by name, but he addressed many of the trade and economic issues Trump raised during his  campaign. "Say no to protectionism," Xi said. "It is like locking yourself in a dark room. Wind and rain are kept out, but so are light and air." Xi said China would keep its door "wide open" to free trade and would not start a trade war by devaluing its currency. China contributed 39% to world economic growth in 2016, an increase of 14.2 percentage points from 2015, according to the International Monetary Fund. The speech was loaded with Chinese proverbs, American expressions and mixed metaphors. In committing to sustainable development, Xi said, "We know only too well that there is no such thing as a free lunch in the world and that no pie will fall from the sky." Xi also invoked the words of President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, which he had seen with President Obama during a state visit to the U.S. in 2015. "No country should view its development path on its own," Xi said. "Development is of the people, by the people and for the people." Anthony Scaramucci, a Trump transition aide and the only member of Trump's team to attend the forum, said the administration wants to work with China. "We want to have a phenomenal relationship with the Chinese, but if they really believe in globalization and the words of Lincoln, then we need to find a way to get more symmetry in trade deals," he said. IHS Markit chief economist Nariman Behravesh said Xi's remarks on opening up China to more imports and direct foreign investment were encouraging but should be viewed with caution. "Actions speak louder than words. A lot will depend on what China does," Behravesh said. "This is a good set of commitments on his part. It is encouraging, but we will see what the follow through is." 
May 18, 2016	USA TODAY	Whether it is bargaining with China over trade, forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall or getting along with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump asserts that he can "win" based on his negotiating skills. He lays out a series of bargaining strategies -- "Trump Cards" -- in Chapter 2 of his 1987 book with Tony Schwartz, Trump: The Art of the Deal, and says they have made him a success in real estate and other business dealings. But how applicable are they to the world of international politics and diplomacy? Many of Trump's principles are standard negotiation practice taught in university classes and business seminars. Missing, however, are the more subtle arguments that a president needs to understand to operate on the global stage:  Think big. Going for a home run (Trump's analogy) can pay off. It can also lead to a strikeout. When a pitcher (your opponent) has your number, you are better off going for the single (reining in your ambitions). Trump's fatally flawed quick fixes for large problems are instructive. They include  plans to solve the national debt by negotiating better terms with creditors (in essence claiming banktruptcy),  the immigration problem by deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants, and  terrorism by keeping Muslims out of the country. Be focused or single-minded. Keeping your eyes on the prize is good. The problem is that Trump does not distinguish between the prize and the process. Unwavering dedication to negotiating positions, such as insisting that Mexico pay for a border wall, is a recipe for impasse. Protect the downside and maximize options. Though fallback positions and expanded options can prevent caving in for bad deals, they can also steer the process away from good compromises. Trump's lack of dependence on other nations and international organizations enables him to criticize what he views as "bad" deals. The problem is that he risks alienating these critical allies, who would view him as a loose cannon. Use your leverage. Negotiating power is an asset, but it can also embolden weaker parties. Long ago, Thomas Schelling introduced us to the "paradox of weakness." Reacting to the power asymmetry, weak parties can increase their leverage by reducing their dependence on stronger opponents, developing alternative alliances and reframing the issues. Mexico might be tempted to do this, given Trump's rhetoric on trade and immigration. Reframe. Good idea, especially when stuck in an impasse. The problem is that Trump's take on the term is manipulative. For example, he writes that "a little hyperbole never hurts," and reframes the phrase "truthful hyperbole" as an "innocent form of exaggeration." That is not useful. Get the word out.  In his  campaign, Trump shows that even negative publicity generates support. But is this good advice for diplomats? The most ambitious  global agreements -- the recent Cuba talks, the 1990s Oslo Accords that produced a breakthrough in Israeli-Palestinian relations, practically all the successful peace and arms control deals -- were negotiated privately. Fight back. For Trump, who keeps track of who is "nice" or "mean" to him, fighting back is usually on behalf of himself. Imagine negotiators fighting back at each other. They'd be on a collision course where neither gains anything and the focus is misdirected to personal rather than substantive concerns. Deliver the goods. Trump sees himself as a man of action and is not overly concerned about the impact of his policies. Many of his ideas could create new problems, such as a trade war with China, even as he was flaunting his image as a doer. Rely on your instincts. Now this is bad advice, not because intuition is always misleading but because it defies the odds. The chances for negotiation success are improved when analysis is used to support intuition. Trump mentions that he learns from his own "random" surveys. It is not clear that he understands the meaning of random sampling, and he appears to reject empirical evidence based on data. Trump perceives  that life is a game to be won while having fun keeping score. Effective presidents understand that conflicts are problems to be solved. They know the value of fostering  relationships with adversaries. Patience, perspective and empathy are essential skills in a complex world. These realizations seem to elude Trump as he moves closer to securing the Republican Party's nomination in Cleveland. Daniel Druckman, a professor of international affairs at George Mason University, has trained negotiators and diplomats at the State Department and the United Nations. Paul F. Diehl, associate provost and professor of political science at the University of Texas-Dallas, is a former president of the International Studies Association. 
December 20, 2016	USA TODAY	A: With a population of nearly 1.4 billion, China is the world's largest country. It has taken advantage of its bountiful labor force to fuel an export-oriented economy. In short, it became richer by transforming itself into the world's factory. American companies fully exploited the opportunities, rushing to outsource manufacturing there. The result was a burgeoning middle class in China that formed a new export market for American products. More Chinese students can now afford to study in the U.S., often forming the largest international student group at prestigious universities. Chinese tourists pack American hotels in major cities. And the Chinese government began investing heavily in U.S. Treasuries. China is now America's largest debtor. A: A trade deficit occurs when a country's imports of goods and services exceed its exports, or goods and services shipped abroad. The U.S. trade deficit across the globe totaled $531.5 billion in 2015, up from $508.3 billion a year earlier. In other words, Americans consume more foreign goods and services than the country ships overseas. The vast majority of the U.S. deficit derives from trade with China. The gap with China rose to $365.7 billion in 2015 from $343.1 billion a year earlier. That's because more U.S. companies continue to outsource to China to take advantage of cheap labor, and those goods are then shipped to the U.S. Meanwhile, U.S. exports to China are growing as wages in that country increase and residents consume more, but not nearly as quickly as imports. The standard of living in China is still relatively low. Also, China puts high tariffs on many American products while U.S. tariffs on Chinese products are low. And the dollar is strong, particularly in relation to the Chinese yuan. That makes U.S. goods more expensive for Chinese customers, and Chinese goods cheaper for Americans. A: Some of the goods exported by the U.S. include industrial supplies, foods, airplanes, and car parts and machinery. Goods imported to the U.S. from China include consumer electronics and clothing. A: Politics plays a huge role.  Trump  knew that the message of bringing jobs back from China would resonate with voters in Rust Belt states.  "There's certainly a sense in heartland America that trade has not worked well for average workers, especially in the manufacturing sector," says Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University. "It's a lot easier to blame the external boogeyman as the main culprit for the job losses." A: As seen in his recent negotiations with Carrier to keep operations in the U.S., Trump has shown that the appearance of victory matters to him. So he's looking for concessions, says Mauro Guillen, an economics professor at the University of Pennsylvania. "What he wants is to score some kind of victory, at least symbolic," he says. He may also have more substantive goals in mind, says Matthew Kahn, an economics professor at the University of Southern California. Trump could negotiate to broaden local market access for American companies, restrict its theft of U.S. intellectual property and continue Chinese investment in U.S. real estate and universities. "I think he wants China to consume more of our exports," Kahn says. "He wants more American success there." Q: China has been accused of currency manipulation. Does this continue? How does it affect our trade policy and American companies' operations? A: China pegs the yuan to the dollar, giving the government much control over its value. Most advanced economies let  currencies "float," allowing market forces to dictate their currency value. For years, China has deliberately devalued its currency, which made its exports cheaper. But the practice has faded in the past two years, Prasad says. With the Chinese economy cooling, market forces have driven the yuan to an eight-year low against the dollar in November. And China's central bank and other state-owned banks have been intervening to ensure it's not depreciating too far, Prasad says. "Right now, it's doing the reverse of currency manipulating," he says. "It's helping the U.S." But there's no denying that American manufacturing jobs have been lost due to offshoring. Free trade "may come at the expense of some jobs in the U.S. But Americans have developed a taste for cheap consumer goods," Guillen says. Q: Trump has threatened to slap Chinese imports to the U.S. with 45% tariffs. Would that be effective in narrowing the trade deficit and bringing jobs back to the U.S.? A: Unlikely, economists say. Any measures to lower imports of Chinese products -- say, a tariff on a specific industry -- will likely result in a tit-for-tat response from China, resulting in higher prices for U.S. exports. Many U.S. manufacturers then will simply move operations to other countries with low costs, such as Vietnam. Raising tariffs is not a guaranteed remedy for regenerating U.S. manufacturing jobs, Prasad says. Besides imposing tariffs on American goods, China could seek to make accessing the Chinese market difficult for American companies. That could mean unforeseen licensing requirements and administrative procedures. Chinese students could be held back from attending American universities. Airbus' planes could be favored over Boeing. Intellectual property laws may not be enforced as aggressively. China "can start to restrict its market even more," Prasad says. "There's a lot they can do." Meanwhile, higher prices on Chinese imports to the U.S. will affect working-class Americans more disproportionately, possibly leading to concerns about inflation. A: Despite Trump's tweets that were antagonistic toward China, few economists expect him to risk a full trade war. But if he followed through on some campaign promises -- such as tariffs or formally declaring China a currency manipulator -- "that'd signal an opening salvo," Prasad says. Economists say Trump may be approaching the issue as a business dealer, bluffing and stretching boundaries to extract better deals. But the United States' need for access to the Chinese market isn't waning, and Trump must tread carefully in his dealings, they say. A slowing Chinese economy would mean less global demand for oil, steel, food and other commodities as well as fewer purchases of American real estate and luxury goods, and perhaps even a slowdown in China's purchase of U.S. Treasuries. A: Facing more competition from countries with low-cost labor, such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, the Chinese government has started to shift from an export-driven economy to one fueled by domestic consumption. "They don't have Medicare or Social Security," Guillen says. "China has 400 million people still living in poverty in rural areas. They're not ready to move toward a consumer-oriented economy." 
January 20, 2017	USA TODAY	When Donald Trump takes the oath of office today, he will be among the most famous Americans ever sworn in as president. As a prominent real estate developer and man about town, his life and loves have been a staple of the New York tabloids for decades. He has starred in a reality TV show and been the subject of several biographies. Since he announced his long-shot campaign for president 19 months ago, he has been a constant presence on television and Twitter. We all know Trump. That is to say, we all know of him. We know about the three wives, the five children, the six bankruptcies, the comeback, The Apprentice, the spectacular marketing of the "Trump" brand and the stunning victory in November. But the paradox is how little Americans really understand this celebrity who is becoming the 45th president of the United States and the first with no experience in government or the military.  Trump tapped into the hopes and fears of millions of Americans in achieving an electoral victory with a mandate to shake up Washington and make the Rust Belt shine again. He ran atop the GOP ticket, yet he is a Republican-come-lately. Beneath his thin skin, it remains murky what really matters to him and what he holds sacred. The unknowns about the new president are substantial, both from a personal standpoint and a policy one. He ran as a billionaire businessman who could cut great deals for America, but much about his finances remains obscure. That's because of Trump's steadfast refusal to release his tax returns, like every other major party candidate going back nine elections has done. The absence of those returns also robs the American people of understanding the full extent of potential conflicts Trump might have. At 70, Trump is the oldest person to assume the presidency, and he's clearly a high-energy individual for his age. Yet we know only basic information about his physical health and little about his mental health. He shows classic signs of narcissism. But do those traits rise to a clinical personality disorder? We don't know. Modern presidents are subject to a constant barrage of second-guessing, criticism and ridicule. It comes with the territory. Is Trump capable of turning the other cheek? Or will he become consumed with lashing back at his critics? So far -- based on his transition Twitter tiffs with everyone from Meryl Streep to Alec Baldwin to John Lewis -- the evidence isn't encouraging. We don't know whether Trump is a serial sexual aggressor. A dozen women have come forward with accusations, which Trump has vehemently denied. But the Access Hollywood tape from 2005 -- on which Trump is heard boasting about grabbing women's genitals -- lends some credence to the accusations. The relationship between Trump and Russia remains murky. America's intelligence agencies are convinced that President Vladimir Putin directed a hacking and disinformation campaign to help defeat Hillary Clinton. There are open questions about communication between Trump's campaign and the Kremlin. And while a salacious, opposition-research report suggesting Putin is blackmailing the president-elect is wholly unverifiable, nagging suspicions remain about Trump's odd reluctance to criticize the autocratic Russian leader. Trump's foreign policy views leave the nation wondering whether he's crazy like a fox -- or merely crazy. He persistently praises Putin while threatening a trade war with China. He talks one minute of engaging in a nuclear arms race, then another about reaching an agreement with Russia to reduce arsenals. His excellent pick for Defense secretary, James Mattis, accurately describes NATO as "the most successful military alliance probably in modern history, maybe ever." Trump calls it "obsolete" and threatens to undermine the European Union. Is Trump being reckless, or is there a larger strategy at work? Trump takes office with ill-defined or irreconcilable domestic policy views. For example, he wants to cut taxes, invest in infrastructure and the military, leave Social Security and Medicare alone -- and simultaneously reduce the federal budget deficit. How can you do that? You can't. America and the world have a huge stake in a successful Trump presidency. But more than any incoming president in memory, Trump is surrounded by a swirl of uncertainty about his intentions. This is why the excitement that typically surrounds a presidential inauguration is tempered with trepidation this time around. Is Trump willing or able to reach beyond his core supporters in an effort to unite a divided nation? That's another unknown, one that the new president has a prime opportunity to address at today's inauguration. 
May 6, 2016	USA TODAY	The political ascendancy of billionaire businessman Donald Trump and his anticipated clash for the White House with Hillary Clinton is fraught with risk for Wall Street, which fears a surprise presidential win for the upstart Trump due to his unpredictability. But it worries even more about the prospect of the former first lady winning by a landslide and paving the way for the Democrats to regain full control of Congress. For now, the stock market hasn't really reacted to the 2016 presidential race, despite a contentious primary season punctuated by potential policy shifts by Trump related to trade and immigration that could shake markets, such as picking a fight with China over trade or building a wall along the Mexican border or replacing current Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. Wall Street is also facing the ongoing populist challenge from Bernie Sanders, which has kept his anti-Wall Street message in the news and extended Clinton's fight for the nomination.  "In my opinion, we haven't seen the markets react at all," says Greg Valliere, chief strategist, at Horizon Investments. "The market still has a sanguine view." The reason for the market's wait-and-see approach to Election 2016 is that Wall Street thinks the most benign outcome -- one of three election scenarios -- is the most likely outcome. And that is Hillary Clinton, a well-known entity not prone to surprises, is seen winning the White House, but the Republicans retaining control of the House of Representatives despite a good chance of ceding control of the Senate back to the Democrats. "That's the kind of gridlock markets could live with," Valliere told USA TODAY. If Clinton's power is checked by Republicans, it's unlikely the planks of her platform -- which are similar to President Obama's, such as increased business regulation, boosting taxes on investments like capital gains, staying tough on banks, moving toward price controls in the drug industry -- will get passed into law. One big risk is if Trump, underestimated since Day 1 in the presidential race, actually takes the White House. "Investors believe that there is more risk associated with Trump," says Andy Laperriere, head of U.S. policy research for Cornerstone Macro in Washington, D.C. He ticks off three reasons why Trump might be bearish for stocks. The first is Trump has gone on record saying China is not playing fair in the global game of trade and, as a result, has said he will slap tariffs on Chinese imports to the United States. His more insular-looking, America-first policy could spook global investors. "Trump could start a trade war," Laperriere says. "One area  that Trump has conviction on is trade. If he were to impose a 30% or 40% tariff on Chinese goods, and put tariffs on imports from other countries like Japan and Mexico, it could have a pretty dire impact on the economy and be extremely disruptive to certain countries and sectors of the global economy." Trump's off-the-cuff remarks on economic matters also could spook markets, adds Charles Gabriel, president of Capital Alpha Partners. "I think we have brewing the beginnings of swirling risks for markets," Gabriel says, adding that Wall Street's angst will rise if either  Clinton looks like she will win by a landslide or if investors think Trump has a real shot at winning. NOTE: Projections are market-based, generated from real-money markets that trade contracts on upcoming events. Polling and online social media data are also factored.
September 28, 2016	USA TODAY	If the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton revealed anything, it is that she has passed the presidential test -- and he hasn't. It's not just that Trump hasn't studied  how to handle a  debate. He hasn't studied how to be president, in particular the commander-in-chief part of the job. That was evident in his rambling responses about "the nuclear" and "the cyber" -- yes, that's really what he calls it -- that have to be read to be believed.  Clinton attacked Trump for inviting Russian President Vladimir Putin "to hack into Americans." Trump denied that Russia broke into the Democratic National Committee computers, as most of the intelligence community has concluded. "It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?" Trump wound up with this gem: "I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable." It's unbelievable all right that Trump would copy Jimmy Carter's tactic from a 1980 debate when he cited his daughter as an authority on nuclear weapons -- a rhetorical gambit for which he was widely mocked. Trump's response when moderator Lester Holt asked him about America's "longstanding policy on first use" of nuclear weapons -- the U.S. has said it is willing to use nuclear weapons even if an enemy hasn't used them first -- was even more puzzling. "I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it," he said. "But I would certainly not do first strike." Thus Trump casually appeared to support President Obama's Utopian desire to rid the world of nuclear weapons while also endorsing a "no first use" policy, a step even Obama seems reluctant to take. Speaking of the nuclear arms race, Trump said: "China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea." After encouraging a Chinese invasion of North Korea, he suggested that Iran should have solved the  problem as part of the Iran nuclear deal: "Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea." Trump is  literally the first person ever to suggest that Iran could stop the North Korean nuclear program. That he is saying something so outlandish before one of the biggest TV audiences in history suggests that he is not only ignorant but also -- and even more worrying -- uneducable. As Trump said  in March, when asked about his foreign policy advisers: "I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things." Trump definitely has said a lot of things -- and the more he talks the more obvious he makes it that he is totally unfit to be commander in chief.
December 14, 2016	USA TODAY	Since Donald Trump scored the political upset of the century, his critics have worked through four of the five stages of grief at breakneck speed. Denial: As  state after state turned orange, media mavens and politicos wondered whether they had gone color blind. Election analysts kept reloading the vote tally from American Samoa trying to convince themselves this can't be happening!  Anger: Progressives rampaged through their progressive cities to smash the windows of their progressive neighbors. Bargaining:Celebrities shared memes insisting Hillary Clinton  won, linking to stories of the growing popular vote gap. Depression: Colleges hosted cry-ins and communal primal screams. One lost soul wrote an op-ed declaring that Trump's election made her abandon her search for a mate. But if you've read your Kubler-Ross, you know the fifth stage has been absent from the collective spleen vent: Acceptance. Instead, every day of the Trump transition brings another round of hyperventilation. His detractors were outraged by how long it took Trump to make Cabinet nominations, then a few days later switched their outrage to his actual choices. They were outraged that a tiny meeting of "alt-right" racists praised him. When Trump condemned the wannabe Nazis, the press blamed his supporters for falling for "fake news" and something called "Pizzagate." Can you believe what Trump said to Pakistan's prime minister -- or that he accepted a congratulatory call from Taiwan's president? What will the totalitarians in China think? But none of that pearl-clutching compared with the outrage over Trump's tweets about flag burning or recounts or China or Hamilton or Saturday Night Live. Let's face it: Trump is a, ahem, unique president-elect. Acceptance might come a little slower for those who have grown accustomed to an urbane, smooth-talking Democrat in the West Wing. Look, I was a lifelong Republican until Trump won the nomination. I voted third party rather than sign my name to his reactionary agenda. I'm not the combover interloper's biggest fan, to say the least. But hitting the fainting couch every time The Donald acts like he's acted all his life is a recipe for cardiac arrest. Worse still, if you panic over every misspelled tweet or unsourced transition rumor, no one will take you seriously if and when Trump really crosses the line. If Democrats learned anything from 2016, it's that they shouldn't have spent the past 50 years calling every Republican a racist, sexist or homophobe. Don't be the boy who cried wolf. It's going to be a long four years, with plenty of real decisions to get outraged about. If you keep losing your mind every time Donald Trump acts like Donald Trump, you're going to guarantee a long eight years.

December 1, 2016	USA TODAY	While announcing key members of his economic team, President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday he will separate himself from his global business interests while serving as president, though he will wait a couple of weeks before providing details. "I will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" Trump said during an early morning tweet storm. Trump has suggested that his children would run his business empire in his absence, though ethics lawyers said he must take additional steps in order to comply with conflict-of-interest laws.  "He must also exit the ownership of his businesses through using a blind trust or equivalent," said a joint statement from Norman Eisen and Richard W. Painter, who served as chief White House ethics lawyers for Presidents Obama and George W. Bush. "Otherwise," they said, "he will have a personal financial interest in his businesses that will sometimes conflict with the public interest, and constantly raise questions." During his tweet storm, Trump said he is not "mandated" to dis-invest. "I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses." They include hotels, resorts and office towers across the world, from the celebrated Turnberry golf course in Scotland to a newly opened hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. The New York real estate mogul did not provide details about how his new business arrangement might work, and whether his children might operate his holdings moving forward. He tweeted that "legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task!" Trump made the announcement the same day he named key members of his economic team, tapping hedge-fund manager and campaign aide Steven Mnuchin as secretary of the Treasury and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as secretary of Commerce. "By cutting corporate taxes, we're going to create huge economic growth, and we'll have huge personal income," he said. Mnuchin, 53, a former Goldman Sachs executive, worked this year as Trump's national campaign finance chairman. In announcing his selection, Trump described Mnuchin as "a world-class financier, banker and businessman" who "has played a key role in developing our plan to build a dynamic, booming economy that will create millions of jobs." If confirmed, the Treasury secretary nominee would shepherd economic plans that include a reduction in government regulations and stepped-up infrastructure projects. Ross, the nominee for Commerce secretary, co-authored an infrastructure plan that Trump aides are studying. In announcing the appointment of Ross, Trump said the investor known for buying and reorganizing businesses is "a champion of American manufacturing and knows how to help companies succeed. Most importantly, he is one of the greatest negotiators I have ever met, and that comes from me, the author of The Art of the Deal." Trump also said that Ross "knows that cutting taxes for working families, reducing burdensome government regulations and unleashing America's energy resources will strengthen our economy at a time when our country needs to see significant growth." Also discussing his appointment on CNBC, Ross said the Trump administration will pursue bilateral trade agreements with individual countries, as opposed to regional pacts like the now-stalled Trans-Pacific Partnership. Trump also announced the selection of a former critic to be deputy Commerce secretary: Todd Ricketts, a co-owner of the Chicago Cubs and member of a Republican political family that financed attack ads on Trump during the Republican primaries. The economy will also be front and center as Trump plans his first public appearance since the election more than three weeks ago: a trip to Indiana to celebrate Carrier's decision to keep 1,000 manufacturing jobs at its air-conditioning plant in the state rather than move them to Mexico. Carrier's decision came after negotiations with Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana, that included new tax breaks. Trump also plans to kick off a "thank you" tour of states that provided his margin of victory in the Electoral College, a series of rallies set to begin Thursday in Cincinnati. In recent weeks, congressional Democrats and government analysts have questioned how Trump could conduct the presidency without violating conflict-of-interest guidelines involving his various global businesses. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., plans to ask the Senate to pass a resolution that would require Trump to hand over control of his businesses. "The American public has a right to know that the president of the United States is acting in their best interest, and not because he or she has received some benefit ... from a foreign government like Russia or China or any other foreign entity," Cardin said. 
January 19, 2017	USA TODAY	Renaissance, or Armageddon? It depends on whether you love or loathe Donald J. Trump, our against-all-odds, precedent-shattering 45th U.S. president. Beginning with the final months of Lyndon Johnson's second term, I've covered nine American presidents. Nothing in nearly a half-century of experience prepared me for the 10th. Trump's upset defies standard political measures. Improbable. Shocking. Unprecedented -- no string of adjectives adequately conveys the Trump tsunami. American politics, simply, will never be the same again. Trump has fundamentally altered the business model of American elections. A Republican In Name Only, more or less, he was essentially a minor-party candidate who skillfully engineered a hostile takeover of the GOP, making both major parties look silly. He has broken the mold by every imaginable yardstick. Trump might be the least prepared candidate elected leader of the free world overnight. He has no governmental or military experience, a modest grasp of geopolitics, attention-span challenges and little patience for briefing books or policy papers. He leads with his chin, his gut and blizzards of tweets, sometimes fact-free and ill-advised, that drive his aides nuts.  He has offended so many voter blocs, committed so many head-snapping verbal gaffes, that in another era he would have self-immolated months ago. But for an angry electorate more frightened than hopeful, Trump, warts and all, was the antidote to more of the same gridlock. His electoral triumph cannot be denied, or minimized. Yes, Hillary Clinton was a poor campaigner, toting decades of political baggage, botching her email problem, and sounding evasive even when telling the truth. Despite her clear organizational and financial advantages and three impressive debate performances, Clinton's flaws were a lethal drag. Yet Trump often exhibited exponentially greater personal flaws, gleefully trashing women, Hispanics, African Americans, political elites, protesters at his raucous rallies -- anyone who dared criticize him, especially the hated news media. When caught peddling untruths, he doubled down. It didn't matter; he never paid a price. Why? As George W. Bush might explain it, the Washington establishment misunderestimated the disgust in the land, and Trump seized upon that national disenchantment. Trump and his handlers understood that the politics of rage and grievance would dominate this election. Americans were sick of dysfunctional government, blaming both parties. When House Republican zealots forced an exasperated House Speaker John Boehner to quit, it should have been a wake-up call for the political class. Instead, they wrote Trump off as a billionaire blowhard bully, a certifiable joke. The last laugh, of course, was Trump's. He was a wildly imperfect messenger, but the only candidate promising to shake up the system. Oftentimes there's a tendency with incoming presidential regimes to believe their triumph, whether huge or modest, confers automatic omniscience, a monopoly on wisdom. Jimmy Carter's Georgians, for instance, took enormous pride in ending what one of them described to me as "eight years of stinking, corrupt Republican rule." The Obama insurgents, similarly, reveled in vanquishing the vaunted Clinton machine and its personal excesses. I detect more than a whiff of that same hubris from the new president -- and especially his we-won, get-over-it handlers. It's understandable, but dangerous. Especially for a president elected with 46.1% of the vote. His electoral triumph, though remarkable, was hardly a mandate. Trump lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, and a few million of his "voters" have little use for him; they held their noses because they loathed Clinton more. These voters aren't likely to migrate easily to his agenda. Trump's temperament also remains an open question. Even some Republicans involved in his transition worry he lacks presidential deportment and personal discipline. Since the election, he has dialed back the bombast some, and his dialogues with critics such as Mitt Romney, Bob Gates and Silicon Valley executives are hopeful signs. Nevertheless, calling out an Indiana union leader, picking an embarrassing public fight with the entire U.S. intelligence community over Russia's meddling in the election, overturning four decades of bipartisan China policy before taking office and tweeting incendiary, sometimes half-baked pronouncements are troublesome. During the campaign, Trump's halting grasp of policy detail suggested he often didn't know what he didn't know. Now he does -- beginning with his private chats with President Obama, classified foreign-policy briefings and skull sessions with GOP elders and private citizens with serious expertise. Notwithstanding his robust self-confidence, the policy challenges facing Trump are daunting, and he recognizes it. His relative inexperience requires a steep, swift learning curve -- and a superlative Cabinet and personal staff. In assembling a government, presidents must strike a balance between loyalty and competence. Each brings along his share of hacks, toadies, cronies and minor leaguers. The trick is finding harmless slots for the worst and supplementing the most able loyalists with savvy outsiders. President Reagan, for example, named longtime California ally Edwin Meese his presidential counselor. But he also installed James Baker, close friend and political confidant to George H.W. Bush, as White House chief of staff. The Californians were livid, but Meese's institutional memory and personal links to Reagan, combined with Baker's organizational prowess and ideological pragmatism, served the new president well. To put it bluntly, each new president must surround himself with the best and the brightest, not the cream of the crap. Trump has some of both. Rex Tillerson at State and James Mattis at Defense are first-rate talents. Some other nominees are considerably less impressive; several are ideologues, picked for their loyalty and shock value -- to rattle and overhaul left-leaning agencies suspicious of Trump's agenda. If history is a guide, some of them, even key West Wing staffers, will wash out by year's end. On-the-job training only works for so long. Beyond implementing his conservative, back-to-the-future vision, Trump faces another formidable task -- healing a fractured, deeply divided America. Trump is the third divisive president in a row. To succeed, he must reverse that trend promptly. Despite vows to be the president of all and vague pledges to bind up the wounds of a raw election, his thank-you trips to states he won, reprising his raucous campaign rallies, aren't exactly reassuring. Like any new president, the 45th deserves every chance to succeed. His presidency is already historic; it's uncertain whether it will lift our spirits or stoke our fears. Anyone who pretends to know is a fool, hack or partisan. Overnight is a lifetime in politics. Trump has at least 1,461 lifetimes ahead to make his case to a polarized country so desperate for change, it chose the host of The Apprentice to lead it.

March 31, 2016	USA TODAY	Chinese President Xi Jinping recently toured the headquarters of three state-run media organizations, telling journalists to be loyal to the Communist Party in "thought, politics and action."  As if to underscore how seriously journalists took his admonition, coverage turned comically positive. Chinese national television CCTV reported that Xi liked a news app he was shown: "Quite literally, he hit 'like,'" an enthusiastic anchor said. CCTV also noted that a staffer for the Xinhua news agency said Xi's "encouragement was their driving force." The visit might have been a big hit with the regime, but it came as a big disappointment to anyone who thought that China's decades-long economic expansion and growing middle class would lead to greater freedom. The Chinese government is in the midst of a news media crackdown. In addition to issuing loyalty edicts, it has arrested journalists for covering Beijing protests and last summer's stock market crash. Lest people try to bypass official news media, the government continues to strengthen the Great Firewall of China that prevents free access to information on the Internet. China's domestic moves make its recent aggressive military posture all the more foreboding. Rather than leveraging its growing prestige to become a trusted international leader, China has spent the past few years building its military and making dubious claims to islands in the South China Sea and elsewhere. It has created artificial islands  with weapons, inviting conflict with neighbors and America, despite assurances China would not. Xi and Obama plan to meet Thursday at a nuclear security meeting in Washington. Responsible nations don't act like this. Whatever natural resources or military advantages could be gained through these islands are less valuable than the good faith China is squandering with its neighbors. The Chinese government has not been without redeeming qualities. It agreed to steep cuts in carbon emissions and recently OK'd sanctions on North Korea that it had long resisted. China-bashing of the kind espoused by presidential candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders is not constructive. Notwithstanding its recent behavior, China is not a new Cold War adversary. Even so, the U.S. and its allies need to step up pressure. The best place to start would be to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade pact that excludes China. The TPP gets a bum rap from both parties, while former trade stalwart and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has abandoned it. But the TPP is vital to reassure Pacific allies and counter China's economic strength. The U.S. needs to forge stronger Asian military ties and make clear that China's aggression abroad and repression at home are not in its best interests. China is not behaving the way Western nations envisioned when they welcomed it into a series of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements. It's too soon to give up. But Obama and U.S. allies need to forcefully push back against China's troubling direction under Xi. If not, the silliness of Chinese reporting will be the least of America's problems. 
December 15, 2016	USA TODAY	Ringed by tech's elite, President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday promised to do "anything we can do" to help the industry he often baited during the presidential campaign. "This is truly an amazing group of people," Trump said at Trump Tower to kick off a meeting with Silicon Valley's top leaders. "I want to add that I'm here to help you folks do well." A dozen tech A-listers -- Apple CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, among them -- sat down for the two-hour meeting with the president-elect to discuss jobs, immigration policy, China, cybersecurity and taxes.  Trump told the group his administration is "going to be here for you. You'll call my people, you'll call me. We have no formal chain of command around here." He suggested, and tech leaders agreed to, meeting quarterly, according to a person briefed on the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. They discussed repatriating foreign profits, reforming taxes and regulations so companies build more jobs in the U.S., building better infrastructure and improving education, the person briefed on the meeting said. Government procurement and protecting intellectual-property rights, major topics for several tech companies in attendance, also came up, according to the Trump transition team. Cook and Musk were scheduled to meet privately with Trump later. Notably absent, however, was Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who invented what possibly is Trump's favorite app. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg did not attend, but Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg did. Trump wants the tech industry "to keep going with the incredible innovation," he said on live television. "There's nobody like you in the world. There's nobody like the people in this room." Trump was flanked by Vice President-elect Mike Pence and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, one of his few vocal supporters in Silicon Valley. Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft declined comment. Bezos, however, struck a conciliatory tone. "I shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech --  everywhere," he said in a statement. The meeting, roughly one month before the billionaire real-estate tycoon is sworn in as the 45th president, could offer an early litmus test on how Trump plans to bring jobs  to the Rust Belt and other non-tech regions. The attendees represent more than 1.3 million U.S. jobs and a total market cap of $2.9 trillion, according to the Consumer Technology Association. Last year, the consumer tech sector generated $3.5 trillion in economic output and accounted for more than 15 million people, or 8.4% of total U.S. employment, CTA says. One area where Trump and tech agree: reforming the tax code. Trump says he plans to slash the corporate tax rate to 15% from 35%, which could prompt tech giants to repatriate money kept overseas. There could also be common ground over Trump's anti-regulatory policies, which might aid start-ups. In his year-long sprint to the presidency, Trump has traded barbs with the industry. While President Obama frequently visited Silicon Valley and hosted tech executives at the White House, Trump engaged in tweet-bashing Apple and Amazon, disparaging their off-shoring of jobs, stances on encryption and tax contributions. Dozens of executives, meanwhile, signed an open letter opposing his candidacy. Nearly all represented large, traditional companies with the exception of Palantir Technologies, the private software and services company co-founded by  Thiel. Thiel, Kushner and Priebus organized the gathering of tech executives Wednesday. Earlier Wednesday, Musk and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick were added to Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, which had been noticeably absent of tech leaders. "Trump is our president for the next four years, so the tech community needs to set aside its intellectual arrogance and move forward with him to maintain its pre-eminence as an industry," says Vineet Jain, CEO of start-up Egnyte, an enterprise file-sharing and collaboration provider. "He's a businessman; I don't think he will do anything to jeopardize (the tech industry)." Baig reported from New York; Swartz and Guynn from San Francisco.

August 8, 2016	USA TODAY	Donald Trump is hoping this  week acts as a catalyst to turn around what has been a tough week for the Republican presidential nominee. On Monday, Trump is expected to unveil his economic plan, which he says will create millions of  jobs. I caught up with one of his economic advisers -- Stephen Moore, distinguished visiting fellow at the Institute for Economic Freedom and Opportunity, with The Heritage Foundation -- to find out what is in the works. Our interview follows, edited for clarity and length. A: The heart of the plan is a 15% corporate tax rate.  That's down from the current rate of 35%. We will almost overnight go from being one of the highest corporate tax countries in the world to one of the lowest.  That would bring a lot of jobs and businesses back to the United States. And then there will be a middle-class tax cut. Every time we've met with him, Trump has said, "I want it oriented toward the individual, helping middle-class and financially stressed-out families." We're running the numbers now, and the average middle-class family will save somewhere in the neighborhood of $1,500-$2,000 a year on their federal income taxes. It eliminates the estate tax. It eliminates the marriage penalty. It eliminates the alternative minimum tax. Also, it's simpler. About 90% of Americans would  no longer have to itemize deductions. You wouldn't have to keep track of all your receipts on purchases, on charitable deductions, etc., because most people would just take the generous standard deduction. Q: So the question keeps coming up: "How do you pay for it? How do you cut taxes and not drive up the deficit?" A: First of all, it's surprising how little the corporate tax raises. It's not a huge revenue generator for the U.S. government because a lot of companies don't pay anything because of all the loopholes in the system. It's very counterproductive in terms of where companies locate. That's the very essence of a bad tax system, one that's complicated and, with high rates,  doesn't raise much money. We will close loopholes on the corporate side. So stuff like investing and green-energy deductions will go away. The plan will find a way to shift the way the corporate tax is implemented  so that it would apply more to imports. When countries like China, India or Mexico send products into the United States, we want to tax those then. When American companies export our goods and services, we want to  reduce the tax on them. What we do now is we tax what we export, but we don't tax what's imported. When China sends $500billion worth of goods and services to the United States, there will be a tax applied.  This is not a violation of trade agreements. In fact, this is the way most other countries tax their business side, so we're going to switch to a border adjustable tax system that will help our exports and reduce the trade deficit. A: I'm a member of this group called the Trump Leadership Council. It's a group that includes CEOs from Fortune 100 companies who run energy, transportation and/or financial services companies. We've been listening to these people talk about what their constraints are, in terms of growing their companies. So many of these CEOs say the problem is not  the tax burden. The biggest problem is this regulatory stranglehold. And so we're looking at what kinds of executive orders and regulations could be almost immediately repealed by Trump.  Reagan did this when he entered office. The first act he put in place was he deregulated the price of oil and gas with a stroke of the pen, in his first hour of the White House. Those are the kinds of things that Trump is saying he wants to do. Q: Some people estimate the Trump tax plan alone would cost $10 trillion. What about the debt and deficits? Won't all of this break the bank? A: On the business side, most of the payoff is through closing loopholes. We do think it'll generate more economic growth. It's trickier on the individual side, because the vast majority of revenues that the government raises is not through the business tax, but through the individual income tax system. So we're talking about some kind of a cap on deductions that people can take, especially wealthy people. This is not well known, but there are dozens of loopholes and carve-outs in the tax system. Most of the benefits of those go to the highest-income people. Anyone who makes over $1 million will have most of their deductions phased out. They're gonna pay a lower tax rate, but they're gonna lose a lot of deductions. Hillary Clinton is running around the country saying it's a $10 trillion revenue loss, but that's not true. We've probably reduced the revenue loss to about one-third of that. We are also considering a sort of repatriation tax where companies are charged a small tax to bring the $2trillion overseas back home. American companies like Microsoft, Apple, so many others have cash abroad. They'll be able to bring that money back for a tax of somewhere between 5%-10%. that'll bring a lot of that capital back to the U.S., and we'll actually raise revenue. Q: Let me go back to trade. If we renew all of these trade deals that he's talking about, is that going to be more of a disruption and bring higher-priced goods here as opposed to a better trade deal for America? A: I am a free trader. And I've said I don't agree with Donald Trump on some of the positions he takes on trade. He wants to renegotiate (the Trans-Pacific Partnership) and he wants to renegotiate NAFTA. TPP isn't really even in existence yet, so that wouldn't be so disruptive. I think the idea is to start over. If you have a new president, you start over the negotiations. On NAFTA, we will see. I'm not so sure, because I think NAFTA's been a positive thing for the economy of North America. Q: Donald Trump has had a hard time keeping on message. Do you think he can win this in the next 100 days? A: I can't tell you how frustrated all of us are with the fact that the focus isn't completely on the economy. Because, just a week ago, we got these abysmal numbers on the economy. And then, a week or two before that, we got abysmal numbers on the job front. He should be holding up the front page of the newspaper from just last Saturday. It said the "Worst recovery since the Great Depression ... " A: If he can focus almost exclusively on the economy for the next three months, the answer to your question is yes, he can win this race. If you look over the 50, 60, 70 years, presidents and parties in power don't get re-elected when you have 1% economic growth. Trump has to say, "Hillary, you own this foreign policy and you own this economy and you are the agent of the status quo. And I'm the agent for change." 
August 10, 2016	USA TODAY	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Monday laid out his economic plan -- a grab bag of tax breaks for households and corporations, fewer regulatory speed bumps for businesses and a bare-knuckled approach to trade policy. Here's a look at how feasible his proposals are and what the impact would be: Cut personal income taxes. Trump wants to consolidate the seven tax brackets to three and reduce the top rate from 39.6% to 33%. He would likely struggle to get such large tax breaks through even a Republican Congress, which has been bent on slashing the deficit, without some compromise, economist Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics says. If the plan were to pass, the vast majority of the cuts would go to the wealthy, says Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.  Slash corporate taxes. The corporate tax rate would plummet from 35% to 15%, instantly making the U.S. a more desirable location for multinational companies. Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says the move would make the U.S. more competitive as it shifts from being the world's highest-taxing country to among the lowest. But Trump may be going too far. Hufbauer says even a 20% tax rate would put the U.S. in that highly competitive group. And Zandi says the proposal's major flaw is that Trump has not specified how he would pay for it. Cut taxes for small businesses. Many small businesses now pay their personal tax rate for so-called pass-through business income. Trump wants to slash that rate to 15% as well. But more than two-thirds of pass-through income goes to the top 1% of tax filers, Marr says, providing another windfall to the wealthy. And, he says, many would game the system, finding ways to file  as small businesses to take advantage of the lower rate. Scrap the carried interest loophole. This rule allows investment fund partners to treat their income as capital gains, taxing the money at significantly lower rates. Getting rid of a loophole that many experts regard as unfair would appear to create a new income stream. But Marr says many fund partners would simply try to have the money taxed at the even lower pass-through rate for small businesses. Cut regulations. Trump says he would place a moratorium on all new agency regulations and eliminate other rules, including for energy companies. While the proposal could be a boon for  investment, Zandi says it can't be judged because Trump has not specified which regulations would be abolished, making it impossible to assess the costs against the benefits. Kill the Trans-Pacific Partnership and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. It would be simple for Trump to back out of the TPP, as it has not been ratified by Congress, Hufbauer says. But he says it would hurt more than help the U.S., which has fewer trade barriers than other participating countries. And it would hand China more control over world trade. The U.S. could seek to renegotiate NAFTA, but it's unclear what Trump wants from Mexico and Canada. There are currently no tariffs on goods traded in North America. The U.S. also could withdraw from the pact by giving six months notice, Hufbauer says. Get tough with China on trade. Trump says he wants to label China a currency manipulator, prevent it from stealing U.S. intellectual property and stop the government from subsidizing exports. If it refuses, Trump has said he would threaten to impose 45% tariffs on Chinese imports.  A better tactic, Hufbauer says, is more traditional diplomacy. Repeal the Affordable Care Act. It would be possible if Trump could get a Republican Congress to go along. That would be unlikely unless lawmakers have a replacement plan that addresses Americans who've gained coverage under the law, says Brian Blase, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. 
December 5, 2016	USA TODAY	Donald Trump and aides braced for a busy week Sunday by threatening tariffs on companies that move jobs overseas, while downplaying China's protest of an unprecedented phone call between the American president-elect and the leader of Taiwan. Just days after praising a deal providing tax breaks to a company for keeping jobs in the U.S., Trump renewed his threat to slap tariffs on the products of companies that outsource in the future.  "There will be a tax ... soon" of 35% for companies that go overseas and try to sell goods "back across the border," Trump said during a Sunday tweet storm. Trump aides, meanwhile, described the president-elect's call on Friday with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen as congratulatory in nature and said it does not signal a change in the "one China" policy toward the government in Beijing, at least not right now. "I think I would just say to our counterparts in China that this was a moment of courtesy," Vice President-elect Mike Pence told NBC's Meet the Press, noting that Trump had a similar congratulatory call with China President Xi Jinping, and "that was not a discussion about policy." Pence also told NBC that Trump is preparing to take office on Jan. 20, and "we'll deal with policy at that time." In putting together an administration, Trump is planning more appointments and post-election rallies in the days ahead. The president-elect said last week that, on Monday, he would nominate James Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, for secretary of Defense. Trump is also weighing a number of candidates for secretary of State. During his Sunday series of tweets, Trump said no company should leave the United States because he plans to cut taxes and regulations, and those that do move jobs overseas will face consequences. "Any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. without retribution or consequence, is WRONG!" he said. The tweets came days after Trump and aides celebrated a deal with the Carrier heat and air conditioning company, which abandoned plans to move some jobs to Mexico after the state of Indiana provided $7 million in tax incentives. Even some Trump supporters, such as former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, bashed the Carrier deal as "crony capitalism." Now, critics are taking aim at Trump's revival of a threat he made during the presidential campaign, saying his claim to tax products made by U.S. companies overseas will lead to higher prices for American consumers. "Pres-Elect Trump means well," tweeted Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb. "But won't his 35% tariff idea raise prices on American families? How would it not be a new 35% tax on families?" Chris Edwards, director of tax policy at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, says introducing the 35% tariff "would have all kinds of negative and damaging repercussions." For consumers, it could mean paying more for goods, he said. It could also affect U.S. multinational businesses who seek to broaden their reach globally by exporting goods into other countries. "When, for example, Dupont or GE or other American firms set up facilities in Europe or Latin America or wherever, the main purpose is to penetrate those markets and to expand their global sales" which boosts U.S. exports, Edwards says. Trump appeared to be provoked by news that Rexnord, the Indiana-based bearing manufacturer, is planning to move jobs to Mexico. "Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers," Trump tweeted over the weekend. "This is happening all over our country. No more!" No U.S. president has spoken officially with a leader of Taiwan since the United States recognized mainland China as the sole government of the Chinese people in 1979. Under the "one China" policy, the U.S. acknowledges the Beijing government's claim that Taiwan is part of China. Hitting the Sunday show circuit, Trump officials said the reaction to the Sunday phone call is overblown. "It was just a phone call at this point," Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said on Fox News Sunday, and "people shouldn't read too much into it." In its statement on the call, Taiwan said the two leaders "exchanged pleasantries and shared their views and principles regarding key policy matters, particularly the need to promote domestic economic development and strengthen national defense so that citizens can enjoy better lives and increased security." The Friday conversation with the Taiwanese president was the latest in a series of phone calls between Trump and foreign leaders that have raised eyebrows in the diplomatic community. In a call with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Trump offered "to play any role you want me to play to address and find solutions to the country's problems," according to a readout from Pakistan. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte said Trump endorsed his aggressive war on drugs, one in which more than 2,000 people have been killed by police in what critics describe as vigilante justice. In its protest to the U.S. government over Trump's call with the Taiwanese president, Beijing said, "There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inseparable part of the Chinese territory." The statement called the one China policy " the political foundation of China-US relations." State-run media in China took a lower-key approach, with China Daily saying there is no need to "over-interpret" the Taiwan phone call, attributing it to the New York businessman's "inexperience in dealing with foreign affairs."
December 13, 2016	USA TODAY	In a few sentences Sunday, President-elect Donald Trump upset an apple cart precariously balanced for 37 years across the Taiwan Strait. Trump said in an interview with Fox News that he did not feel "bound by a one-China policy," prompting the communist government in Beijing to voice its "serious concern" Monday that Trump could take steps to change U.S. policy toward China and the self-governing island of Taiwan.  His comments came nine days after a telephone call with the president of Taiwan that broke with U.S. policy, which bars such direct communication, and upset the Beijing leadership. The U.S. recognition of a "one-China" policy stems from 1979, when the United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the People's Republic of China (PRC). In the 1979 U.S.-P.R.C. Joint Communique, the United States recognized the communist leadership in Beijing as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging the Chinese position that there is one China and Taiwan is a breakaway province that is part of China. Officially, the U.S. government does not support independence for Taiwan, a democracy that elects its own president and parliament. U.S. relations with the island are governed by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which outlines the U.S. commitment to help Taiwan maintain its military defense. Last year, the United States approved $1.8 billion in arms sales to Taipei. Washington maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan through the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT),  which implements U.S. policy, facilitates trade and issues visas. Taiwan maintains a de facto embassy in Washington through its Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO). Trade between the USA and Taiwan is robust: The USA is Taiwan's second-largest trading partner, and Taiwan ranks as the ninth-largest trading partner for the USA. According to the State Department, companies from Taiwan employ more than 12,000 workers in the USA. For Taiwan, the lack of diplomatic recognition by the United States and most other nations means it cannot belong to international organizations, such as the United Nations.

January 9, 2017	USA TODAY	One of the most critical foreign policy challenges President-elect Donald Trump will face in the early days of his administration is what to do about the nuclear saber rattling that continues to emanate from North Korea. Ringing in 2017 with a New Year's Day address, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told the world that the year ahead would see North Korea test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), perhaps one capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. Because North Korea denies most information to the outside world, no one knows for sure whether Kim's claim is true or whether North Korea possesses the technological know-how to launch a missile on a suborbital trajectory and have it return to Earth on target. Last year, it tested its intermediate-range missile and failed seven of eight times.  Trump has signaled that he has a plan, but it remains under wraps. He did tweet that "North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen!" Whether successful or not, an ICBM test by North Korea would be very much against U.S. interests. Trump should act to counter it as early as possible. A turn to the basics of deterrence would be the path most likely to succeed. For deterrence to be effective, America should make clear to North Korea and its 33-year-old autocratic leader that an ICBM test will neither empower the Kim regime nor advance its nuclear capability. When North Korea threatened ICBM development in 2006, former Defense secretary William Perry and Ashton Carter, who now holds the job, recommended that the United States destroy any test missile on its launch pad. That plan, however, was considered too escalatory and raised fears that North Korea might respond by firing artillery at U.S. allies in the region, such as South Korea or Japan. Instead, Trump could announce a plan to use U.S. missile defenses to shoot down any test ICBM after its launch. Shooting down North Korea's test vehicle would be a spectacular demonstration of the futility of the Kim regime continuing to pursue its nuclear ambitions, and far less escalatory than dropping bombs on North Korea. At the same time, the Trump administration could threaten to undermine the Kim regime's power through new information operations if North Korea tests an ICBM. Trump also could pressure China to intervene, though Presidents Obama and George W. Bush had similar hopes and China never delivered. Trump made clear his dissatisfaction with China's failure to intervene in a recent tweet: "China has been taking out massive amounts of money and wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!" But China might be more willing to intercede if it knows that the United States is prepared to take major action against the Kim regime to stop its testing of ICBMs. Kim has parallel goals in pursuing nuclear weapons: One is to distract his people from the many economic and social failures of the Kim family regime by showing the world that North Korea is a nuclear peer of the United States. The other is to demonstrate his ability to strike the USA with nuclear weapons. He hopes to thereby coerce U.S. agreement to a peace treaty with North Korea to end the 1950s Korean War, which could lead to an eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea. Without U.S. forces in South Korea, Kim might be emboldened to pursue the only form of reunification he supports -- North Korean conquest and absorption of South Korea. Though a test is merely a test, if Kim orders enough of them during 2017, North Korea could succeed in resolving the many problems its missile program has encountered. That's why a strong U.S. response is needed now. There clearly are risks to any response that could provoke the mercurial Kim, but the risks of allowing North Korea to have a proven ICBM capable of carrying a nuclear payload are far greater. If even a single nuclear-armed North Korean ICBM were to strike a U.S. city, it could kill or seriously injure several hundred thousand Americans. Trump should be clear on how he would respond, not just to the threat of attack, but also to the tests that could make such an attack possible in the future.
July 12, 2016	USA TODAY	No one has made more bonehead statements in this presidential run than Donald Trump. Pundits sometimes attribute this to inexperience. They're wrong. Trump has been crafting his campaign since at least 1980, when Rona Barrett asked him whether he'd ever seek the nation's top job. Why would a gossip columnist pose such a question? Maybe Trump planted the idea? In 1988, he assured Oprah Winfrey that if he ever sought the presidency, he'd probably win. Then in 1999, Trump formed a presidential exploratory committee on the Reform ticket. His first primary would be in California, where he made his pitch on Jay Leno's Tonight Show.  As a producer for the show, I booked and worked directly on Trump's appearances, and I'll never forget that one. Leno introduced Trump as "the next president of the United States," and he walked out to the strains of Hail to the Chief while flashing victory signs. Leno was going for a joke. Trump was serious. The real estate mogul went on to win the Golden State Reform Party primary in 2000, but soon dropped out of the race when it became apparent he had no chance of winning the presidency. He has never liked losing. Trump would return to The Tonight Show in 2004, ostensibly to plug his new NBC show, The Apprentice. But Trump went out of his way to push his political views. And it didn't stop there. During subsequent bookings on both NBC with Leno and CBS with David Letterman, Trump hinted at his interest in a presidential bid. I thought  he was doing it as a ruse to promote The Apprentice and later Celebrity Apprentice; I chalked it up to  unconventional but effective marketing. But now that he is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, I realize I had it backward: Trump wasn't posing as a presidential candidate to boost his Nielsen ratings. He was actually making a campaign dry run under the guise of being a celebrity. I've reviewed Trump's interviews with Leno and Letterman over the years, and discovered he had regular talking points: Sound familiar? Trump has been honing his campaign shtick for more than 30 years, like a comedian testing material to come up with a killer set. And he has made clear he sees late-night shows as integral to a campaign -- for instance, comparing Mitt Romney unfavorably to President Obama in 2012 because "Obama, say what you want, he was on Jay Leno, he was on David Letterman. " Is Trump a monster, as his critics contend? I don't think so. Now, I don't claim to be an insider. But I had a 10-year relationship with Trump and my phone calls were always returned, sometimes by him. Backstage at The Tonight Show, he was always pleasant and never asked for special treatment. His wife, Melania, and his adult children were equally gracious. People who worked for him, including women, were loyal and supportive. Is he racist? In my experience, no. I've read his books, The Art of the Deal and The Art of the Comeback, and I think they reflect his business philosophy: Make outrageous demands, and then back off and negotiate a deal. Does he have flaws? Yes, he has a bad case of inflated self-esteem, which severely clouds his vision. Just before a scheduled chat with Leno in September 2005, Trump greeted me by saying, "I'm here to save your sorry network." Then he pointed out that The Apprentice was rated No. 1. Except it wasn't. The ratings had started to slip at the time. I thought he was joking, so I laughed. But he didn't, and neither did his staffers. It was obvious that they hadn't told him about his dropping Nielsen numbers. You can't be president if you only hire yes-people. Trump's biggest problem? A tendency to be small and petty. He loved gossiping about people like Rosie O'Donnell with Leno and other hosts. This is a serious character flaw. Is Trump capable of changing? I think so. He took direction from executives at The Apprentice by adding famous people and renaming it Celebrity Apprentice, averting a possible cancellation. Recently, he has used teleprompters to make major campaign speeches and toned down at least some of his bonehead remarks.
January 20, 2017	USA TODAY	The Trump administration will carry over more than 50 key Obama administration officials after Inauguration Day as  he tries to ensure continuity while putting his own team in place, the transition team said Thursday.  Among them: Adam Szubin, the acting Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence whose nomination by Obama was stalled in the Senate for 20 months. He will serve as the acting Treasury secretary until Trump nominee Steven Mnuchin is confirmed by the Senate. Trump announced his intent to nominate former Georgia governor Sonny Perdue as Agriculture secretary on Thursday, the last of 21 Cabinet-level nominations. That leaves more than 5,000 lower-level appointments to be made, including the important deputy and assistant Cabinet secretaries often charged with running the departments day to day. The incoming Trump administration emphasized Thursday that people would be in place to respond to national security threats or natural disasters. New York Jets owner Woody Johnson has been tapped to serve as President-elect Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Kingdom, a transition official confirmed Thursday. Trump himself alluded to the diplomatic post for Johnson on Thursday, referring to him as "ambassador" during remarks at a celebratory luncheon in downtown Washington. At one point, Trump said Johnson was "going to St. James," a reference to the official title held by the top U.S. diplomat in London. The transition official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the nomination has not been formally announced. Johnson, a veteran Republican fundraiser and donor, served as a top fundraiser for Trump and the Republican National Committee during the general election battle. President-elect Donald Trump attended a luncheon with several of his Cabinet picks Thursday, and it seemed he just couldn't help but gush about them. "We're going to send her over to speak to China. We're going to send her over to speak to everybody," Trump said. "I think we're going to do a lot of great things, Nikki, right? Thank you for going through this, you did a fantastic job." He lamented the Democratic gantlet of criticism run by Tom Price, whom he picked to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. "We have a lot of smart people. ... We have by far the highest IQ of any Cabinet ever," he quipped to the crowd at the Trump International Hotel in Washington.
February 25, 2016	USA TODAY	Well, you know you're gonna have to face it: There's a  strong likelihood that Donald Trump will be the Republican presidential candidate in 2016. As Trump's big win in Nevada on Tuesday night, his third in a row, sinks in, it's time -- past time -- to end the denial.  For months, the belligerent billionaire has been riding high in  ubiquitous polls and dominating the GOP contest and conversation. But there long has been a strong undercurrent in the politico/media complex narrative that he's not really going to win. It seemed unthinkable that a flamboyant reality TV star/businessman with no political experience, a penchant for the insulting and the outrageous, no apparent policy chops and absolutely no respect for the rules of the game could become one of two finalists to become Leader of the Free World. But just as Trump is a very different candidate, we're dealing with a very different electorate this time around. As Trump has made preposterous statement after preposterous statement -- rapists from Mexico, McCain's not a war hero, blood coming out of her whatever, thousands of New Jersey Muslims celebrating 9/11 -- there were confident predictions that this, at last, would blow up the juggernaut. But remarks that would have ended the campaigns of lesser mortals slowed The Donald not at all. Even ripping former Republican president George W. Bush's Iraq war with the fervor of a committed lefty was a non-event. Then there was the grudging notion that OK, maybe this bull in the china shop is resonating with a significant slice of the electorate, but that doesn't necessarily translate into votes at the polls, a view that was reinforced briefly by Trump's second-place finish in Iowa. But since then the mogul has run the table, winning handily in three very different locales -- New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada -- in both the primary and caucus format. There has been -- and still is -- talk that Trump can be stopped once the field is winnowed and the "establishment" can rally behind a single anti-Trump. This remains theoretically possible, but I wouldn't bet the craft beer money on it. Bunched closely together far behind Trump are Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who have battled each other furiously. Neither shows any sign of going away anytime soon. But what if one of them does? It's not as if Cruz supporters are going to bolt to Rubio en masse. And if it's Trump v. Cruz, for what's left of the GOP establishment, they might be checking out one-way airfares to Canada. Ohio Gov. John "I don't know if my purpose is to be president" Kasich? His small slice of the pie would barely be a speed bump for the Trump express. None of which is to say that a Trump nomination is a done deal. Politics, like life, is full of the unexpected, as Trump buddy and onetime GOP presidential front-runner Rudy Giuliani and 2008 Democratic mortal lock Hillary Clinton would be glad to tell you. But Trump has had a stranglehold on this race for quite a long time, and it only seems to be tightening. Next up  is a CNN debate at the University of Houston on Thursday night moderated by  indefatigable Wolf Blitzer. All eyes, or at least many of them, are likely to be on Cruz, who is reeling from relentless pummeling from Trump, Rubio and Carson (and lots of negative coverage) over his campaign's dirty tricks. Cruz this week ousted his communications director for tweeting a news story falsely suggesting that Rubio had dissed the Bible. It will also be interesting to see if Trump, who has made devastating use of personal attacks on his rivals (see Bush, Jeb!), begins to turn his fire on Rubio, who finished second in the last two contests. The debate will set the stage for next week's Super Tuesday, aka the SEC primary, which features GOP face-offs in a dozen states, including Cruz's home state of Texas and a cluster of Southern states. It's hard to see a way forward for Cruz if he doesn't have a good day. OK, so the impossible happens and Trump wins the nomination. No way he is making it all the way to the White House, right? Don't be so sure. While the polls are a) hardly Gospel in general, and b) of limited value long before an election matchup takes shape, they are at least a hint. And the averages at Real Clear Politics are hardly reassuring, particularly in the case of Clinton, who at this writing has a margin-of-error lead of 2.8%. And there's no question Democratic front-runner Clinton and challenger Sen. Bernie Sanders both have significant vulnerabilities. Clinton has issues of trust and likeability as well as that nagging, ongoing federal investigation of her private email system while she was secretary of State. For Sanders, there are questions about his foreign policy acumen (although Trump reminds no one of Bismarck) and the broader issue of whether Americans would elect a socialist.
February 26, 2016	USA TODAY	Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz lobbed their harshest attacks yet at Donald Trump, trying to slow the celebrity billionaire's momentum before Super Tuesday's primaries, which could vault him far ahead in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.  The two U.S. senators ganged up on Trump on a slate of topics -- immigration, health care, his family money, his personal finances, and basic fitness for the presidency -- during the CNN event in Houston. It was a change of pace for Rubio, who has generally avoided direct conflict with Trump, and it made this the most contentious debate yet. Cruz questioned whether Trump is even a Republican, citing his past support for Democratic policy positions and candidates, including Hillary Clinton. "In 2013 when I was leading the fight against the 'Gang of Eight' amnesty bill, where was Donald? He was firing Dennis Rodman on 'Celebrity Apprentice,'" Cruz said. Rubio also ridiculed Trump for claiming he's the one that introduced the topic of immigration reform to the 2016 race, blasting him as "only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally." The two remaining candidates, John Kasich and Ben Carson, fought just to get a word in. Kasich asked the moderators to take control of all the bickering. Carson at one point, begged for speaking time, noting the debate rules that candidates could respond to attacks. "Can somebody attack me, please?" Rubio referred to Trump's now-defunct Trump University as a "fake" school: "You know what they got? They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump." Cruz picked up on this attack and predicted a pending fraud trial brought by students would derail Trump's campaign later this year. On Trump's suggestion to put a high tariff on Chinese exports to the United States, Rubio mocked the businessman: "You are going to be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits." Trump's case against Rubio and Cruz was that they're both inept politicians, who either melt down under pressure or mislead voters. "You are all talk and no action. This guy's a choke artist," he said, referring to Rubio, "and this guy's a liar" referring to Cruz. The attacks were an effort to dent the commanding position Trump is in after his easy wins in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. The latest delegate count: Trump 82, Cruz 17, Rubio 16, John Kasich 6 and Ben Carson 4. Next week on Super Tuesday, 595 delegates are up for grabs -- about half of the 1,237 necessary to win the GOP nomination. CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Trump whether he would release his tax returns as 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney has demanded. Trump said he is routinely audited and "I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously." Cruz said that underscores the need to see the returns, in case there's fraud. 
November 14, 2016	USA TODAY	How to explain Donald Trump's stunning victory? Looking back, several real-world clues should have caused me to question the supposedly sophisticated models that pointed to a comfortable Hillary Clinton win. Start with the July day I spent in Stark County, Ohio -- long a bellwether in presidential elections -- while the Republicans were having their convention in Cleveland. At a Greek restaurant in Canton, I talked to an 83-year-old businessman named Don Leuchtag about the campaign. Like a lot of the diners, he wasn't pleased that out of all the people in America, his choice had come down to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Don was torn. He didn't trust Clinton for a minute. Trump was offending a lot of people and selling a "pipe dream" about walling off America from immigrants and imports.  I checked back with Don shortly before the election to see what he had decided. He emailed me on Election Day. "In the end I held my nose and voted for Trump," he reported, because Bill and Hillary Clinton seem to believe that the rules don't apply to them. "I know Trump is an unknown card, but maybe that's what we need," he added. "We will not solve our major problems under the current people in office." As Don Leuchtag goes, I thought, so goes Stark County. So it did. (Trump beat Clinton in the county by 17 percentage points; in 2012, President Obama and Mitt Romney were virtually tied there.) As Stark County went, so went Ohio. (Trump won the state by more than 8 percentage points; in 2012, Obama won by 2 points.) And as Ohio went, so went the nation. (No Republican, Trump included, has ever captured the White House without winning the Buckeye State.) With the benefit of hindsight, that day in Stark County provided other signals about the underlying forces driving the election. Sitting at another table at the Athens restaurant was a white Canton police officer who was unhappy with Clinton's support of the Black Lives Matter movement, a reminder of the racial tensions never far from the surface in America. Another customer, Patrick Rimke, 64, started our conversation by mentioning something he had read that morning on Breitbart, the pro-Trump website. His comment confirmed that even older voters were bypassing traditional news media in favor of partisan news sources stoking anti-establishment fervor. In fact, Breitbart's chairman, Stephen Bannon, would soon become CEO of the Trump campaign. Trump was appealing to "people who are fed up," said Rimke. I then headed for North Canton, home to the massive brick factory where Hoover vacuum cleaners used to be manufactured. Hoover and later owners had shifted thousands of jobs to Texas, Mexico and ultimately China. The union hall across Main Street from the mostly vacant plant was about to close down for good. I asked one of the last people there, Jean Rice, who or what she blamed. "Probably NAFTA and bad trade deals," Rice replied, echoing Trump's message on the campaign trail. When people back home in deep-blue Maryland asked how Trump could possibly have won the GOP nomination, and whether he had a shot in November, I'd take out my smartphone and show them a photo of the former Hoover plant. Sure enough, Trump's improbable path to victory sliced straight through the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin and their counties flush with white, working-class voters. My final clue that an upset might be in the making came from a working-class Hispanic woman I know. A few days before Election Day, I asked her how she planned to vote. Considering Trump's denigration of Mexican immigrants and a Latina beauty queen, I presumed she'd be firmly and enthusiastically in the Clinton camp. But she said she was undecided, concerned that Clinton might end up in jail if elected. Her chauvinistic husband, she added, didn't think a woman should be president. And sure enough, surveys of people after they voted suggested that Trump did far better than expected among Hispanics, about as well as Mitt Romney did in 2012. Anecdotal evidence? Absolutely. But after this year's unexpected outcome, who are you going to believe? Pollsters, or your own eyes?
May 2, 2016	USA TODAY	Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have made white working-class resentments over international trade central to their presidential bids. But neither takes the issue seriously. Ironically, the one who does is the candidate most identified with free trade: Hillary Clinton. Trump and Sanders often blame China for taking American jobs. In this regard, they are right. Between 2001 and 2007, job growth in U.S. manufacturing was 30% lower than it would have been had Congress not passed "permanent normal trade relations" between the two countries in 2000. According to a 2013 study by economists Peter Schott and Justin Pierce, the Great Recession is partly to blame for lost jobs and lost job growth, but so is this "major change in U.S. trade policy."  Lost job growth isn't due to bad deals with China because the United States does not have bilateral trade agreements with that country. China and America are, however, members of the World Trade Organization, which writes the rules of commerce. A condition of membership was lifting trade barriers. To influence commerce rules, and to benefit from China's liberalized economy, the U.S. dropped tariffs on Chinese imports. Trump and Sanders may blame trade deals for the plight of the white working class, but the real issue is a global economy. That is the world we live in and the reason President Obama is seeking congressional approval of the gigantic Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). It's to the advantage of the United States, he says, to help write the rules of the global economy. At the same time, Obama has proposed many ways of helping people who feel the brunt of the global economy, including free community college and tax credits for manufacturing communities. Nor has he stood idle while China breaks WTO rules: In March, the Commerce Department announced a new 266% tariff on Chinese steel being dumped onto the U.S. market. A complaint made a year ago with the WTO has forced China to stop subsidizing companies exporting seafood, textiles and other goods. Former secretary of State Clinton was for the TPP before she was against it, and she might yet be for it once again. Contrast that with Trump, who has called the 12-nation TPP pact "insanity," and Sanders, who says it's "disastrous." If Clinton's wobbly on the TPP, she's Obama's equal in proposals to help struggling workers, and she vows to be even tougher than the president on trade violations. She has proposed appointing a "chief trade prosecutor" who reports directly to the president, and called for tripling "the number of trade enforcement officers and build new early-warning systems so we can intervene before trade violations cost American jobs." Yet trade crackdowns and help for displaced workers are only part of a solution. Another important element is holding accountable corporations that benefit from a global economy. And it is here that Clinton emerges as the most serious candidate. Clinton's claim on this is a tax proposal that gives corporations incentives to invest in the USA. According to her "clawback" plan, firms relocating overseas must repay any taxpayer assistance they ever received. As Clinton told the New York Daily News, tax relief is given in exchange for creating jobs. There was, she said, "an implicit bargain." Elizabeth Warren, the progressive icon, invoked the same implicit bargain while running for the Senate in 2012. Corporations are part of communities with multiple stakeholders, she said: "Part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along." Clinton's proposal to make firms stay or pay is good policy that is also good politics. Given how closely her views resemble Sen. Warren's, it's ironic that the presidential candidate most identified with free trade could be the most progressive. John Stoehr is a lecturer in political science at Yale and a contributing writer at Washington Monthly. 
January 23, 2017	USA TODAY	Rex Tillerson has much to commend him as his nomination to become secretary of State comes up for a vote today in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Tillerson displayed considerable achievement by rising to become chief executive officer of ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest and most successful companies. He knows leaders around the globe.  He has the backing of some well-respected foreign policy experts; on Sunday, he picked up important support from Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham. And Tillerson, 64, was a better choice than the bombastic John Bolton and Rudy Giuliani, who Donald Trump also considered for State. Yet there are also several reasons for reservations about Trump's choice for one of the most important national security posts. Like Trump, Tillerson is a wealthy businessman who never served a day in government.  If confirmed, he would be tasked with navigating the U.S. through  treacherous foreign policy shoals, which requires different skills than negotiating oil deals. Tillerson's rocky, day-long testimony before the Foreign Relations panel revealed causes for concern. In his opening remarks, Tillerson endorsed a U.S. foreign policy emphasizing moral leadership.  But during the question-and-answer sessions, he repeatedly expressed caution when it came to criticizing some of the world's most flagrant examples of human rights violations. He declined comment about the thousands slaughtered in Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's ruthless war on drugs, and when asked Russia's merciless bombing of civilians in Syria, Tillerson managed only an understated "that is not acceptable behavior." His muted response on Russia was especially disconcerting because of concerns about Tillerson's close ties to Moscow and Trump's obsequiousness toward President Vladimir Putin. By comparison, Tillerson was alarmingly hawkish about China's occupation of disputed reefs in the South China Sea . A firmer response to China's actions is appropriate, but  he advocated sending China "a clear signal that first, the island building stops, and second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed." Tillerson's response sounded very much like fighting words, not someone who wants to be the nation's chief diplomat. Perhaps most troubling was how Tilllerson seemed to walk back his widely publicized concerns about global warming, views many thought would be important in a Trump cabinet  with with so many climate-change skeptics. The former fossil-fuel executive disagreed that climate change is a major national security risk and failed to offer strong support for the Paris Agreement to limit  carbon emissions. To his credit, Tillerson did draw some important distinctions with Trump, supporting the NATO alliance (which Trump has suggested is obsolete) and favoring a Pacific trade agreement that the new president opposes. In fact, if Tillerson is confirmed, as appears likely, his true test is likely to be his ability to push back simultaneously against foreign adversaries and the ill-considered foreign policy demands of his erratic boss. 
April 1, 2016	USA TODAY	About the only person Donald Trump hasn't insulted in his march toward the Republican presidential nomination is Ronald Reagan. But he'd surely find fault with Reagan on the subject of trade deficits. Our 40th president said they are not necessarily a bad thing. Trade deficits show, Reagan said, that the U.S. economy is strong, and that the American people have money to spend. Trump, by contrast, calls them terrible and a sign that we're "losing." Countries that have trade surpluses with us are ripping us off at every turn, in his view.  Trump's No. 1 culprit is China. The way he talks, you'd think the Chinese are 10 feet tall and much more clever than we are. But his premise is wrong. The U.S. has far better long-term economic prospects than China, which means President Obama was in a position of strength when he met Thursday with President Xi Jinping. No one denies that China has been cheating when it comes to trade. The World Trade Organization has sided with the United States in at least three major cases in recent years, cases in which Washington accused Beijing of employing illegal trade tactics. No less a free trader than Obama himself has slapped anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese goods to protect American jobs. Our trade deficit with the People's Republic last year hit a record $366 billion -- a cool $1 billion a day. Even so, that's well below Trump's exaggerated figure of "over $500 billion." If China is really winning, then why have global business executives said the USA is the best place in the world in which to invest and do business? The AT Kearney Foreign Direct Investment Confidence survey says America "takes first place for the third straight year, as it leads all countries in terms of macroeconomic outlook. Forty-six percent say they are more optimistic about the U.S. economy's outlook than they were a year ago, and only 10% say they are more pessimistic." Executives were less cheerful about China. If China is winning, then why do more U.S. manufacturing executives say that from now until 2020, they are more likely to add factory capacity here than in China? And why do increasing numbers of them say they are now bringing jobs back? And if China's winning, then why are the wealthiest and savviest Chinese bailing on their own country? The Bank of China and Hurun (a marketing group that tracks wealthy Chinese) said in 2013 that more than half of China's millionaires want to leave or have taken steps to do so. Other studies say they've already moved $658 billion out, a figure that could double by the end of this year. When your best and brightest are racing for the exits, is that, to use Trump's binary way of thinking, winning or losing? Let's follow the money in another way that also undercuts Trump's economic patriotism. China is pouring investment capital into the USA: nearly $16 billion last year, up 30% from 2014. The Rhodium Group, which tracks all this, says close to $2 billion was for "greenfield" projects: brand new manufacturing facilities built from scratch. China is attracted to the United States for all the right reasons: a skilled labor force, low cost of energy, minimal bureaucracy (if you disagree with this, you've never been to China), property rights and contract enforcement. The fact is, for an increasing number of Chinese investors, Adam Smith and John Locke "trump" Karl Marx. Why does Trump think China is so smart and we're so dumb? I say the opposite is true. China has an environmental crisis on its hands, and its economy is slowing rapidly. As its wages rise, millions of manufacturing jobs are leaving, as other countries do to it what it did to us. Beijing's communist bosses are so afraid of their own citizens that they employ a cyber army of 2 million to block social media and crimp the free exchange of threatening ideas. This is not the sign of a confident government embracing the future; it's a sign of a fearful one. Trump's read on China is based on a simplistic emphasis on its strengths that ignores its many weaknesses. You know when China will worry me? When it stops investing in America. It's great that foreigners have confidence in us -- more, it seems, than do some of our own would-be leaders.

May 11, 2016	USA TODAY	Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton in West Virginia's Democratic primary Tuesday, while Donald Trump, with no remaining challengers, claimed an easy victory there and in Nebraska among Republicans. While Clinton's loss will probably matter little to her presidential nominating battle with Sanders, it is a powerful reminder of her challenges in a general election match-up with Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. West Virginia has a large number of working-class white voters, the demographic Trump hopes will carry him to victory in Rust Belt states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio in November.  Clinton's performance in West Virginia -- a state she won by a wide margin in the 2008 primaries -- could point to problems with a  voting bloc that supported her husband during the more economically prosperous 1990s. These same voters feel left behind as manufacturing jobs have disappeared and the coal industry has declined amid a shift to cleaner sources of energy. Trump vows to bring coal and manufacturing jobs back to depressed pockets of Appalachia by slapping tariffs on China and reworking trade deals. Alternatively, Clinton's vision is to move these communities to a new generation of jobs, acknowledging a coal industry renaissance is not in the cards. In a speech at southeastern Ohio brewery last week, Clinton said coal is still a part of the nation's energy supply, but even big coal-consuming nations such as China are starting to burn less. It's not a message West Virginians seem to want to hear. Trump leads Clinton by 27 percentage points in West Virginia, according to a recent Public Policy Polling survey. Along with his performance in West Virginia with white, working-class voters, he's picking up steam in more critical Midwestern swing states that Clinton has to carry in November. Democrats have assumed Clinton would beat Trump in states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan, which voted twice for Barack Obama and are populated by the blue-collar, union households that have been the Democratic Party's lifeblood for generations. Yet a new Quinnipiac University Swing State Poll shows Clinton and Trump in a dead heat in two of them: Ohio and Pennsylvania. Clinton is trying to cast Trump as a fraud whose rhetoric about helping lower-income Americans does not match his policies. On Tuesday in Louisville, she said Trump "actually stood on a debate stage and argued that Americans are paid too much, not too little," she said. In West Virginia, Clinton suffered from her association with Obama, whose policies have accelerated the nation's shift to greener sources of energy without providing a safety net for workers dependent on the coal industry, according to Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat who represents the state. "It's been very harmful to the Democratic Party in West Virginia," Manchin said during a recent Clinton campaign stop in Charleston. On the Republican side, Trump for the first time faced a cleared field in GOP primaries in West Virginia and Nebraska (Democrats held a caucus there in March). His two remaining rivals, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, dropped out of the Republican race last week after Trump's win in the Indiana primary. Trump was 169 delegates short of the 1,237 needed to officially clinch the nomination before Tuesday's primaries. In the Democratic race, Clinton led Sanders, a Vermont senator, by nearly 300 pledged delegates entering Tuesday's contest. West Virginia had 29 delegates at stake. Given the Democratic Party's proportional allocation system, Sanders stood to only modestly boost his delegate total with his win. Sanders, who also won last week's Indiana primary, pledged to "take the political revolution" to the convention during a rally in Sacramento on Monday. 
January 10, 2017	USA TODAY	In the normal course of business, it's hard to get America's fractious intelligence agencies to agree that 2 + 2 = 4. So the unclassified version of their assessment about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee is all the more remarkable.  The FBI, the CIA and the NSA wrote with "high confidence" (itself rare in the intelligence world) that "Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election," and two of three agencies had high confidence the goal was to help Donald Trump. Yes, the intelligence community has made mistakes, most notoriously regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. But in this case, it is obvious the spies have such a high degree of proof -- likely including electronic intercepts of conversations and human intelligence reports as well as forensic investigation of the hacked computers -- that there is no disputing their bottom line.  Even Trump, who has consistently refused to admit that the DNC was hacked by Russians rather than  some 400-pound couch potato, felt compelled after receiving the classified version of the assessment to issue a statement that did not doubt its conclusions. Yet even then he would not admit that the culprit was solely Russia. His statement referred not only to Russia but also to "China, other countries, outside groups and people" that "are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations, including the Democratic National Committee." He's right that China and other states consistently engage in cyber espionage, but Russia is unique for leaking emails in order to  swing an American election. Trump's statement further claimed, "There was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines." It's true there was no tampering with voting machines, but how can Trump state so confidently that the Russian hack had "no effect" on the outcome of an election that was decided by 80,000 people in three states? If the hack was so inconsequential, why did Trump hype the resulting information -- about how the DNC supposedly favored Hillary Clinton in the primaries -- to try to persuade Bernie Sanders' supporters not to vote for her in the general election? Why did he constantly bring up WikiLeaks in the final month of the campaign and say the group had "done a job" on her? One suspects Trump of a guilty conscience, given that within hours he was back to blaming the victims rather than perpetrators for the hack. "Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place," he tweeted. As investment manager Patrick Chovanec quipped: "This is like G. Gordon Liddy saying the DNC should have installed better locks." Trump has often expressed admiration for Putin and never criticized him. Recently, for example, he tweeted his congratulations -- "Great move on delay (by V. Putin). I always knew he was very smart!" -- when the Russian strongman refused to react in kind to President Obama's expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats in retaliation for the  hacking. That pattern did not change even after the release of the damning intelligence report. Trump had not one word of disapprobation for the Russian meddling in our election. Instead, he tweeted: "Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only 'stupid' people, or fools, would think that it is bad!" In truth, no American wants a bad relationship with Russia. But many of us have concluded that a good relationship is impossible until Putin stops invading neighboring countries (Georgia, Ukraine), stops committing war crimes (Syria), and stops trying to undermine Western institutions -- something he is doing not only in the U.S. but across Western Europe with his support of extremist parties, such as the National Front in France and even coup plotters in Montenegro. Trump, however, doesn't offer the slightest objection to Russia's egregious misconduct, which  raises the question: Why not? Is it simply admiration for the Russian dictator on the part of a president-elect who has said that Putin's Russia is "hot stuff," and that "what he's done for Russia is really amazing"? Or is  something more sinister going on? The New York Times has just published a damning investigation showing the extent to which Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and newly named senior adviser, is heavily dependent on shadowy Chinese and Russian financiers closely linked to their governments. Might the Trump Organization be equally compromised? We have no way of knowing because Trump is so opaque about his finances. But his adherence to a slavishly pro-Putin line, if it continues in office, will certainly raise such suspicions.

November 17, 2016	USA TODAY	When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets with President-elect Donald Trump in New York on Thursday, much will be at stake -- for both sides. Abe is likely to try to salvage at least part of a major trade deal, secure a commitment to Japan's continued defense and establish a working relationship with the next U.S. leader who has a history of bashing Japan and campaigned on a platform of "America First."  The meeting will be Trump's first with a foreign leader since his election victory last week. He has yet to announce his foreign policy team, and people overseas -- particularly in Asia, where China has mounted a challenge to U.S. power and influence -- will look for assurances that the United States will remain engaged. "It's still too soon to know what effect Trump will have on East Asia, or Japan in particular, until we know more about his specific policies and appointments," said Sean King, an East Asia specialist with the Park Securities consulting firm. "Abe can underscore our two countries' shared values and stress how the U.S.-Japan alliance helps keep open markets, energy routes and world shipping lanes ... and convey to the president-elect how much we could both lose if things ever went awry," he said. Few countries were as shocked by Trump's election as Japan, a longtime U.S. treaty ally and major trading partner. Abe dispatched a senior adviser to meet with Trump representatives Monday and reworked travel plans to meet with Trump this week on his way to an economic conference in Peru. During the fractious campaign, Trump promised to kill the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal that is key to Abe's economic plans. The pact, known as TPP, excludes China. Although TPP cannot go into effect without U.S. support, Abe has continued to push for ratification in Japan's parliament, the Diet, and is likely to warn Trump that rejecting the trade deal could push U.S. partners in Asia toward a separate trade deal, known as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, that includes China. "There's no doubt that there would be a pivot to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership if the TPP doesn't go forward," Abe told Diet members last week. Trump questioned whether Tokyo pays enough support for the 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan. The Defense Department has sent additional troops and its newest and most advanced aircraft, warships and weaponry to the Asia-Pacific in recent years as part of the Obama administration's "re-balance" to the region. Tokyo spends about $1.8 billion a year to  defray the costs of U.S. troops based in Japan. Trump said during the campaign that's not enough and suggested he might draw down U.S. forces if Japan doesn't spend more. The Asia Foundation, based in Washington, warned in a report this week that drawing down U.S. forces could trigger an arms race in the region and might  prompt Japan and South Korea to build their own nuclear weapons. 
October 17, 2016	USA TODAY	"I'll be honest with you. When it comes time, I probably won't know until the end," said the 63-year-old owner of a title company in this small Rust Belt city. This is what passes for certainty in Clark County, where Springfield is the county seat and largest town. It's a swing county in the quintessential swing state. In 2012, Clark County supported GOP candidate Mitt Romney, but by only 523 votes out of 64,301 cast for president. Its purple-county status isn't the only reason Clark County matters this year, either. For Trump to win the election, he must steal away blue-collar Democrats from Hillary Clinton -- people who, like Clark County's residents, generally are whiter, poorer and less educated than Ohio as a whole. Ohio has a larger share of white residents without college degrees than nearly any other swing state. That's why it has remained close or leaned a few points toward Trump while Clinton pulls ahead in other states. In Clark County, it's clear not all of these blue-collar voters are sold on Trump. His protectionist promises and rhetoric about job-stealing immigrants resonate with some of the county's fence-sitters. But many others are turned off by his inability to campaign with discipline and stay on point on the topics they care about. And despite what the stats -- and Trump -- may say, others just don't feel the desperation he describes. Even five years ago, beleaguered Clark County might have been more interested in Trump's message, said Michael McDorman, president of the Greater Springfield Chamber of Commerce and a Springfield native with deep family ties to the manufacturing industry. But now, the county is clawing its way out of its economic hole, diversifying with new service-sector jobs and rejuvenating its downtown. Even manufacturing is hiring again, bringing back blue-collar jobs. "We're starting to see a change in Springfield. We're starting to see people believe in themselves again," he said. "We're starting to see us move forward and take some risk in order to move forward." Seven years ago, Cheri Crothers returned with her husband to Springfield, her childhood home. She found a city transformed, but not for the better. She reels off a list of manufacturers that disappeared. "We were driving through Springfield, and there was closed-up Robbins & Myers; William Bailey's gone, SPECO's gone," said Crothers, a Democrat. "A lot of these manufacturers that I remember as a child growing up here, that were so active, were not here anymore." Kyle Koehler owns the tool and die company K.K. Tool Co. in Springfield and represents Clark County as a Republican in the Ohio House. The North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, became law in 1994 and was hailed by both Republicans and Democrats as a tool to eliminate barriers to trade and investment between the U.S., Canada and Mexico. In Springfield, NAFTA is still a dirty word. While other factors lured away jobs and sometimes shut down entire factories, NAFTA bears some of the blame -- and gets plenty of it. Before NAFTA, Koehler recalled, you could walk into a home improvement store and pick up steel wool made by International Steel Wool and see "Springfield, Ohio" on the back. "Because of NAFTA, that company packed up, went to Mexico and in a year folded and was gone," he said. "It was a good, vital company that was in Springfield that provided jobs, and not only was it no longer in Springfield, it no longer existed." The post-NAFTA job losses felt fatal to an economy centered on manufacturing. In 2000, 30% of the county's gross domestic product, or GDP, came from manufacturing. In 2014, only 17% did. Now, only two manufacturers -- Navistar and Honda -- break the top 10 private employers in Clark County, a list historically dominated by manufacturing. The county's top private employers are now the local health care system, Community Mercy Health Partners, and a call center for insurance company Assurant Specialty Property, according to the chamber of commerce. For McDorman, the chamber president, the past 15 years have been the aftermath of job losses that peaked at the turn of the century. The loss of good-paying manufacturing jobs gut-punched the area's middle class. In 2001, only one in five of the county's population earned lower-tier incomes. By 2014, a third of the population did, according to a Pew report this year. Median household income fell more than a quarter in 15 years, to $53,957 in 2014, according to a Pew analysis of U.S. Census data. Doane, the title company owner, said he can't bring himself to vote for Trump but understands why the candidate's message might resonate with some voters. "There's a lot of unhappy people, and they're just really unhappy with the system. And I think they think Trump is an answer," he said. Springfield's economy is changing, and its emerging future bears little resemblance to Trump's statements about a revival of manufacturing. Speedway, the convenience store chain, is expanding its headquarters in Clark County, adding 450 jobs. EF Hutton, a financial services provider, opened its doors in late September and plans to hire more than 400. McDorman said a medical supply company is planning to relocate to downtown Springfield with 300-plus jobs. Even manufacturing isn't disappearing entirely. Koehler said his business is expanding and taking back work from China. "Our heart and blood is manufacturing, but with people like EF Hutton coming to town, bringing white collar jobs, professional jobs, that's important," said Koehler, the state representative. "We've sort of diversified over the years." Lynda Smith, the Republican Party chairwoman for Clark County, says "a lot" of Democrats are asking about switching to Trump. She doesn't ask questions. Union workers, who generally vote overwhelmingly Democrat, remain a political force in Clark County. Jason Barlow, president of the United Auto Workers Local 402, which represents local workers at Navistar, said internal polling has shown some GOP union members are considering Clinton, while some Democratic members are considering Trump. On the whole, he said, the 1,200-member union is likely to break down along party lines as it has in the past. And the 4,300 union retirees might lean more toward Trump. "This election here, it's been an anomaly," he said. "Our membership has had ... interesting debates, let's just say that." The shift in Clark County's economy means the blue-collar union bloc may not matter as much as it once did. The largest voting bloc in the county, according to GOP chairwoman Smith, is undecided. "Hillary has too much baggage following her, and Donald Trump is too much of a reality TV show," said Robinette, a collections manager. ." The brothers look like Trump supporters. But looks can be deceiving. Neither plans to vote for Trump.
December 9, 2016	USA TODAY	The pro-U.S. foreign policy of South Korean President Park Geun Hye is at risk now that she appears to be on her way out over a growing corruption scandal. Park, whose approval ratings are an abysmal 4%, faces possible impeachment by South Korea's legislature  -- if she doesn't resign first -- and massive street protests over the power she is accused of granting to a controversial personal friend, Choi Soon Sil. Prosecutors allege that Choi, the daughter of a deceased cult leader who mentored Park, used her relationship with the president to extort $68 million in corporate donations to foundations Choi controlled and invested the money. Park's initial policy toward North Korea was to engage through trust-building measures, but her approach made an abrupt turnaround after the North's nuclear test in January. "It affected everything with North Korea, China and Japan," said John Delury, who teaches international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. "Now, with the equally sudden demise of the president, it puts into question the new hard-line policy." In February, Park ordered South Korean companies to pull out of the Kaesong Industrial Complex to protest a North Korean missile launch. The plant, which uses North Korean labor and South Korean management and expertise, was a major source of funds for the North and one of the few remaining avenues for cultural exchange between the two countries. Park's new approach was in line with U.S. efforts to isolate North Korea and deprive it of foreign sources of income. President Obama said in September that new and existing sanctions show North Korea there are "consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions." Kathleen Stephens, who served as U.S. ambassador to South Korea from 2008 to 2011, said opposition parties are likely to call for more active efforts to re-engage with Pyongyang on a raft of issues and to argue that Park's hard-line policy has not worked. It would be "a major project" to reopen relations with the North, but options would include a resumption of food and humanitarian aid, plus family reunions that took place in past years. Chung In Moon, a foreign affairs adviser to South Korea's opposition, called in September  for suspending joint military exercises with the United States and for encouraging dialogue with the North. Such a move by South Korea would be seen as a step toward rejecting the U.S. security umbrella in the region that has existed since the 1950s, said Yun Sun, an analyst at the Stimson Center, a Washington think-tank. After North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test, in September, Park approved the deployment of a U.S. missile-defense system called the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) to protect South Korean cities and 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in her country. The proposed deployment angered China -- South Korea's most important trading partner -- which sees the system as a threat to its aircraft and missile capabilities. The deployment is controversial among South Koreans who question the system's effectiveness, Delury said. "There is evidence already that North Koreans are figuring out a way around it," he said. South Korea's liberal opposition party, which seeks better relations with China in hopes it could temper North Korea, is among the fiercest critics of THAAD. Though the liberals may not cancel the $850 million system financed by the United States, they could probably block its expansion. If President-elect Donald Trump follows through on his campaign promise to make U.S. allies pay more for their defense, the THAAD deployment could be scrapped. Park's government ordered South Korea's military this year to exchange security information for the first time with Japan, a bitter enemy in past decades. The arrangement was encouraged by Obama and his predecessors who've long sought to reconcile the U.S. allies, so they could cooperate on security and form a unified front against North Korea and China. Many South Koreans continue to distrust Japan because of its occupation of Korea during the first half of the 20th century, said Jenny Town, assistant director of the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. "South Koreans are always very skeptical of too much military cooperation between South Korea and Japan because of the history between the two countries," she said. North Korea and China see the arrangement as "the U.S. trying to create collective security," Town said. How a post-Park South Korea balances policy toward the United States and China is hard to predict, in part because the United States is going through its own transition, Stephens said. South Korea's trade with China has gotten so big that South Koreans worry about over-dependence. "That's why the U.S. alliance has come to be more valued," Stephens said, but Korea has "a huge relationship with Beijing." As a candidate, Trump called the U.S.-Korean Free-Trade Agreement reached in 2012 a "job-killing trade deal." He threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, which would hurt the economies of all the countries in the region. To save the free-trade agreement, South Koreans would "point out increased trade and services that benefit the U.S.," Stephens said. "They're watching very closely, wondering what the new Trump administration will do." South Korea is also developing an alternative, since it shares a long history with China, and trade between the two outweighs trade with the United States and Japan combined. Many among South Korea's opposition hope to develop a more conciliatory atmosphere toward China, Sun said. The "Chinese feel confident they have a piece of critical leverage over South Korean politicians," Sun said. 
December 5, 2016	USA TODAY	America's new secretary of Defense nominee has an apparently quite divergent -- and more realistic -- sense of the world than either President-elect Donald Trump or even, in some respects, the new nominee for national security adviser, retired Army lieutenant general Michael Flynn. Trump must bring himself to tap these resources before impulse and emotions send the nation off the rails, perhaps irrevocably.  Retired Marine general James Mattis sees Russian President Vladimir Putin not through rose-colored glasses but as the autocrat that he is. Mattis recognizes the value of our Iran nuclear treaty and rather than ripping it up, he'd prefer to make sure it's enforced to the hilt. Mattis also apparently already talked Trump down off the  ledge of waterboarding as an interrogation technique, believing instead in the value of a "pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers." Even so, there's still so much  unknown about either of the two retired generals  and how they may be used in crises, or in just day-to-day phone calls or tweets. Let's hope Trump never consulted Flynn or Mattis before taking that perhaps fateful call from Taiwan's president that could push America and Asia further down a path toward conflict that Mattis could be left in the end to sort out. China's brilliant foreign minister, Wang Yi,  cut Trump some slack -- this one time -- laying the blame for the first direct conversation between a U.S. and Taiwanese president or president-elect in 37 years squarely on Taiwan's new leader, Tsai Ing-Wen. But the learning curve is pretty short and steep. Trump must learn to consult with someone wiser than he is in the world of war and diplomacy. The stakes are enormous. In Mattis, there's an individual who is deeply experienced and eminently schooled. Unlike Trump, who is not known to have read any book recently, even one with his name on the cover, Mattis has accumulated a library of more than 7,000 titles. He has even helped write The U.S. Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual with then-Gen. David Petraeus, considered a potential finalist with Mitt Romney for secretary of State. The question is how broadly real wisdom might exist in the Trump administration. If Trump had indeed planned to send a message of a deliberate and strategic pivot to India by taking a call with the prime minister of its neighbor and arch foe Pakistan, or to Beijing in Friday's call with Taiwan, then each should have been preceded by other moves to lay the groundwork so his calls won't be misinterpreted. Presidential transitions have often been used to test us by friends and foes alike. Trump would be wise not to make more foreign moves without consulting experienced hands like Mattis, or his eventual secretary of State. David A. Andelman, a member of the USA TODAY Board of Contributors, is editor-emeritus of World Policy Journal. 
July 28, 2016	USA TODAY	Angst over trade is rusting the lock Democrats have enjoyed on the industrial Midwest in recent presidential elections, turning the region into perhaps the central battleground in the contest between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. From eastern Iowa to western Pennsylvania, the Rust Belt  has proven widely and unexpectedly receptive to Trump's candidacy and may represent his only viable pathway to victory, party leaders, operatives and observers said in interviews at both party conventions over the past week. Recognizing this, both campaigns are building infrastructure in the states and formulating key decisions based on how they'll play with Midwestern voters.  "If we don't have a change of the map from Pennsylvania through Iowa, then we're not going to win this election," two-time Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum told Iowa's convention delegation in Cleveland last week. President  Obama carried Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and their collective 70 electoral votes in 2012. Should that Democratic firewall erode and some or all of those states flip to Trump, it could represent the most significant electoral swing of any region in the country: If all five went for Trump while the rest of the electoral map remained unchanged from 2012, he would win. And polling from across the region suggests Trump is competitive. Clinton holds leads in all five of those states, according to polling averages compiled by Real Clear Politics, but with margins of less than 6 percentage points. "You go right across -- Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa are all places where Trump is at or ahead of Romney's numbers," political statistician Nate Silver  told The Des Moines Register in Cleveland. Iowa, a perennial presidential swing state, sits on the far western border of the industrial crescent surrounding the Great Lakes, but appears to be among the most competitive and will be a frequent stop for both candidates in the weeks to come -- including on Thursday, when Trump makes his first visit to the state since the Feb. 1 caucuses. Consider the views of Jesse Gonzales. The 26-year-old from Lakewood, Ohio, was a magnet for  reporters on the first day of the Republican National Convention last week when he went strolling through a downtown Cleveland plaza wearing a Trump campaign hat and an AK-47 rifle strapped to his back. But the most critical political issue he saw -- besides maintaining rights of gun owners -- was a lack of economic opportunity. And he blamed trade policy for it. "The government is not being protectionist enough," Gonzales said. "It's the government's job to ensure that our economy is functional and they failed to do so. They've made sure that other country's economies flourish." Indeed, Dennis Kucinich, a former congressman from Cleveland and Democratic candidate for president, pointed to global trade and free-trade agreements as the primary factor putting the Rust Belt in play this year. "Trade has stripped this area not just of the financial power of major industries but also thousands of small manufacturing and companies" he said. "NAFTA, the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, China trade and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership all are part of a disaffection that working people have with both political parties." Kucinich, known as a liberal during his time in office, said he was not comfortable with Trump's political style but credited him with recognizing the political potency of trade and addressing the issue more clearly than any  candidate in the race. Hillary Clinton has taken a more nuanced approach on the trade issue. As first lady, a U.S. senator and secretary of State, she took a range of positions on various trade deals, and since becoming a presidential candidate she has suggested changes are necessary to the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership. Her chief Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders, ran heavily on opposition to free trade during his challenge to Clinton -- leading Trump to explicitly court Sanders voters in recent weeks. "To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests, we welcome you with open arms. People first," Trump tweeted on July 12. Santorum, who represented western Pennsylvania in Congress before going to the Senate, recalled attending a Trump event in the traditionally Democratic town of Monessen, Pa., last month and encountering several onetime Democrats now supporting the GOP nominee. "Trump is able to get voters who feel disenchanted from Democrats because Hillary Clinton is a Wall Street globalist," Santorum said. "She is a not a blue-collar, working person's candidate, and Trump is." Republicans in Cleveland contended that vice presidential nominee Mike Pence's addition to the ticket would further boost Trump's chances in the region, as the Indiana governor reflects Midwestern values and quells doubts about the nominee's inconsistent record and bombastic rhetoric. "He's a conservative, Midwestern governor who's had a good track record of bringing jobs to Indiana," Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said. "He's stable, reliable and he's both a social and economic conservative. I think he reassures people who may have had some misgivings." Clinton, in turn, is taking no chances in Iowa and across the region. After the convention, she'll travel across Pennsylvania and into Ohio for her first campaign swing as the party nominee.
November 17, 2016	USA TODAY	Donald Trump seriously thinks he can serve as president of the United States while maintaining a worldwide real estate empire. Because he is already wealthy, he argues, Americans need not worry about his trying to get richer while in office. Because his children will be running the business, he will be walled off from its decisions. And because he is forgoing the annual $400,000 presidential salary, Americans can rest assured that he will put their interests ahead of his.  Trump will soon find out how wrong he is. The problem isn't just that he stands to make money from the increased visibility his businesses will have thanks to his presidency. It is that his financial ties in foreign countries  will vastly complicate U.S. diplomacy. Trump won't be able to deal with China or Germany without the world being reminded that he is in debt to banks in those countries. He won't be able to deal with South Korea without friends and foes questioning his motives given his ties to a major defense and construction company there. If Trump does not liquidate his holdings as quickly as practically possible and select a trustee to invest his wealth within a blind trust, he threatens to hobble his presidency in the same way Bill Clinton's libido crippled his. Short of a real blind trust, his businesses will become a constant source of controversy. Trump has business partners around the globe, many of them deeply enmeshed in their nations' politics, their governments' contracting decisions and -- in many cases -- local scandals or lawsuits. According to Newsweek, the Trump Organization is heavily invested in a real estate project in the Indian state of Maharashtra, where he is at the mercy of the state government, which is investigating whether Trump's local partner properly acquired the land for the development. Trump is allied with an indicted Turkish businessman who is an adversary of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a vital but troublesome ally of the United States. And Trump has partnered with Daewoo Engineering and Construction, a company that would benefit greatly if South Korea increased its military spending as Trump has recommended. U.S. relations with India, Turkey and South Korea as well as those countries' regional rivals -- Pakistan, Greece and North Korea -- could be deeply compromised by the ongoing business deals of the Trump Organization. The same would be true with other countries when journalists and critics discover undisclosed Trump partnerships (which, like his tax returns, he steadfastly refuses to divulge). As Trump's children continue to operate his businesses across the globe and in the United States, new conflicts will arise as adventuresome businessmen with their own political and financial agendas use investments and other business deals with the Trump empire to curry favor with the  administration. If Trump does not set up a genuine blind trust, he will soon wish he had. And American voters will soon wonder why they gave the highest office in the land to someone with so many impediments to governing effectively. 
November 18, 2016	USA TODAY	Only a week after Donald Trump's election victory, the same pundits who said he could never win are making it sound like his presidency has already failed. They claim his lack of major Cabinet level appointments thus far show he is bogged down. They say his pledge to "drain the swamp" in Washington is compromised because he is surrounded by "swamp creatures." Even when Trump steps out for a private dinner with his family, the news media pack howls about a "lack of transparency." President-elect Trump is being held to an impossibly high standard, considering he won't even take office for 10 weeks. Michael Gerson griped in The Washington Post that Trump has not produced "a set of developed proposals" for his policy priorities, or indicated a "favored bill or detailed plan" for rebuilding the nation's infrastructure, or told Congress exactly how he wants to replace Obamacare. Confused, really? Because a man who won't move into the White House until mid-January hasn't submitted a comprehensive legislative agenda to a new Congress that itself hasn't convened? It would be more confusing if he had. Journalists are also quick to pounce when they sense Trump is putting daylight between his current positions and his campaign promises. Whether on Obamacare, the wall with Mexico or appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's emails, tarot-card-reading reporters have detected subtle softening, shifting, walking things back. But it is contradictory to criticize Trump for not being specific enough about implementing his agenda, and at the same time allege he is backing away from his promises. Contrast Trump's transition to President-elect Bill Clinton's. Before his inauguration, Clinton managed to flip-flop on his China policy, water down his promised middle-class tax cut, and abandon his pledge to admit Haitian refugees. Commerce Secretary-designee Ron Brown became embroiled in a scandal about corporations offering to pay for his inaugural party, and attorney general nominee Zoe Baird fell afoul of the Nannygate controversy and was thrown under the bus. As The New York Times said a few days before the inauguration, "The Clinton administration looks ready to hit the ground stumbling." Some claim that the new president's transition is dragging its feet. Politico stated that "Trump was caught flat-footed by winning," offering as evidence that "his transition team has been slow to engage with the outgoing administration." But Trump is sprinting down the track compared with Ronald Reagan's laid-back transition. The Gipper's first move was to take a short vacation on his ranch in California, where transition head Ed Meese said the president-elect "hasn't even looked at a list" of prospective appointees. Donald Trump met with President Obama a mere two days after the election, while Reagan and President Carter waited until Nov. 20 that year to sit down together at the White House. A week after, Reagan had still not reached out to his prospective Cabinet officials. Asked by a reporter outside a barbershop in Beverly Hills whether he had called any potential nominees, The Gipper simply said, "Nope." Maybe Trump's unprecedented rise to the presidency has trained reporters to expect more from him than they did from his predecessors. But they are a little too demanding under the circumstances. People in a hurry to declare Trump's presidency failed should at least have the courtesy to first let it begin. They should let Trump be Trump and see what happens. James S.

October 17, 2016	USA TODAY	America needs a functional working relationship with Russia. Hillary Clinton understands its importance, having attempted to "reset" relations at the beginning of her tenure as secretary of State.  As late as June 2013, Clinton reportedly told a private audience that she "would love it if we could continue to build a more positive relationship with Russia." Donald Trump agrees, but his reasoning is perhaps clearer than Clinton's. He views the world through the lens of foreign policy realism -- the belief that nation-states remain dominant in the global system, and countries seek to pursue their own national interests. Trump argues that America should develop a foreign policy that recognizes and addresses the most direct threat to our security. He contends that the Islamic State terrorist group, having openly declared its intention to attack the USA, must be dealt with immediately. Throughout history, nations have often understood that the enemy of our enemy is our friend. As the United States allied with the Soviet Union to defeat Nazi Germany, Washington should seek similar cooperation with Moscow to defeat ISIL. Chinese expansionism and militarization, as witnessed in the South China Sea, could also shape Trump's Russia policy. He understands that China, given its economic prowess, is emerging as a superpower. Trump has warned, "Don't ever let China and Russia get together." Pursuing policies that increase the probability of a Sino-Russian alliance are reckless and potentially place America in grave danger. Certainly, there is much noise surrounding Trump's Russia policy, the vast majority of which is partisan chatter. When our national interests are considered through the lens of common sense, the current dangerous level of hostility between the United States and Russia -- as evidenced by Mr. Putin's recent nuclear saber rattling -- is not justified. Trump's instincts to avoid a massive divergence of interests with Russia are correct. Given the geopolitical stakes, it's certainly worth a try. George David Banks, a former CIA analyst and diplomat, is executive vice president of the American Council for Capital Formation. 
November 30, 2016	USA TODAY	For Dave Shogren, Donald Trump's campaign-trail threats to impose massive tariffs on imports from China and Mexico were more than just vote-rousing bluster. They were a loaded gun pointed at the heart of his St. Louis-based food-export business. Shogren knew those countries almost certainly would respond in kind, pummeling his sales to China, which account for half his business. "Every time Trump threw China under the bus, I cringed," says Shogren, CEO of U.S. International Foods, which exports products such as snack foods, nuts and soft drinks. So he has taken a flurry of trips to his secondary Asian markets in recent months to develop sales leads in case the U.S. finds itself in a trade war with China. Since Trump won the presidential race, many U.S. importers and exporters fear his bare-knuckled ultimatums could significantly dent their revenue if he follows through.  "People are concerned and are just starting to take a look at where they're vulnerable," says Marianne Rowden, head of the American Association of Exporters and Importers. Few may be more worried than Boeing. A recent editorial in China's state-run Global Times asserts China "will take a tit-for-tat approach" if Trump gets tough on trade. "A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus, U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted." Boeing spokeswoman Kate Bernard says, "Anything that undermines our competitive position is concerning." Boeing is the largest U.S. exporter with about 70% of its revenue derived from abroad, and China is its biggest customer. Bernard says Boeing executives "are looking forward to working with the (Trump) administration to protect our markets and interests overseas," adding that "the losers (in a trade skirmish) are American workers." Boeing employs 140,000 in the U.S. All told, "We have 11.5 million jobs today that depend solely on exports," Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker said in an interview. "If we start a trade war, don't underestimate. ... There will be consequences." For his part, Trump has dialed back his harshest rhetoric since he won the presidential race. One of his economic advisers, private equity investor Wilbur Ross, told Yahoo Finance, "There aren't going to be trade wars." Rather, he said, administration officials will coax trading partners like China and Mexico to buy more goods from the U.S. Still, even "an aborted trade war" -- in which Trump uses threats as a cudgel and then backs off -- could set off financial market turmoil and a shift in supply chains that leads to higher import prices or product shortages, according to a September report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Besides slapping 35% tariffs on Mexico and 45% on China, Trump has threatened to withdraw from the World Trade Organization and rip up existing deals, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. In the end, any restraints on imports are likely to be more modest. But with the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services totaling $531.5 billion in 2015, "we are now moving into a different area," says Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations. "Trump sees it as far more of a zero-sum game. And he sees the U.S. as a loser." Trump's goal: prevent U.S. manufacturers from offshoring their production and convince those that already have to move back to the U.S. Some of them will, but most are likely to relocate to other low-cost countries to skirt any new duties, says Peterson senior fellow Gary Hufbauer. That, he says, could force Trump to hit those countries with tariffs as well, spawning new trade battles. Meanwhile, new tariffs would cause U.S. import prices to rise, increasing costs for U.S. consumers. And limiting imports would hurt U.S. companies, such as auto manufacturers that source parts from Mexico. Exporters, particularly in agriculture, would suffer as affected countries retaliate. A full trade war would mean the loss of 4.8 million U.S. jobs, while an aborted conflict would cost 1.3 million jobs, Peterson estimates. "Big companies don't like uncertainties" and are likely already considering early contingency plans, says Peterson senior fellow Sherman Robinson. So are smaller firms. U.S. International Foods has done well because Chinese groceries trust the quality of food made in America, Shogren says. But cashews, for example, are already cheaper from Vietnamese suppliers, and supermarkets would readily switch if tariffs drove up his prices further. Since August, he has been on multiple trade missions to Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Cambodia to expand his customer base. WIN-911, of Austin, which sells software for factory automation, relies on exports for about 15% of its revenue, and that's expected to grow to about 50% in three years, leading to a pickup in hiring, says company Chairman Robert Brooker. But noting that China and Mexico make up 20% of his exports, he worries about "retaliatory tariffs or other trade restraints from these and other countries that would impede our future growth." U.S. pork producers, which export about a quarter of their products, are already hurting from a glut that has depressed prices. If there were new tariffs from China or Mexico, "They'll just cut production," says David Warner, spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council. That would push up prices for U.S. consumers. Importers are also nervous, especially small firms that rely on cheaper overseas products to compete with larger companies, says Todd McCracken, president of the National Small Business Association. For example, there are U.S. suppliers of the molds that Progressive Molding Technologies needs to make the medical devices and other plastic products it churns out for its business customers. But the cost from Chinese suppliers is about 55% less, saving his customers tens of thousands of dollars per mold and driving the Medina, Ohio, company's growth the past eight years, says President Laird Daubenspeck. Even if 45% tariffs were added to the Chinese molds, he would stick with them because they'd still be 10% cheaper than the U.S. versions, he says. But his sales would be hurt substantially because customers would drop products too costly to roll out, jeopardizing his plan to add six workers to his staff of 10. Only Chinese suppliers make certain hydraulic parts in large quantities for the construction equipment produced by Cincinnati-based Mesa industries, says CEO Terry Segerberg. Without it, "We would pretty much be up a creek," she says. Despite the jitters, business leaders are approaching the new administration with a wait-and-see attitude. "Trade is very much going to be at a pause now," says John Engler, president of the Business Roundtable. "I think (business CEOs) are very hopeful that economic growth will be a top priority. No one's pressing the panic button and saying the world is ending."
December 7, 2016	USA TODAY	President-elect Donald Trump's controversial phone call with President Tsai Ing-wen does not signal a change in China policy but simply reflects "a way for us to express our respect for the U.S. election," Tsai said Tuesday.  "One phone call does not mean a policy shift," Tsai told USA TODAY. "We all see the value of stability in the region." Her 10-minute call Friday with Trump overturned decades of diplomatic protocol. It was the first known contact between a president or president-elect and a Taiwanese leader since the United States ended formal relations with the island in 1979. The call riled China, which considers Taiwan a province, not an independent country. China's Foreign Ministry said Monday it had "no comment on what motivated the Trump team" to accept the call.  Trump referred to Tsai as "president," a grave transgression from Beijing's point of view. "China showed self-restraint," Chui-Chen Chiu, deputy minister of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said Monday. 
January 24, 2017	USA TODAY	If there were any doubts that Donald Trump would vigorously pursue the anti-trade agenda he campaigned on, he put those to rest on Monday. On his first full weekday in office, Trump announced the United States' withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. He signaled he would renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. And, for good measure, he reiterated his threat of a border tax on products made by companies that move abroad.  Taken together, these steps repudiate decades of policies, pursued by presidents of both parties, aimed at lowering trade barriers. These are also misguided moves likely to harm the U.S. economy far more than they help. The arduously negotiated TPP is -- or perhaps we should now say "was" -- America's best hope for expanding its economic influence in Asia and limiting the influence of China, which is not part of the pact. Now, the remaining 11 nations will have to decide whether to ratify the pact on their own, do nothing, or join an alternative accord that China is pitching, one that puts China at its center. It is hard to imagine a more counterproductive policy for America's interests than pulling out of the TPP, which was already on life support in Congress. But if one could be imagined, it would pulling out of NAFTA. To be sure, Trump says only that he wants to "renegotiate" the 1994 deal among the United States, Canada and Mexico. But what he means by that is anyone's guess. The pact eliminated tariffs on goods moving between the  countries in it. Does he expect Canada and Mexico to accept U.S. goods duty-free while the U.S. imposes duties on their goods? One potentially useful approach to renegotiating NAFTA would be to add sections on currency manipulation, and trade from the digital economy. The irony is that these provisions are included in TPP. It would be awkward, to say the least, to update NAFTA with provisions carved from the corpse of TPP. Trump's rhetoric about NAFTA being "the worst trade deal maybe ever" is way over the top. Since its adoption, Canada and Mexico have become far and away the United States' largest export markets. At $312 billion annually, exports to Canada are more than our exports to all European Union countries combined. At $240 billion, exports to Mexico are slightly less than exports to the EU. Canada and Mexico maintain manageable trade surpluses with the U.S. that are much smaller than those of China, Japan and Germany - none of which has a trade pact with America. Since NAFTA went into effect, U.S. economic output per person has surged by 40% after adjusting for inflation. And rising incomes in Mexico have caused once bounteous rates of illegal immigration to slow to a trickle. Trump's trade policies might benefit a sliver of U.S. manufacturing workers. But protectionism is likely to set off rounds of retaliation that will end up harming the American economy as a whole and raising prices on imported goods -- increases that will be most harmful to lower income people, including the many who voted for Trump. 
March 22, 2016	USA TODAY	In 1992, independent presidential candidate Ross Perot predicted the North American Free Trade Agreement would produce a "giant sucking sound" of U.S. jobs fleeing to low-wage Mexico. A quarter-century later, another billionaire businessman, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, is picking up where Perot left off by bashing NAFTA and other trade agreements as bad deals for America and its workers. "I think NAFTA has been a disaster. I think our current deals are a disaster," Trump told CNN last year. Recently, he has been joined  by Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, whose message resonates in states such as Michigan that have lost manufacturing jobs to foreign trading partners ranging from Mexico to China. "Our disastrous trade policies for the past 30 or 40 years have had a horrendous impact on the lives of millions of working Americans," Sanders tweeted March16.  The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank partly funded by unions, estimated  more than 850,000 jobs have been lost due to NAFTA since the agreement was enacted in 1994. During that time, the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico swung from a $1.7billion U.S. surplus in 1993 to a $61.4billion deficit in 2012, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. A fair assessment of the impact of free trade requires more than counting the number of lost U.S. jobs, economists say. Opening U.S. borders to imports also lowers prices for consumers and creates jobs for Americans who distribute or sell imports. Trade also fuels economic growth in developing nations, which increases demand for U.S. exports and creates new manufacturing and service jobs in the United States. Mauro Guillen, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, doesn't dispute the validity of 850,000 jobs lost because of NAFTA, but said they likely would have disappeared even without that deal. "They would have gone somewhere else. Auto, textiles, toys, consumer electronics, auto parts -- they're also made in Asia." Adds Robert Scott, EPI's director of trade and manufacturing policy: "The most important element of trade is who wins and loses. Exports support domestic jobs. Imports displace jobs." Trade deficit with China: Normal trade relations with China signed by President Clinton in 2000 and China's membership in the World Trade Organization in 2001 fueled the Asian country's emergence as a powerhouse exporter of manufactured goods. As a result, the U.S. trade deficit with China has grown to $365.7billion in 2015 from $83.8billion in 2000. About 3.5million jobs were lost due to the trade deficit with China, EPI's Scott said. Job loss ripple effect: As manufacturing jobs fade, so do service jobs that support them, such as accounting and legal services, Scott said. "Those services used to be counted as manufacturing jobs," he said. "The truth is, each manufacturing job supports two additional jobs in the economy." In all, about 70,000 factories have closed and 5million jobs were lost in manufacturing since 2000 because of trade with Europe, China and other countries  now part of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, an agreement among 12 Pacific Rim countries  awaiting congressional approval, Scott said. Lower wages: Expanded trade  has suppressed wages, said Josh Bivens, EPI's research and policy director. Annual wages for full-time U.S. workers without a four-year  degree fell about $1,800 in 2011 because of free trade, Bivens wrote in January 2015. Lower-priced goods: Imports help to keep prices low, a benefit as wages rise slowly. Middle-class consumers gain "an estimated 29% of their purchasing power from trade," according to the Council of Economic Advisers. "This is especially important for middle-class consumers who spend a larger share of their disposable income on heavily traded food and clothing items." More export-created jobs: U.S. companies need more designers and R&D engineers as demand for their products grows in foreign markets. In turn, their suppliers hire more workers. American companies benefit from heightened competition from foreign players in their sectors. About one in four manufacturing jobs are supported by exports, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. And exports supported 6.2million jobs in 2013, it said. In 2014, U.S. manufacturing exports reached a record $1.4trillion, and all exports rose by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2014, the Obama administration said. Higher foreign demand: Raising living standards of trading partners means foreign consumers gain buying power to purchase U.S. goods and services, and they spend more when they travel, as evidenced by Chinese tourists flocking to the USA. "The U.S. as a country that's promoting free trade is a good thing," Guillen said. He said European, Japanese and Korean companies have moved manufacturing facilities to Mexico to be closer to their most important customer, the U.S. More than 500,000 American jobs "are supported by imports of clothes and toys from China alone," according to policy analysts Bryan Riley and Anthony Kim of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Less Mexican immigration: NAFTA's role in boosting the Mexican economy has benefited the U.S. by reversing the flood of Mexicans streaming across the border. Mexicans can find more good-paying jobs at home, such as in the auto industry, which has overtaken Japan in the number of vehicles exported to the U.S. By 2020, Mexico will account for about a quarter of all auto vehicles produced in North America, according to IHS Automotive. "In the last couple of years, immigration by Mexicans (to the U.S.) has been negative," Guillen said, noting the number of Mexicans returning home now exceeds those entering the U.S. "NAFTA has been successful in helping Mexico develop enough to slow that down." 
December 20, 2016	USA TODAY	Smog and pollution blanketed cities across northern China Monday, renewing debate over U.S. role in resolving global environmental issues. To me this smog problem in China proves that President-elect Donald Trump is correct. Why should Americans contribute more of our hard-earned tax dollars to China or India?  We still contribute more carbon dioxide emissions per capita than China. Coal is on its way out. Innovation in clean energy can provide jobs, profits and clean air. It is a win-win. America must lead or fall behind and lose to innovators elsewhere. Welcome to Donald Trump's America, where the Environmental Protection Agency is not needed and global warming is a hoax. The issue of pollution in China is why it is good that in the USA we pay attention to our environment. Not one U.S. city is listed in the top 1,000 of the world's worst polluters, according to the World Health Organization. Our incoming president and his Cabinet will sadly do nothing about climate change or environmental issues. So, moot point. Heavy export fees for anything being shipped to America from China. Until the pollution is under control. I find President-elect Donald Trump's decision to nominate the leader of one of the world's largest and most environmentally disastrous oil companies to serve as secretary of State unacceptable. ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson's nomination is a direct threat to the clean air, clean water and response to climate change necessary for the health of Americans. ExxonMobil not only deliberately concealed its knowledge of climate change for decades, but is also responsible for one of the costliest environmental disasters in history. We need foreign policy leaders who will address the climate change threat.
September 8, 2016	USA TODAY	Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton vied for the title of commander in chief Wednesday, each touting their own experience and saying the other lacks the judgment and temperament to lead the nation's armed forces in perilous times. During a "Commander in Chief Forum" sponsored by NBC News, Clinton, a former secretary of State, stressed her support of the raid in 2011 that killed 9/11 plotter Osama bin Laden. She said she has the essential quality for the job of president: "steadiness -- an absolute rock steadiness " The former first lady and U.S. senator said it was "a mistake" to use private email while at the State Department, but she denied that she mishandled classified information.  Trump, appearing after Clinton at the NBC/MSNBC forum, cited problems in the Middle East, China and elsewhere that he blamed on the policies of President Obama and Clinton. "We need change," the New York businessman said, arguing that he will bring a "common-sense" approach to the demands of being commander in chief. During a national security speech earlier in the day, Trump attacked Clinton for her support of military action in Iraq and Libya, saying, "She's trigger-happy and very unstable." At the forum, Clinton called her vote in favor of the Iraq War a mistake, but she noted that Trump also initially supported the invasion in 2003 and has shifted his position in the years since. "I have taken responsibility for my decision," Clinton said. "He refuses to take responsibility for his support. ... That is a judgment issue." Trump told the forum he was "totally against the war in Iraq" because it destabilized the Middle East. "I have good judgment," he said. NBC News moderator Matt Lauer asked the candidates to discuss their own ideas and refrain from attacking their opponent, a request not always honored. The candidates took questions from veterans invited to participate in the forum. Trump said praise from Russian President Vladimir Putin would not affect his policy toward Russia. He said Putin has "been a leader far more than our president has been a leader." In his speech earlier Wednesday, Trump proclaimed a goal of "Peace Through Strength." He told an invited crowd at Philadelphia's Union League club that he wants a foreign policy "focused on advancing America's core national interests -- so important -- promoting regional stability and ... easing the tensions within our very troubled world." Clinton unveiled a list of endorsements from 95 retired generals and admirals -- most of whom had previously announced their support  -- who cited her years as secretary of State and as a U.S. senator in contrast to the New York businessman who lacks experience in government and has attacked global allies as well as adversaries. Clinton "is the only candidate that has the experience, temperament, critical thinking and level-headed leadership to keep America safe and our partnerships strong," retired Air Force general Lloyd Newton said. Clinton communication director Jennifer Palmieri said Trump is reduced to "taunts and insults" because he cannot defend his own record. "You could dismiss these actions as insecure schoolyard behavior, but this man is running to be president of the United States," she said. Trump cited his own endorsements from 88 generals and admirals Tuesday.  Wednesday, he called for increased defense spending and an end to the automatic series of congressional budget cuts known as sequestration. He said that would permit the financing of more submarines, ships and troops. The GOP candidate did not supply an overall cost estimate for his plans, though he said "budget reforms" and the collection of unpaid taxes would help finance them. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reported that Trump's plans would cost $150 billion, even if his cost offsets materialized. The Clinton campaign released an ad this week showing Trump making remarks viewed by some as disparaging toward the military, including an attack on Arizona Sen. John McCain, a former Vietnam prisoner of war. Rucker Culpepper, who runs Clinton's get-out-the-vote effort for military veterans' families, said, "Trump has been disrespecting our veterans and military for decades, proving he's unqualified and temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief."

November 10, 2016	USA TODAY	Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election Tuesday is likely to intensify business uncertainty in the near term and slow economic growth  the next few years as the U.S.  retreats from open-trade policies that have defined the past generation and cracks down on undocumented workers, economists say. Experts  have tamped down forecasts calling for a  recession by 2018 based on the assumption that even a Republican Congress will pass only modified versions of Trump's proposals. Some economists say the Federal Reserve is likely to forgo an anticipated interest rate hike in December and  keep rates lower for longer, mitigating some of the damage to  growth and financial markets. "It's not a cataclysmic event for the economy," says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. But, he adds, "at the very least, it means the economy will grow more slowly." Many firms are likely to be gripped by anxiety. "The uncertainty ... will cause businesses to be more cautious in their hiring and investment," Zandi says. The uneasiness will be greatest for multinationals that depend on exports for much of their revenue and businesses that employ legal and illegal immigrants, says economist Gus Faucher of PNC Financial Services Group. Overall, Zandi expects the economy to grow an average 1.75% a year in Trump's term, down from a 2% baseline, creating 400,000 fewer jobs annually. Trump wants to slash taxes across the board for households by combining the seven tax brackets into three. The top rate would fall to 33% from 39.6%. All Americans would pay less taxes, but the biggest benefits would go to the wealthy, according to the Tax Policy Center. The savings should boost consumer spending  the next two years, Zandi says. Corporate tax rates would plunge to 15% from 35%, and the rate for smaller businesses that pay the personal rate would drop to 15%. That should help make the USA a more attractive location for multinationals. Tax revenue would fall by $6.2 trillion over the next decade, the TPC says. Trump says the shortfall could be closed by new revenue from a more vibrant economy and spending cuts. Zandi expects a debt-wary Congress to pass only about a third of Trump's cuts. Still, he says, the deficit would swell and interest rates would rise, curbing borrowing and economic activity. Trump is likely to make good on his pledge to declare China a currency manipulator because of its efforts to push down the value of the yuan, Zandi says. Trump has threatened tariffs of 45% on Chinese imports and 35% on Mexican products, and wants to kill a proposed trade deal with Pacific Rim countries. More likely, Zandi says, are modest tariffs and tougher inspection and other standards that curb imports, raising prices for U.S. consumers. That could spark retaliation by affected countries. Trump aims to coax manufacturers that have moved jobs abroad to return to the USA and discourage offshoring by U.S. manufacturers. Zandi says such a scenario is unlikely because of uncertainty over whether the trade barriers will be permanent. Faucher says the tariffs are unlikely to outweigh offshoring's other benefits, such as lower overseas wages and taxes. Trump wants to deport millions of undocumented immigrants and build a wall along the Mexican border. Undocumented workers make up about 5% of the labor force, and the departure of some would make it tougher for employers to find employees, Zandi says. Trump  unveiled a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that his advisers say  would add nothing to the deficit and create 13 million jobs. Private firms would invest $167billion funded by tax credits passed by Congress, and the rest would be financed by debt, due to low interest rates. 
November 15, 2016	USA TODAY	President-elect Donald Trump spoke by phone Monday with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, whom he praised as a strong leader during the U.S. presidential campaign. "During the call, the two leaders discussed a range of issues including the threats and challenges facing the United States and Russia, strategic economic issues and the historical U.S.-Russia relationship that dates back over 200 years," the Trump transition team said in a statement.  Trump spoke late Sunday with another key world leader: Chinese President Xi Jinping. They agreed to meet "at any early date," according to statements from both camps. As for Putin, a statement from the Trump camp said, "The leaders established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another, and President-elect Trump stated that he believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward." The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin congratulated Trump, and pledged to build "dialogue with the new administration on the principles of equality, mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of each other." The two men "agreed to assess the current very poor state of Russian-American relations" and to work for "constructive cooperation on a wide range of issues." Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton criticized Trump over his praise of Putin during the campaign. She and other Trump critics pointed to a U.S. intelligence assessment that Russian interests were behind the hackings of Democrat Party members and may have tried to influence the U.S. elections. Putin denied the allegations. Trump also expressed skepticism, and said the United States should seek better relations with Putin and Russia. The Kremlin said that Putin and Trump "agreed to continue contacts on the phone and in the future to provide for a personal meeting." The Trump team said that he "noted to President Putin that he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia." 
November 17, 2016	USA TODAY	Donald Trump and aides say the presidential transition team is on track and plans to make major announcements soon. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the transition chairman, are taking a "structured" and "methodical" approach to putting together a presidential administration, spokesman Jason Miller said, and "we're not going to rush" the process.  "We're going to make sure that they're people that we are confident will pass confirmation and they're going to be people that we think can implement the president-elect's vision," Miller said. "Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions," Trump said on social media. "I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!" On a day of meetings at Trump Tower, Trump heard from one of his critics: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said he had a "candid" meeting with the president-elect about his concerns. They included proposed tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy, stepped-up deportation plans, support for "stop-and-frisk" police policies and a possible registry of Muslim migrants, said de Blasio, who pledged to be "open-minded" but "vigilant" about the Trump presidency. Top aides have drifted in and out of Trump Tower in the week since Trump's election, many of them potential appointees. Among them: Ex-New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is up for secretary of State; Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a possible attorney general or Defense secretary; retired general Michael Flynn, being discussed for the Pentagon as well as national security adviser; and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, a former Republican primary rival of Trump's who is being talked about for attorney general. Cruz declined to address speculation about his future, saying, "I look forward to working very closely with the president-elect, the vice president-elect to repeal Obamacare and to confirm a strong conservative Supreme Court justice to protect the rights of all Americans." As part of a tweet storm Wednesday, Trump cited some of the nations whose foreign leaders have spoken with him since the election. His list: Russia, the United Kingdom, China, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The transition team put out a list of 29 world leaders who have spoken with Trump or Pence since last week's election.
May 11, 2016	USA TODAY	Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton in West Virginia's Democratic primary Tuesday, while Donald Trump, with no remaining challengers, claimed an easy victory there and in Nebraska among Republicans. At a rally in Salem, Ore., following his win, Sanders, a Vermont senator, told supporters "it appears that we won a big, big victory in West Virginia." "West Virginia is a working-class state, and like many other states in this country, including Oregon, working people are hurting," he said. "And what the people of West Virginia said tonight, and I believe the people of Oregon and Kentucky will say next week, is that we need an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent."  Oregon and Kentucky each hold Democratic primaries next Tuesday. Given the Democratic Party's proportional allocation system, Sanders stood to only modestly boost his delegate total with his West Virginia win. While Clinton's loss will probably matter little in her battle with Sanders given her large overall delegate lead, it is a powerful reminder of her challenges in a general election match-up with Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. West Virginia has a large number of working-class white voters, the demographic Trump hopes will carry him to victory in Rust Belt states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio in November. Clinton's performance in West Virginia -- a state she won by a wide margin in the 2008 primaries -- could point to problems with a voting bloc that supported her husband during the more economically prosperous 1990s. These same voters feel left behind as manufacturing jobs have disappeared, and the coal industry has declined amid a shift to cleaner sources of energy. Trump vows to bring coal and manufacturing jobs back to depressed pockets of Appalachia by slapping tariffs on China and reworking trade deals. Alternatively, Clinton's vision is to move these communities to a new generation of jobs, acknowledging a coal industry renaissance is not in the cards. In a speech at southeastern Ohio brewery last week, Clinton said coal is still a part of the nation's energy supply, but even big coal-consuming nations such as China are starting to burn less. It's not a message West Virginians seem to want to hear. Trump leads Clinton by 27 percentage points in West Virginia, according to a recent Public Policy Polling survey. Along with his performance in West Virginia with white, working-class voters, he's picking up steam in more critical Midwestern swing states that Clinton has to carry in November. Democrats have assumed Clinton would beat Trump in states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan, which voted twice for Barack Obama and are populated by the blue-collar, union households that have been the Democratic Party's lifeblood for generations. Yet a new Quinnipiac University Swing State Poll shows Clinton and Trump in a dead heat in two of them: Ohio and Pennsylvania. Clinton is trying to cast Trump as a fraud whose rhetoric about helping lower-income Americans does not match his policies. On Tuesday in Louisville, she said Trump "actually stood on a debate stage and argued that Americans are paid too much, not too little." In West Virginia, Clinton suffered from her association with Obama, whose policies have accelerated the nation's shift to greener sources of energy without providing a safety net for workers dependent on the coal industry, according to Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat who represents the state. "It's been very harmful to the Democratic Party in West Virginia," Manchin said during a recent Clinton campaign stop in Charleston. Meanwhile, Trump for the first time faced a cleared field in GOP primaries in West Virginia and Nebraska (Democrats held a caucus there in March) after Ted Cruz and John Kasich ended their campaigns last week. 
December 12, 2016	USA TODAY	Donald Trump says it's "ridiculous" to believe Moscow helped him win the presidency, and he rejects intelligence findings that Russia intervened in the U.S. election. "I think it's just another excuse," Trump said in an interview aired on Fox News Sunday. "I don't believe it. ... Every week it's another excuse." During the interview, Trump also appeared to reject the idea of setting up a blind trust to manage his assets during his presidency, saying that his "executives" and his children would run his companies in his absence.  Democrats and some Republicans have called for hearings and investigations into the CIA's conclusion that Russia authorized hacking and other tactics in order to help Trump and hurt Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton during the campaign. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., issued a joint statement Sunday with incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., calling for a bipartisan effort to explore the allegations and defend the nation against cyberattacks. The two were joined by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. and Sen, Jack Reed, D-R.I., the bipartisan leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee. "For years, foreign adversaries have directed cyberattacks at America's physical, economic, and military infrastructure, while stealing our intellectual property," their statement said. "Now our democratic institutions have been targeted. Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American." In his Fox interview, Trump said Democrats are pushing the idea of Russian involvement in an effort to explain their surprise election loss. He also said there's no way to know if Russia was behind the hacking of e-mail accounts belonging to Democratic and Clinton campaign officials. "Once they hack if you don't catch them in the act you're not going to catch them," Trump said. "They have no idea if it's Russia or China or somebody." Russia is believed to be a topic of presidential intelligence briefings, though Trump does not receive them every day. He told Fox News Sunday that he receives the briefing "when I need it," because it tends to the same information day-to-day. "I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years," Trump said, noting that Vice President-elect Mike Pence is receiving frequent briefings. Trump told Fox that "very good people" do the briefings, and he has told them: "'If something should change from this point, immediately call me. I'm available on one-minute's notice.'" Executives and his children will run his various companies. The New York City businessman said liquidating his assets and placing the proceeds in a blind trust would be impractical and time-consuming because so much his business involves real estate. "You know, when you sell real estate that's not like going out and selling a stock," Trump said. "That takes a long time." Said Trump: "My executives will run it with my children. It's a big company, it's a great company. But I'm going to have nothing to do with management." Trump dismissed suggestions that foreign governments and others would try to buy influence by buying into Trump products, such as staying at his new hotel in downtown Washington, D.C. His focus is on being president, Trump said, and he has rejected business deals in the wake of his political campaign. "I turned down seven deals with one big player, great player, last week, because I thought it could be perceived as a conflict of interest," Trump said. "Look, I'm somebody that gets it and nobody really knows," Trump said. "It's not something that's so hard and fast." While he is "studying" the Paris climate change agreement with other countries, Trump indicated he would restart the Keystone and the Dakota Access pipelines after he takes office Jan. 20. The Obama administration blocked both pipelines. Aides have identified ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as a leading candidate for the State Department post. Asked about Tillerson, Trump said that he's "much more than a business executive," and knows government officials around the world. "He knows many of the players, and he knows them well," Trump said. "He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company -- not for himself -- for the company." Trump took to Twitter on Sunday morning to say he has not made a final decision: "Whether I choose him or not for 'State'- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned!" Taiwan's president called him to congratulate him, and that it would have been "disrespectful" to have turned down the offer. Given China's objections to the call, Trump suggested he is not necessarily bound by the decades-old "one China" policy in which the U.S. recognizes only the government of mainland China. "I don't know why we have to be bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade," Trump said. 
May 19, 2016	USA TODAY	Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he was open to the idea of holding nuclear talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a move that would signal a sharp shift in American diplomatic policy toward the isolated Asian country.  "I would speak to him. I would have no problem speaking to him," Trump said. The presumptive GOP nominee also said he would put pressure on China, one of the few nations to support Pyongyang economically and financially, to try to stop North Korea's nuclear program. "China can solve that problem with one meeting or one phone call," Trump said. He made the comments during an interview Tuesday with the Reuters news agency in his office at Trump Tower in New York. He did not elaborate on whether he would propose bilateral talks with delegations from the United States and North Korea or a meeting between two leaders. Senior officials in President Obama's administration are in touch with their counterparts in North Korea, but there is no contact at the presidential level. No serving U.S. president has ever met with a North Korean leader, although Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton met with predecessors of Kim Jong Un after they left office. North Korea held nuclear tests in 2006, 2009, 2013 and 2016, according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a global security organization. Those tests have led to a series of sanctions by the United Nations. Jake Sullivan, an adviser to Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, pounced on Trump's remarks. "Let me get this straight," Sullivan said. "Donald Trump insults the leader of our closest ally, then turns around and says he'd love to talk to Kim Jong Un?" Sullivan was referring to Trump's recent feud with British Prime Minister David Cameron, who has refused to back down from calling Trump's proposed Muslim ban "divisive, stupid and wrong." Trump hit back at Cameron this week, saying it "looks like we're not going to have a very good relationship." 
December 29, 2016	USA TODAY	When it came to dominating the headlines, a presidential election and corporate scandals garnered the most interest during 2016. Although the year had its share of mergers, acquisitions, new regulations and the usual corporate winners and losers, it will probably be best remembered for the prospect of government policy changes that could deeply affect Americans for years. Here is our list of the year's biggest stories. New presidents always portend massive changes. But the election of Trump, with his promises to upend Washington and roll back regulations, could shake business and economic establishments to their foundations. While he has hinted at keeping some popular provisions of Obamacare, Trump will be politically pressured to repeal much of the health care law that mandated universal coverage. Having promised to bring jobs back to Rust Belt states, Trump is likely to renegotiate trade deals and possibly even raise tariffs, a move that could trigger global disputes. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted after the national financial crisis to lower excessive risk-taking by banks, could be under assault as lobbyists push for easing its restrictions. Trump has professed a desire to maintain the current low-interest-rate policy.  In late June, the United Kingdom defied polling forecasts and voted to leave the European Union, setting off reverberations around the globe. U.S. stocks fell 5% as fears spread of disrupted trade relationships with Europe and of other countries that could follow the U.K.'s lead. Yet the market recovered within days as investors realized the immediate effects on American businesses were limited. There were even some winners among U.S. banks and tech firms that may have gained from a shift in investment from the U.K. But the economic fallout won't really be clear until the U.K. renegotiates trade deals with European countries before it leaves the EU in 2019. Wall Street stumbled into 2016, with stocks suffering their worst-ever first week of trading. But the gloom gave way to bullish optimism, especially after the presidential election when the "Trump rally" put the 120-year-old Dow Jones industrial average on a track for a "Dow 20,000" milestone, racking up more than 25 record highs in 2016  along the way. The stock rebound occurred despite the Federal Reserve's decision to hike short-term interest rates for the first time in 2016  at its December meeting -- when the central bank also let investors know it expects three more rate increases in 2017. The rising cost of prescription drug prices captured headlines, generated rising criticism and sparked investigations. At center stage was Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli's decision to impose a more than 5,000% price spike of a drug used to treat a parasitic illness suffered by AIDS patients. Summoned to appear before a congressional committee in February, he went silent, invoking his Fifth Amendment right to avoid testifying against himself. But he unloaded after the hearing, calling members of Congress "imbeciles" in a tweet. Turing wasn't the only drugmaker taking fire. Health care providers, patients and others criticized Mylan for a series of increases that raised the price for a two-pack of EpiPens, a potentially life-saving injection for allergy sufferers, to $600, up from about $100 in 2009. By year's end, Mylan had introduced a generic version of the medication for $300 per two-pack. All of these events drew fire from a Senate committee report in December that warned "staggering" increases in the cost of some prescription drugs threaten the health of patients and "the economic stability of American households." In September, the San Francisco-based bank agreed to a $185 million settlement with federal regulators after an investigation showed Wells Fargo had secretly opened millions of unauthorized deposit and credit card accounts that weren't authorized by customers. An estimated 5,300 employees were fired over several years for pressuring customers to accept the largely unwanted accounts, the bank acknowledged in its settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Los Angeles city and county legal officials.  Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf resigned in October, but investigations of the bank's conduct continued. The unemployment rate, which hit 10% in 2009, continued its remarkable descent, falling to 4.6% in November from 5% early in the year. Many economists believe that rate, the lowest since August 2007, represents full employment and can't fall much further without generating a run-up in inflation as wages rise. The Federal Reserve is coming around to that view and so, at a mid-December meeting, unexpectedly forecast three interest rate hikes in 2017, throwing cold water on the post-election market rally. The low jobless rate is already pushing up pay increases as employers compete for fewer available workers. That smaller pool of workers is also tempering average monthly job gains, which have fallen from 229,000 in 2015 to 180,000 this year. They fell below $27 per barrel in mid-February as a global glut of production fueled a surplus and concerns about economic growth dealt a blow. The commodity's sharp descent, dropping nearly in half over a four-month stretch, contributed to bankruptcies of dozens of U.S. energy companies and thousands of layoffs. But oil rebounded to more than $50 per barrel after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and certain non-OPEC states, including Russia, agreed in November to slash production in a bid to bolster prices. The greenback hit its highest level vs. the euro in 14 years as global investors began pricing in less Fed stimulus and stronger U.S. growth. The dollar surged in value against currencies around the world following the election of Trump. It showed particular strength against the Chinese yuan, which Trump repeatedly targeted in his campaign after accusing the Chinese government of currency manipulation to benefit its economy. A decades-long movement toward free trade and globalization appeared to stop in its tracks as presidential candidates  Trump and Hillary Clinton both vowed to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have relaxed trade restrictions with Asian nations. Trump threatened to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement if Mexico doesn't renegotiate the deal and to slap Mexico and China with tariffs of 35% and 45%, respectively. His aim: to partly reverse the millions of layoffs at U.S. factories as jobs were offshored to China, Mexico and other countries. But many economists say those jobs aren't coming back and tariffs risk retaliation that could ravage U.S. exports and jobs. Fake news bubbled up during the political campaign and became a business issue for the place where many people get their news: Facebook. A post-election analysis by BuzzFeed found that fake stories shared on Facebook outperformed real news stories during the final three months of the campaign cycle. The most shared story was a fake report about Pope Francis' endorsement of then-Republican nominee  Trump. Facebook CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg said it was "extremely unlikely" that it affected the election outcome, but the company is making changes so users of the social network can more easily flag news that is fake. A Pew Research Center survey, released this month, found that 63% say fake news creates "great confusion" among the public about current events.
December 15, 2016	USA TODAY	The moment Donald Trump was declared winner of the presidential election Nov. 8, Wall Street's script for where financial markets were headed in the new year underwent a major rewrite.  Stale 2017 market outlooks were torn up and  more bullish forecasts drawn up. Indeed, the arrival of business-friendly Trump, coupled with a Republican sweep of Congress, added up to a bullish change agent the four Wall Street pros who took part in USA TODAY's 21st annual Investment Roundtable weren't necessarily expecting -- but which they now view as a mostly positive development for a U.S. stock market that has been in bull-market mode for nearly eight years.  "Trump's election is a game-changer," said Roundtable panelist David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs. The well-respected big-picture strategist, who hails from the same firm where several of Trump's cabinet picks and advisors have worked, expects the so-called "Trump Rally" to extend into the new year. His call is for the broad Standard & Poor's 500 stock index to climb as high as 2,400, or nearly 6.5% higher by the end of March. But he sees the market giving back and finishing 2017 at 2,300 (or +2%) as the reality of what Trump can get passed through Congress "tempers"  post-election market euphoria. Rupal Bhansali, chief investment officer of international and global equities at Ariel Investments, summed up the 180-degree political and economic shift this way: "What we are essentially witnessing," the Roundtable panelist and five-star fund manager said, "is a regime change. We had Reaganomics in the 1980s. We have Abenomics in Japan. Now we have Trumponomics." Trump's platform is seen propelling the domestic economy to a faster growth rate and providing a boost to corporate earnings growth,  fuel that drives the stock market. The general outline of his plan, namely to slash the corporate tax rate to as low as 15% from 35%, do away with regulations  businesses' complain makes it difficult for them to grow, and spend $1 trillion over 10 years to rebuild the nation's infrastructure over 10 years is viewed as a template for growth. "I am more optimistic," acknowledges Roundtable panelist Jeff Rottinghaus, manager of the five-star T. Rowe Price Large Cap Core Fund, adding Trump's policy platform is "very positive" for the financial picture of America. Gavin Baker, manager of the five-star Fidelity OTC Fund, who says his investment focus is more about identifying the next great innovation in tech and profiting from it and less about forecasting market outcomes, says the financial math does add up for many stocks and sectors that could benefit from Trump's call for lower taxes and fewer regulations. "It's reasonably clear that with single-party control in Washington, D.C. that we are going to get tax reform and regulatory reform," Baker said. "So if you are a domestically focused U.S. company with a tax rate that goes from, say, 40%, down to 25% (under Trump), that means your after-tax earnings go from 60% to 75%, which is a 25% increase in your company's earnings per share. That is real fundamental change. Similarly, if there is regulatory change that results in banks having to hold less capital, that (improves) their return profile." Still, there are potential headwinds. For one, Wall Street has yet to get many specifics on what kind of tax relief Trump will be able to push through for U.S. companies. Nor do investors know what regulations will be eliminated, or how much Congress will approve in terms of dollars to be spent on infrastructure, or what lawmakers will decide on how much to tax U.S. companies for profits sitting overseas and how that might motivate CEOs to repatriate some of that cash and bring it back to America. Trump could also upset markets by starting trade wars with trading partners such as China and Mexico, as well as slapping tarrifs on incoming goods to the U.S. There's a strong chance Trump won't get everything he wants -- nor will Wall Street. Then there's the Federal Reserve, which on Wednesday hiked short-term interest rates a quarter of a percentage point for the first time in 2016. "The Fed is an enormous driver," Baker says. Still, at least one Roundtable panelist is betting on the end of political gridlock under one-party Republican rule. "A lack of gridlock means a few things can move forward," Kostin says. "It's like being in a traffic jam around Trump Tower in New York. When the barriers come down the cars can move." 
March 11, 2016	USA TODAY	Controversial front-runner Donald Trump said he's attracting people who are "voting out of love," even as he finds himself defending new accusations of violence among his supporters and facing criticism for praising authoritarian leaders. "We're taking people from the Democrat Party. We're taking people as independents, and they're all coming out and the whole world is talking about it. It's very exciting," he said at the start of a debate in Miami that was largely a civil affair but for a couple of minor exceptions. "The Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what's happening. ... Be smart and unify."  Trump was looking to Thursday's debate to anchor his lead in the GOP presidential race, while opponents Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich hoped to improve their position or simply survive. Do-or-die pressure is building for the four remaining candidates. This was the 12th debate -- and it was originally slated to be the last. But as full-blown resistance to a Trump nomination has broken out in some quarters of the party, GOP officials added another one, in Utah on March 21, when half of the delegates to national convention will have been awarded. Trump has been the target of intense attacks during the last two debates, including by Rubio, who mocked the New York businessman for the size of his hands and, with innuendo, about other parts of his anatomy. But Rubio expressed regret this week for the nature of some of his remarks. Republican analysts believe the trash-talking insults hurt Rubio, a Florida U.S. senator, as much as Trump, and contributed to Rubio's failure to win any state in the "Super Tuesday 2" primaries earlier this week. CNN moderator Jake Tapper called for a "serious" debate, and the candidates did lower the volume. Without the shouting, spectators could hear their thoughts on immigration, trade, jobs, education, Israel, counterterrorism, and Social Security, a big issue in Florida. Trump pledged to turn around the problem of decreasing worker wages, saying, "I think that's why there has been such an outpouring of love to what I'm saying." But he was confronted during the debate for inciting violence at his rallies, by saying he wanted to punch a protester in the face and for telling the crowd to "knock the crap out of" another protester. On Wednesday, police in Fayetteville, N.C., arrested a 78-year-old man for punching a protester in the face as he was being escorted out of a Trump rally. "I certainly do not condone that at all," Trump said. But then he added: "We have some protesters who are bad dudes. ... They are really dangerous. They get in there and they start hitting people." Cruz, when asked if such scenes hurt the GOP for general election, said: "For every one of us, we need to show respect for the people. We need to remember who it is we're working for." Rubio was smoother and more subdued in the past, but called out the fire-tongued Trump for his controversial rhetoric. "The problem is presidents can't just say anything they want. It has consequences here and around the world," Rubio said. Trump, who has been accused of praising authoritarianism, said he thinks Russia's Vladimir Putin is "a strong leader," and China has a strong government, but that doesn't mean he endorses what they do. All the candidates supported the idea of sending in American troops to fight the Islamic State if military leaders recommended it, with Trump citing numbers of up to 20,000 to 30,000. Just before the event began, Republican Party chairman Reince Priebus addressed the crowd, saying he wanted to clear up something: The party will support the eventual nominee -- "whoever that is" -- 100%.
December 22, 2016	USA TODAY	After meetings with the CEOs of Boeing and Lockheed Martin on Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump said he and the aircraft makers will work to try to reduce costs on major defense projects, including a new Air Force One. "We're just beginning -- it's a dance," Trump told reporters following a series of conferences at his golf resort in Palm Beach, Fla. "It's a little bit of a dance. But we're going to get the costs down, and we're going to get it done beautifully."  One of his guests, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, told reporters his company would cut the $4billion estimate of a new Air Force One, a price tag that had raised the president-elect's ire. "We work on Air Force One because it's important to our country," he said, "and we're going to make sure that he gets the best capability and that it's done affordably." Trump met with defense contractors on a day in which aides released a schedule of inaugural events next month and as he sought to push back on critics who emphasize his loss of the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by saying he aimed for a win in the Electoral College all along. "Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote," the president-elect tweeted. "Hillary focused on the wrong states!" Trump's meetings with the CEOs of Boeing and Lockheed Martin came just weeks after he criticized the size of government contracts they hold for the new Air Force One and F-35 joint strike fighter, respectively. While the president-elect has threatened to cancel a Boeing contract for a new Air Force One, military officials say the presidential plane needs an upgrade, including enhanced (and expensive) security equipment. In a tweet earlier this month, Trump said that "the F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th." Trump said his meetings Wednesday dealt mostly with the F-35, saying that "we're trying to get costs down." The president-elect also spoke with members of the Air Force leadership, one of whom could be seen carrying a binder with a photo of Air Force One on the cover. Speaking with reporters, Muilenburg said that "we're all focused on the same thing here, we're going to make sure that we give our war fighters the best capability in the world and that we do it in a way that is affordable for our taxpayers." Appointed businessman and investor Carl Icahn as "special adviser" on issues related to streamlining federal regulations. In a statement, Trump called Icahn "not only a brilliant negotiator, but also someone who is innately able to predict the future especially having to do with finances and economies." Announced that economist Peter Navarro would be the new director of Trade and Industrial Policy, working to correct what the president-elect has called unfair trade agreements with other nations. Navarro will lead the newly created White House National Trade Council. Noting that he read one of Navarro's books "years ago," the president-elect said that "he has presciently documented the harms inflicted by globalism on American workers, and laid out a path forward to restore our middle class. He will fulfill an essential role in my administration as a trade adviser." Spoke with reporters briefly and condemned the recent violence in Germany and Turkey, saying that "what's going on is terrible." Asked specifically about the terrorist attack in Berlin on Monday that left at least nine people dead, Trump called the assault on a Christmas market by a man driving a truck an "attack on humanity, and it's got to be stopped." Clinton, the Democratic candidate, won more than 65.8 million votes in the election, some 2.8 million more than Trump -- but Trump won more states, cruising to victory in the Electoral College. "I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote -- but would campaign differently," Trump said during his brief tweet storm. He added: "I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss!" 
January 3, 2017	USA TODAY	Closer relations with democratic Taiwan. Unflinching support for Israel. A pledge to restore America's atrophied military power. Deregulation and tax cuts that have already sent the stock market soaring. A Cabinet with key slots assigned to individuals of impeccable integrity. The record of this interregnum is enough to give a determined conservative #NeverTrumper like myself pause. Was I wrong? Will America not only avert disaster but enjoy an unexpected renaissance? Is this rough orange beast slouching toward the White House the second coming of Ronald Reagan?  If so, having denounced Trump in op-ed after tweet after op-ed, I will be  embarrassed. Worse, I also slammed his supporters for willful blindness at best and moral turpitude at worst, quite a few of them by name. If they turn out to be right, and I have made a monumental misassessment of President-elect Donald Trump, I will be deservedly dining on crow for the rest of my life. However, I have not yet quite reached the point of repentance. Rather, as I look around at the emerging Trump administration, if I am not feeling vindication, I am perceiving something else. First, Trump is in the honeymoon phase that is part of our democratic tradition. He is America's next president, and even his harshest critics want him to succeed, to make the country prosperous and to keep it secure. In some quarters, expectations have been so low that we are  astonished when he exceeds them. To be sure, exceeding them has not happened with great frequency. But Trump is also benefiting from something else. Reflecting the bitter divisions of the campaign, Trump's transition is turning out to be one of the nastiest honeymoons in the history of marriage. Yet some of the nastiness directed at the groom is working to his advantage. Trump and his entourage have been subjected to relentless salvos of over-the-top criticism -- which are discrediting his detractors and building support for their target. An anti-Trumper abusing Ivanka in front of her children on a JetBlue flight is part of a larger pattern. At the same time, the outgoing administration of President Obama is failing so abjectly in core duties that one wonders whether, under incoming President Trump, things could possibly get worse. The fall of Aleppo, Syria, has illuminated a grim and seemingly endless landscape of national security failure. We are witnessing human suffering on a grand scale while simultaneously enduring strategic defeats, with Russia and Iran making headway in the Middle East and a refugee crisis in Europe merging with a terrorism crisis to jeopardize the post-war European liberal order. Obama's foreign policy legacy is so appalling -- and Obama and his apologists are so blithe about what they have wrought, while also stopping to shaft Israel at the United Nations on their way out -- that it fosters the impression  Trump can only do better. The reality is Trump can do worse. All the signs of trouble that were present across his career and during the campaign are present today, plus more: the conspiracy theorists whom Trump has selected as his key  national security advisers; the  tweeting about everything from a dearth of U.S. nuclear weapons, to Saturday Night Live to Vladimir Putin; the impulsive policymaking based upon whatever adviser, business partner or child has most recently entered or left the room; the cyber bullying of critics, the threats against individual companies,  the self-dealing, the incessant lying. Already, the audience for these eccentricities extends to the heads of state of allies and adversaries. Soon, as Trump gains the power to move aircraft carriers, dispatch the Marines or make nuclear threats, their impact will be magnified by the  powers of the U.S. presidency. There is also the  substance of the Trump Doctrine, encapsulated in the formula "Art of the Deal." If America's relationship with the world is reduced to a balance sheet of profits and losses, how will  Taiwan fare if its security turns out to be a bargaining chip in a negotiation with China over tariffs? How will Israel fare under a president who wants to "sort of be neutral" between Israel and the Palestinians, who also wants to back Israel to the hilt, while also bringing about the "ultimate deal" between the parties? This is not strategic ambiguity; it is an incoherence replicated in Trump's approach to every trouble spot on the globe. Will this presidency end well? Even as I continue to fear the worst, I sincerely hope, for the good of the country, that I will soon be dining on crow.

June 8, 2016	USA TODAY	Improving business conditions and a U.S. stock market flirting with record highs are now trumping risks related to presidential politics. But the Clinton v. Trump campaign showdown could still cause problems for the economy and anxious moments for financial markets in coming months as the polls shift back and forth, feared policy proposals gain traction and Election Day nears. Warnings of the potential for politically driven tumult are starting to pop up on a regular basis, in terms of:  Economic growth expectations. Economists polled by the National Association for Business Economics  lowered their 2016 U.S. growth estimate to 1.8%, down from 2.2% in March. And 60% of economists cited "uncertainty surrounding the upcoming election" as a reason for dialing back their GDP outlook. Sentiment about the economy. Ethan Harris, global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a report he's concerned about a "confidence shock" between next month's national party conventions and the Nov. 9 election if "threats of tariffs and currency wars, deportation of immigrants, a large expansion of the budget deficit, and talk about the economy and markets being in a bubble" continues. Employment plans. Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at The Economic Outlook Group, went as far as theorizing the dismal May jobs report  could be due to business leaders "pulling back on hiring and investments" and "turning hyper-cautious" because of the lack of clarity surrounding the outlook for taxes, government spending, trade and foreign policy. Much of the market angst surrounds Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump, or what Baumohl refers to as "The Trumpian Effect." Trump has said he will slap tariffs on China imports to the U.S., build a wall along the Mexico-U.S. border and consider relieving Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen of her duties if he gets elected. The mere thought of a global trade war ratchets up Wall Street's angst meter. "Trump," says Greg Valliere, chief strategist at Horizon Investments, "would be the mother of all uncertainty for markets." Wall Street still believes the best outcome for investors is a Hillary Clinton win with the Republicans holding on to at least one branch of Congress, so as to avoid a Democratic sweep and complete control of Washington. For now, the market is shrugging off the political sideshow and investors are bidding stock prices higher based on improving business conditions, says Jeremy Zirin, chief equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas. A big reason for the market's relative calm is a belief Clinton will capture the White House (a PredictWise poll,  closely followed by investors, puts the odds of the Democratic candidate topping the Republican at 73%). But market volatility could start to pick up if "you start to see the gap close," which will "inject more uncertainty into the election outcome," Zirin adds. One way Trump could rise in the polls is if Clinton is hurt by a downturn in the economy,  currently under the stewardship of outgoing two-term Democratic President Barack Obama, analysts say. Valliere, who argues election risk has decreased in recent weeks due to Trump's lower odds of winning due to his "self-inflicted wounds," also believes any sign of a Trump surprise resurgence would spook markets: "If he were to pull ahead markets would have to start to worry." The reason investors' angst level would increase is that some of Trump's more market-unfriendly policies, like his protectionist leanings and plans to pick a fight with China and impose tariffs, would start to "look like they are becoming more likely," says Andy Laperriere, head of policy research at Cornerstone Macro. "That's more of a risk to markets than the candidates calling each other names." If Trump looks like he might win, investors will have to figure out how a trade war, or protectionism or anti-immigration policies might impact their investments. Similarly, a Clinton win could give investors pause, as they will likely face higher taxes on investments, as well as get more stringent regulations and oversight of key sectors such as financials and health care, Laperriere adds. Laperriere says there are two big risks that could cause coming market tumult: "A Trump win or a Democratic sweep." If either of those outcomes occur, "you could see investors taking a more conservative approach, or the average businessman saying, 'I am not going to make that marginal investment or job hire because I am not sure what the broader economic environment will look like." 
August 9, 2016	USA TODAY	Trump did tweak the dramatic tax cuts he proposed months ago. He still wants to compress the current seven personal income tax brackets to three. But the rates  have been raised to 12%, 25% and 33%, from 10%, 20% and 25%.  The change appears partly aimed at critics that say the overhaul will increase the U.S. deficit by $9.5 trillion over 10 years. But Trump also proposed a new tax credit for child care expenses that could offset any savings, says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's analytics. Trump reiterated his plan to slash the current 35% corporate tax rate to 15% and chop taxes for small businesses -- which mostly pay personal tax rates -- to 15% as well,  transforming the country from the highest-taxed nation to among the lowest. That should prompt more multinational companies to locate in the U.S. Zandi estimates all the cuts would juice the economy initially, spurring growth of 3.7% in 2017, compared to 3% under current law. "I want to jump-start America," he said in a speech on his economic plan at the Detroit Economic Club. Trump did little to explain how the tax reductions would be offset other than suggesting less taxed consumers and businesses will spend and invest more, creating a more vibrant economy. For Trump's plan to work, substantial spending cuts likely will be necessary, and the billionaire made no mention of that. As a result, both Moody's and Oxford project the plan would trigger massive deficits and sharply higher interest rates that lead to a recession. On trade, Trump wants to brand China a currency manipulator, stop the country from stealing U.S. intellectual property and force its government to no longer subsidize its exports. Previously, Trump has said he would slap China with 45% tariffs if the country doesn't change its practices  as part of an effort to close the trade gap. Tariffs on other countries' imports likely will cause them to retaliate with hefty duties on U.S. products, hammering U.S. exports and shrinking the economy. It's unlikely that low-level manufacturing jobs in sectors such as apparel that have shifted overseas will come streaming back while the country's trade policy remains uncertain, Zandi says. More likely is that the jobs will move to other low-wage countries such as Vietnam.

November 1, 2016	USA TODAY	On a recent flight to Chicago, I sat next to a very nice woman with a British-sounding accent who was from Zimbabwe but had gone to school in London. As tends to happen these days, our conversation veered into the U.S. presidential elections. "My friends in London mainly want to know if Americans have lost all their senses," she told me. She told me this as I thumbed through that week's edition of The Economist, whose cover heralded: "The debasing of American politics."  Hacked emails. Sexual assault claims. FBI investigations. Vows to jail political opponents. Corruption allegations. This election season has certainly served up a smorgasbord of reality-TV-like fodder that has stunned and dismayed many of our allies abroad. But we can learn from other nations, too. A good place to start is Britain, which is starting to feel hangover pangs from the Brexit referendum, in which 52% of voters chose for the U.K. to withdraw from the European Union. The pound is down 15% on a trade-weighted basis since the Brexit vote, according to the Economist, closing in on the depths it reached during the 2008-09 crisis and near the bottom of the 154 currencies tracked by Bloomberg. A root cause of the sterling's plunge, according to the British newspaper, is "fear that Britain is turning into a xenophobic, interventionist and unpredictable place, with calls to clamp down on foreign workers and foreign capital." Donald Trump's policy agenda up until now has been tinged with similar xenophobic and unpredictable tones, from calling for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. to promises that he'll renegotiate NAFTA, withdraw from the World Trade Organization and slap tariffs on Mexican and Chinese goods. His vows to tinker with and, in some cases, tear up trade deals have some economists most worried. Trump has said he will renegotiate many of the deals for better terms. But a recent study by the pro-trade Peterson Institute for International Economics warned that Trump's trade proposals, if enacted, could cost the U.S. more than 4 million jobs and spin the country into a recession. As president, Trump would have wide leeway to alter trade deals. In a worst-case scenario, if China and Mexico retaliate by raising tariffs on American goods, America could be facing a "full trade war," and unemployment could rocket to more than 8%, according to the Peterson study. The study's authors examined both candidates' trade policies but concluded Trump's would be far worse. "While Clinton's stated trade policy would be harmful, Trump's stated trade policy would be horribly destructive," one of its authors wrote. Plenty, according to Jennifer Hillman, a Georgetown University law professor who focuses on trade and has studied the Brexit effect. The rhetoric from supporters of Brexit -- fear of foreign workers taking local jobs -- has been nearly identical to those found in Trump's rally speeches, she told me. In a speech in North Carolina last week, Trump reiterated his threat to slap tariffs on goods made overseas by companies that have shipped jobs overseas. "At the center of my jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals," he told the crowd. But higher tariffs will not bring jobs back to the USA. More than 85% of them have been lost to automation and technology, not trade agreements, according to most studies, Hillman said. "It doesn't matter what you do with China," she said. "Are you going to get rid of every robot at the end of every assembly line? Probably not. Stopping trade isn't going to bring those jobs back." Britain, through its Brexit pains, and other European countries who embrace a nationalist, protectionist philosophy are fast discovering a pesky consequence of that thinking: It's bad for business. Of course, trade wars and Britain's currency woes are far less sexy than sexual delinquency and hacked emails and will likely get scant air time between now and the Nov. 8 elections. But if our economy is of any importance, it'll benefit voters to take a hard look at what's happening across the Atlantic before heading to the polls. 
September 28, 2016	USA TODAY	Clinton said the only tax returns anyone has seen from Trump "showed he didn't pay any federal income tax." That's not correct. Clinton: "Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax." Trump paid federal income taxes in three out of five years from 1975 to 1979, according to a report to the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, which viewed Trump's tax returns when the Trump Plaza Corp. applied for a casino license  in 1981. Although the returns were not disclosed, the report indicated that Trump paid $18,714 in taxes on $76,210 in income in 1975, $10,832 in taxes on $24,594 in income in 1976 and $42,386 in taxes on $118,530 in income in 1977. Trump reported income losses of $406,379 in 1978 and $3,443,560 in 1979, and thus paid no federal income tax for those years.  Trump claimed that Ford is moving its small-car division overseas and that, as a result, thousands of jobs are leaving Michigan and Ohio. Trump is half right. Ford is moving its small-car division to Mexico, but Ford's CEO insists not a single job will be lost in the USA. Trump: "So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small-car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore." Ford CEO Mark Fields confirmed on Sept. 16 that "over the next two to three years, we will have migrated all of our small-car production to Mexico and out of the United States," the Detroit Free Press reported. The Free Press article states that last year, "the automaker made a commitment to invest $9billion in U.S. plants and create or retain more than 8,500 jobs as part of a new four-year contract with the UAW (United Auto Workers). Of that, $4.8 billion goes to 11 facilities in Michigan." Trump left the false impression that the Obama administration failed to disclose the full amount paid to Iran in January to settle a long outstanding claim. Trump claimed $400 million paid to Iran in January "turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion." But the administration accurately described the total payment as $1.7 billion -- $400 million in principle and $1.3billion in interest -- on the day it was announced. In criticizing the Iran nuclear deal during the debate, Trump referenced the $400 million payment to Iran. Trump described the payment as being "for the hostages," because it was paid on the same day in January that Iran released U.S. prisoners. The Obama administration has insisted the United States did not pay Iran ransom for the prisoners' release. The $400 million was the first installment in a $1.7 billion payment to resolve a dispute that dates to 1979, when Iran paid the United States $400 million for military equipment it never received. The United States refused to provide the equipment after the shah of Iran was overthrown during the Iranian Revolution in 1979. The agreement ended a claim that Iran had filed against the United States in an international tribunal in The Hague. President Obama announced it Jan. 17 as part of a series of agreements involving Iran. In August, The Wall Street Journal reported new details on the payment, and the administration acknowledged that it delayed paying Iran until the prisoners were released -- fueling criticism that it was ransom. Clinton said Trump thinks "climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese." Trump denied it. He did tweet that the Chinese created the "concept of global warming" but later said it was a joke. Trump has called global warming a hoax repeatedly. On Nov. 6, 2012, Trump tweeted, "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive." On Jan. 18, Trump told Fox News, "Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax. A lot of people are making a lot of money. ... I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke. But this is done for the benefit of China, because China does not do anything to help climate change. They burn everything you could burn; they couldn't care less." Ninety-seven percent of scientists say it's "extremely likely" that human-caused global warming is real. Trump claimed without evidence that in 2008, the Clinton campaign pushed "very hard" the false story that President Obama was born in Kenya, not in Hawaii. Trump, who finally acknowledged Sept. 16 that "Obama was born in the United States," had a long, somewhat rambling response when asked by the moderator, Lester Holt of NBC News, why he continued to question that Obama was born in Hawaii even after the president produced his long-form birth certificate in 2011. Holt: "Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy. In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long?" Trump: "I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. And you can go look it up, and you can check it out. "And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She (Clinton) failed to get the birth certificate. "When I got involved, I didn't fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I'm satisfied with it. And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it." Trump: "Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country." Holt: "I will let you respond. It's important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15 ..." Trump: "Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job. "Secretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it's true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved." It is false that  Solis Doyle, Clinton's 2008 campaign manager, was involved in spreading the rumor of Obama's birthplace. Solis Doyle said -- in the CNN interview that Trump cites -- that a "rogue volunteer coordinator" in Iowa was immediately fired when the campaign found out that the aide forwarded an email promoting the birther conspiracy. Solis Doyle said she called Obama campaign manager David Plouffe and apologized for the incident. "This was not the kind of campaign we wanted to run," she said she told Plouffe. The Blumenthal case is more complicated, but it doesn't provide clear evidence that the Clinton campaign was "pressing it very hard." Blumenthal was a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton, and he remained in close contact with Hillary Clinton after she became secretary of State. Blumenthal didn't send a reporter to Kenya. McClatchy's former bureau chief James Asher said he had a meeting with Blumenthal during the 2008 campaign, and at that meeting, Blumenthal encouraged McClatchy to chase the story of Obama's birth. Blumenthal denies urging Asher to investigate Obama's birthplace, and Asher has nothing in writing -- so there is no clear evidence to support Asher's account. Trump and Clinton dueled over whether ending stop-and-frisk police stops in New York City had been accompanied by more crime and killings. Clinton said crime, including murders, is down, and Trump said, "Murders are up." Turns out, both are correct. Trump: "Stop and frisk has a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, a very, very big impact." Clinton: "It's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders." Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio was sworn in Jan. 1, 2014, after being elected on a promise to halt the stop-and-frisk practice. During his first year in office, homicides did fall -- by two -- to 333, the lowest number on record. Last year, the number of killings went up by 5.7% to 352 -- the third-lowest year on record but still 17 more than in 2013. This year, the number is down once again, but if the current rate continues, the total for the year would be slightly above where it was before De Blasio took office. According to the most recent weekly report issued by the city's police department, 257 murders had been reported in 2016 as of Sept. 18, which is 4.3% below the same period in 2015. That's slightly less than one per day, but at that rate, 2016 (a leap year with 366 days) would end up with 345 killings, 10 more than the 335 recorded in 2013. Despite the uptick in murders last year, the city did record the lowest number of major crimes on record in 2015.

November 10, 2016	USA TODAY	In his improbable race to the presidency, President-elect Donald Trump treated tech as he did much of the electorate. He trash-talked it in tweets, offering few insights on a $2.9 trillion  industry that's been in overdrive, but for which he has no discernible policy.  In 140 characters or less, he called for a boycott of Apple when it didn't cave to the FBI's request to hack the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino (Calif.) shooters. He chided Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos because, he claimed, Amazon didn't pay "fair taxes." And Trump has urged Apple and others to make hardware in the U.S. instead of China to  make "America first." But Trump has outlined  policies on trade, tax reform, immigration and jobs that could  reverberate through industry and its investors. His hard-line stance against mergers, in particular AT&T-Time Warner, could also weaken  thirst for M&A and IPOs. "We will see far less IPOs and exits in the short term as big tech companies and VCs wait and see what kind of president Trump will be," says Ben Parr, co-founder of Octane AI, a bot-creation  start-up in San Francisco. Trump has espoused tighter immigration and  boosting American workers, possibly putting a dent in the hiring plans of tech start-ups and  dissuading foreign entrepreneurs from establishing operations in the U.S. The H-1B program, a non-immigrant visa program that lets employers temporarily hire foreign workers in specialized jobs, is "threatened," says Mark Goines, vice chairman of Personal Capital, an online financial-advisory firm based in San Francisco. "If we want to keep jobs here, then we have to train engineers here," Goines says. "Trump doesn't want to impose more programs, so re-training people to become tech workers is critical to restructuring employment in America. It's not clear if you change the core rules of H-1B that it will actually benefit the American workforce." It is a sensitive topic in tech, where 51% of billion-dollar start-ups in the U.S. were founded by immigrants and 70% of their key hires are from outside the country, according to a non-partisan study on entrepreneurship from the National Foundation for American Policy. Trump's repeated promise to declare China a manipulator of currency could lead to tariffs of 45% on Chinese imports and 35% on products from Mexico, though some economists expect more modest tariffs. 
November 11, 2016	USA TODAY	President-elect Donald Trump has mocked and decried the nuclear deal the Obama administration negotiated with Iran ever since he started running for president. In September 2015, Trump said he would "renegotiate" the agreement, reached two months earlier, which curtailed Iran's nuclear program to peaceful activities in return for the lifting of crippling sanctions over time. Last month, Trump said Iran "should write us a letter of thank you" for "the stupidest deal of all time." Vice President-elect Mike Pence said the deal would be "ripped up" after consultation with U.S. allies. Yes, State Department spokesman Mark Toner confirmed. "The agreement is valid only as long as all parties uphold it," he said Wednesday. The threats from Trump and his team were enough to prompt Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to issue statements about the future of the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. It cannot be changed by one government's decision, Rouhani insisted Wednesday. "Iran exercised prudence concerning the nuclear agreement as it confirmed JCPOA as a U.N. Security Council Resolution, not as an agreement with one government," he said, according to the government-controlled Iranian Students News Agency. The nuclear deal was reached between the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China -- the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- plus Germany. All approved it. The reality is that Iran was brought to the bargaining table with the help of sanctions imposed by the United States, the U.N. Security Council and the European Union at the urging of the Obama administration and Congress. Russia, China and U.S. allies in Europe have started doing business with oil-rich Iran since the deal was inked, and they hope for more. European countries have lifted sanctions. Iran has made deals to expand its oil fields, build cars and buy dozens of aircraft from the EU's Airbus and Boeing in the USA. Russia is deploying anti-aircraft systems to Iran. The United States released its hold on tens of billions of dollars in Iranian oil revenue that had been frozen in foreign bank accounts. Iran's once depressed economy is enjoying a moderate recovery. Iran has expanded its policy of supporting Shiite militias in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon. In Iraq, the militias are battling the Islamic State, a Sunni group that both Shiite-dominated Iran and the Unitd States consider an enemy. In Syria, the militias are mostly fighting U.S.-backed anti-government rebels, and in Yemen, they're fighting the U.S.- and Saudi-backed government. Pulling out of the deal could risk exacerbating these conflicts or lifting the constraints on Iran's nuclear program when it is expanding its economy and military activities abroad. Toner said State Department officials will explain the merits of the deal to Trump's transition team, though any decision about sticking to the terms of the agreement would be up to the next administration. Secretary of State John Kerry and the Obama administration "feel very strongly the Iran deal has worked," Toner said. "It prevented Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon in a short period of time." It provided for increased and more intrusive monitoring by the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, he said. The agreement required the approval of lawmakers from every country that signed it, including the GOP-controlled U.S. Congress and the Iranian parliament. If Trump announced he would not honor the agreement, "all U.S. sanctions that have been lifted or suspended are going to be reimposed by executive order," said Mark Dubowitz,  executive director of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. 
September 8, 2016	USA TODAY	Today is two months until the presidential election. Do you know where your candidate's tax returns are? If the candidate is Donald Trump, the answer is no. He steadfastly refuses to do what every major party candidate has done in the past nine elections.  While there is no law requiring candidates to disclose their taxes, presidential contenders of both parties have understood that it is necessary to show that they have nothing to hide and are free of financial conflicts of interest. Mitt Romney released his returns in 2012, even though they exposed his foreign bank accounts and relatively low tax rate. Hillary Clinton released her returns this year, even though they disclosed the unseemly specter of her husband making millions of dollars from a for-profit university. Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, plans to release his own returns soon. But Trump claims that he should be the exception. The Republican nominee continues to insist, most recently in a Labor Day interview with ABC News, that he really, really wants to release his taxes but can't because he is being audited. This is totally bogus. Audits are in no way affected by an individual's decision to release his or her returns. They do not come with gag orders from the IRS and are not prejudiced in any way by publicity. The decision to release or not release is purely at the discretion of the person being audited. Trump's decision not to come clean inevitably raises questions about what he might be concealing. Without his tax returns, voters will have no way of knowing basic facts: how much money he makes, how much he pays in taxes, and how much he gives to charity. For someone who has never held public office and whose main qualification is his success as a businessman, these are important questions. The returns would also shed light on whether he got rich mainly by enriching others, or by manipulating the bankruptcy code and aggressively avoiding taxes. Beyond Trump's personal finances is the issue of what shady behavior might lurk in his far-flung business empire -- such as an improper $25,000 contribution from his family foundation to the attorney general of Florida, whose office was poking around at allegations of fraud at Trump University. Trump also has had to turn to some rather unconventional funding sources, including the Bank of China, in the wake of his six corporate bankruptcies. It's a good bet that tax returns would have more to say on these topics, and perhaps others. Trump asserts that his financial disclosure report provides sufficient clarity. But these forms were devised by Congress to satisfy the public's interest in transparency without requiring much specificity from the candidate. By Trump's own admission, his tax returns in most years are far thicker than his 100-page disclosure report. Voters have every right to know more about Trump's finances. They haven't gotten anything close to what they deserve. 
October 3, 2016	USA TODAY	The following are the written questions and answers from an inquiry made by the Detroit Free Press to the Trump campaign on the eve of the Republican presidential nominee's return to stump in Michigan. Scott Hagerstrom, the Trump-Pence Michigan State Campaign Director, answered the questions on behalf of Trump.  Donald Trump's opening remarks during the presidential debate specifically cited Ford -- as he has numerous times before -- as one example of a company sending U.S. jobs to Mexico. "So Ford is leaving. You see that their small car division (is) leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore," Trump said during the debate. But the company and UAW responded with "fact checks" on Twitter, saying in part Ford "is not moving jobs out of Michigan. Our agreement secures future product commitments for affected plants." What's the campaign's response to that? The U.S. has lost 850,000 jobs because of NAFTA, and our small trade surplus with Mexico in 1994 has become a gigantic trade deficit totaling over $60billion. Michigan has lost more than 1 in 4 (27.6%) manufacturing jobs -- 228,000 jobs -- to Mexico since NAFTA went into effect in 1994. That ranks Michigan as 7th in manufacturing jobs lost. In January 1994, when NAFTA was enacted, there were 197,800 motor vehicle parts manufacturing jobs in Michigan. In August 2016, there were 126,200 jobs. This represents a loss of 71,600 jobs. The number of Michigan motor vehicle manufacturing jobs lost between January 1994 and August 2016 is 116,000 jobs, or 41.5% of total jobs in January 1994. I saw from financial disclosure forms that Mr. Trump owns Ford Credit debt. Can you tell me why Mr. Trump thinks Ford is a good investment even though he disagrees with their decision for future investment in Mexico? Mr. Trump's policy is to retain manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and return as many manufacturing jobs as possible. Unlike Hillary's energy plan, which would encourage U.S. solar manufacturers to produce in China, Mr. Trump's plan will cause manufacturers, such as Ford, to invest in the U.S. and create jobs here. Does Mr. Trump have any concerns about alienating voters in southeast Michigan where there are many workers at Ford and their family and friends, who have recently benefited from the company's financial success, new hiring and hefty employee bonuses? According to Michigan Department of Labor, Michigan lost 2,532 Ford automobile jobs between 2004 and 2014 to Mexico. According to Ford's latest announcement, the new plant in Mexico would create 3,000 jobs that should go to Michiganders. Other automobile manufacturers have moved billions of dollars in auto production and supplier manufacturing to Mexico, costing jobs that should now belong to Michigan. The only thing workers are offended by is Hillary Clinton's lifelong support for terrible trade deals like NAFTA and TPP. 
January 10, 2017	USA TODAY	Kellyanne Conway, one of Donald Trump's top advisers, questioned on Monday whether additional investigations are needed into reports of Russian hacking during the campaign and indicated the incoming president may reconsider some of the punitive actions President Obama ordered in response. "I predict that President Trump will want to make sure that our actions are proportionate to what occurred, based on what we know," she told Capital Download.  She said the steps Obama took, including ejecting 35 alleged Russian spies, were harsher than those he ordered after reported hacking by China and North Korea and suggested the reason for the difference was political. Conway ridiculed a proposal by House and Senate Democrats on Monday to establish a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate the allegations against Russia. U.S. intelligence agencies reported last week that Moscow, under the direction of President Vladimir Putin, hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, then leaked them in an effort to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton and elect Trump. Trump has supported investigations by the House and Senate. "It's curious and a little bit humorous that Democrats would talk about anything bipartisan ... given how they have vowed to obstruct everything we do," she said. There already was "a great deal of information out there" about the hacking, she said. "I do find it to be very ironic that the uptick and the hue-and-cry of 'investigation' and 'information' has occurred after the election results are in. ... The fact is, the Democrats became super-duper interested in this entire issue after the election did not go the way they, quote, wanted and the way they expected." Republicans also have raised concerns about Russia's actions. Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have called for the imposition of tougher sanctions. Conway, 49, was campaign manager last year for candidate Trump. She became the first woman to run a winning presidential bid and is slated to be a senior White House adviser for President Trump after he is inaugurated Jan. 20. A veteran Republican pollster and strategist, she has emerged as one of Trump's most combative and public defenders. She spoke with USA TODAY's video newsmaker series at the beginning of a crucial week. Obama is scheduled to deliver a farewell address in Chicago on Tuesday. Trump is slated to hold his first news conference as president-elect Wednesday. The Senate plans confirmation hearings for as many as nine of his Cabinet appointees this week, including attorney general-designate Jeff Sessions and secretary of State-designate Rex Tillerson. Conway said she had "hardly thought about" the Women's March on Washington, which is likely to draw thousands of protesters to the National Mall the day after Trump is sworn in. "Every single issue and criticism was fully vetted and explored many times over in this election," she said. Though she said she respected their right to protest, "I would like them to reconsider and perhaps just try to sit down and figure out how to work with their president and their vice president, because he is their president and their vice president, no matter what their hashtags say." In discussing the outgoing president, Conway said she "absolutely" would watch Obama's farewell address in Chicago on Tuesday -- but she gave what sounded like a warning. "It's a great idea for him to do this because he knows that a great deal of what he did is not going to survive this next presidency, or maybe even this next month, in some cases," she said. "You build a legacy not just by checking a box and passing legislation without a single vote from the other side. Legacies have to be sustained over time; they have to endure." She questioned whether Obama, once he leaves the Oval Office, should lead Democrats in critiquing his successor. "It's appropriate for any past president to weigh in as they feel comfortable and as appropriate," she said, then added, "I do recall that President George W. Bush gave a great deal of latitude and courtesy to President Obama and basically said, 'I'm not the president anymore; give him his chance to run the country.' We'd like the same." 
June 8, 2016	USA TODAY	That's the question investors of all kinds  are asking now that Trump and Clinton are the presumptive nominees. The answer, according to some of the nation's top market experts: President Clinton. And, the reason can be summed up in two words: trade war. "Since she would take a less hostile position toward our trading partners, particularly China and Mexico, her administration could focus more on growth than protectionism," says Sam Stovall, managing director of S&P Global Market Intelligence.  "I believe the market would fare better under Clinton, in part, because we don't know enough about a Trump administration and the potential adverse consequences of trade wars," says Bob Doll, senior portfolio manager at Nuveen Asset Management. "From the financial markets' standpoint, the choice between Clinton and Trump is really a choice between the lesser of two evils," says Bob Johnson, president and CEO of the American College of Financial Services. Still, Johnson says, there is little doubt that market participants would rather see a Clinton presidency. "Market participants believe they know more about her positions and that a Clinton presidency wouldn't represent a radical departure from the current regime," Johnson says. "There is a time-worn adage -- 'the markets dislike uncertainty,' and Trump epitomizes uncertainty. There hasn't been a more potentially disruptive candidate than Trump in recent memory." Johnson recited some of the uncertainty that comes with Trump: "Trump has advocated some outlandish positions, including suggesting that the U.S. might be able to 'renegotiate' terms of the debt -- essentially paying creditors less than 100 cents on the dollar," he says. "He's said he would repeal trade deals, deport Mexicans and punish corporations that move outside the U.S. All of these actions would destabilize the financial markets." A Clinton presidency would likely be good news for gun and ammo manufacturers, renewable energy companies and consumer staples, experts say. "It may seem ironic that gun and ammo manufacturers would cheer a Clinton victory (and they would likely do so privately), but the fear of gun-control measures would be good for (them)," Johnson says. Wind power and solar companies likely would do well under Clinton "as there would likely be even more tax incentives for renewable energy," he says. Income could rise for lower middle-class Americans with a President Clinton, and that would be good for consumer staples. "If Clinton would be able to champion an increase in the minimum wage, there would be more money in the pockets of lower-middle-class consumers," Johnson says. For his part, Stovall says managed care companies (HMOs) should benefit from the continued promotion of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). And Doll says health care services would fare better than health care products. One sector likely to be hurt: "Restaurants could be adversely affected by the Democrats' desire to push for a hike in the minimum wage to $15 per hour," Stovall says. According to Johnson, winners likely would be traditional energy companies, sectors such as fast-food restaurants that rely on minimum-wage labor and large pharmaceutical firms. Johnson also says traditional energy companies such as coal, natural gas and oil companies likely would find a more favorable regulatory environment under a President Trump. Others share that opinion. Meanwhile, Johnson says, "large pharmaceutical firms would breathe a big sigh of relief if Trump won, as Clinton has been very outspoken about price gouging by pharmaceutical firms." And, perhaps not surprisingly, "health care facilities, ... also known as hospital management companies, would most likely be hurt due to (Trump's) promise to undo the ACA," says Stovall.

January 20, 2017	USA TODAY	The emotions are complex driving hundreds of thousands of women, many first-time activists arriving on Greyhound buses from as far away as Miami and Baton Rouge, to march on Washington the day after Donald Trump's inauguration. But it starts with this: It's still better to be a man in America, and sexism remains a problem in society. That's according to the first major survey on gender since the November election, by the non-partisan research firm PerryUndem, finding a majority of women feel this way.  There's broad public consensus among both genders that work remains to be done in securing women's rights, including equal pay and paid family leave; yet the male Republican voters who elected Trump -- and who'll now hold the reins of power in Washington -- are the least likely to see sexism, violence against women, unequal care-giving responsibilities, racism, access to abortion and birth control as contributors to inequality, the survey found. Trump's Cabinet so far is 90% male and 90% white. "The State of the Union on Gender Equality, Sexism and Women's Rights," helps explain why so many Americans have chosen this moment in history to demonstrate. While men will participate in the Saturday march, according to the bus and train platform Wanderu, 81% of travelers to Washington  are women. The single biggest contributor to this peaking civic participation is the president-elect's comments and past behavior toward women, according to the survey. It ranks negative feelings about his actions as more predictive of getting politically involved than ideology, age, gender, race, education and geography. "That's a pretty big finding and pretty much explains how the women's march organically arose and is happening now," said Tresa Undem, the lead pollster. The survey of 1,302 adults was conducted Dec. 9-27. Forty-three percent of participants voted for Trump and 46% for Hillary Clinton. It is no surprise that the Women's March has adopted Clinton's 1995 declaration in Beijing as its battle cry: "Women's rights are human rights." "It's not just Hillary didn't win. It's wow, there's real potential here for us to lose some things we've worked for," said Jean Harris, an expert in feminist history at the University of Scranton. "What we are saying is that we cannot and will not be ignored," said Janaye Ingram, logistics director for the march. As a result of Trump's win, two-thirds of survey participants say they're doing things differently, including six in 10 who say they're either paying more attention to elected officials' actions, donating to an organization or getting involved in a direct political action in response to the election. Thirty-two percent feel less tolerant of perceived sexism in their own lives. The good news is there's broad agreement -- 83% -- that it's important that Trump and Congress work to move forward on issues around women's rights. The challenge this group faces is that the incoming administration is the least likely to perceive gender inequality, the survey found. The problem is connecting action to policy. "If Republican leadership in the new administration and Congress reflect Republican men in the population, they may not see connections between several policy issues and gender equality," the report said. Fewer than half of Republican men saw sexism, violence against women, unequal care giving responsibilities, racism, access to abortion and birth control as factors. Only one in four Republican men said lack of women in political office affects women's rights and equality. Of male Trump voters, 32% said in general men make better political leaders and 38% disagree that the country would be better off with more women in political office. It is in this context that the survey broached the issue that was just below the surface for much of the 2016 election. One in three respondents said they think sexism prevented Clinton from winning, while one in four saw or heard friends or family members make sexist comments about her during the campaign. Further, one-third of men and women who voted for Trump disagree that the country would be better off with more women in political office. 
January 24, 2017	USA TODAY	President Trump on Monday pledged to cut regulations by 75% and impose a major "border tax" on goods manufactured abroad and sold in the United States. Echoing his campaign rhetoric, Trump told business leaders in a breakfast meeting at the White House that businesses spend more time on paperwork complying with government regulations than on making things.  "We want to start making our products again," Trump said. "If you look at some of the original great people that ran this country, you will see they felt very strongly about that." He said the border tax would help discourage companies from firing people in the U.S., making products overseas and then moving them back into the country to sell. The president said other countries "charge a lot of tax" when American companies try to sell their products there, and he identified China by name. "You want to sell something into China, it's very, very hard, in some cases it's impossible," Trump said. "So I don't call that free trade. What we want is fair trade,  and we're going to treat other countries fairly, but they have to treat us fairly." The meeting included chief executives from a dozen companies, including Ford, Johnson & Johnson, Lockheed Martin and Dell. Andrew Liveris, CEO of Dow, said afterward that Trump asked them to come back in 30 days with "a series of actions" that might stimulate manufacturing in the U.S. Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson said in a statement  she was "encouraged by the president's commitment to reduce barriers to job creation," including cutting regulations. "I look forward to continuing to work with President Trump and his team on these important issues," she said. Press Secretary Sean Spicer said  the meeting was productive and ran longer than expected. He said Trump plans to meet with the group next month and then quarterly after that.
January 3, 2017	USA TODAY	The U.S. economy is expected to strengthen next year, in part because of the government stimulus proposed at by President-elect Donald Trump, but job growth is likely to slow as the recovery approaches its eighth anniversary, according to a recent survey of economists. The economy is projected to grow at a 2.3% annual rate in 2017, up from an estimated 1.6% this year, according to the average forecast of 53 economists surveyed earlier this month by Blue Chip Economic Indicators. That's modestly above the tepid 2.1% average that has prevailed since the Great Recession ended in June 2009.  The big wild card: the Trump effect. Quick congressional passage and implementation of his plan to sharply increase infrastructure and defense spending and slash taxes could mean faster growth. But  Trump's threats to slap big tariffs on China and Mexico risk trade wars  that could  roil the economy. "There's a significant downside risk from trade," says Richard Moody, chief economist of Regions Financial. Average monthly job growth is projected to slow to 160,000 from 180,000 so far this year and 229,000 in 2015, according to the economists' average estimate. That's largely because the low, 4.6% unemployment rate is providing employers a smaller pool of available workers, says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. Also, the tandem of solid job gains and a sluggish economy has resulted in anemic increases in productivity, or output per worker hour. Both Zandi and Moody expect businesses to invest in more labor-saving technology next year to bolster productivity, but that likely would curtail hiring. Yet the tight labor market should juice wage increases as employers bid up to attract workers, Zandi says. He predicts average annual earnings growth -- which was 2.5% in November -- will reach 3% to 3.5% by the end of 2017. The higher pay, he says, should draw more discouraged workers back into the labor force, keeping the unemployment rate  roughly flat next year. Consumers, meanwhile, are poised to underpin economic growth again as a result of those fatter paychecks, steady job gains, record housing and stock prices, reduced debt and still-cheap gasoline. The economists surveyed by Blue Chip expect consumption to increase a solid 2.5%, in line with gains in 2016. The difference next year is that business investment is likely to rise and contribute to the economy after falling 0.6% this year. Business capital spending and stockpiling were hammered by myriad factors in the first half of the year, including low oil prices, China's economic slowdown, volatile markets and a strong dollar that hurt exports. But oil prices have doubled since bottoming out early this year, coaxing producers to revive shuttered wells and order steel pipes and other materials from U.S. factories. The greenback had leveled off until a recent rally, bolstering exports. China's economy has stabilized. The Dow is on the cusp of 20,000. And U.S. companies are  replenishing inventories that shrank well below normal levels, partly because paltry sales in the energy sector left little reason to bulk up. The economists surveyed expect business investment to increase 2.7% next year. Michael Englund, chief economist of Action Economics, says Trump's stimulus, combined with his plan to reduce regulations and cut taxes for U.S. companies, already has buoyed business confidence, and that alone could spur more capital spending. Meanwhile, he says, Trump can begin to ease regulations for energy and other firms through executive action to further increase corporate profits and investment. "Businesses have been gun shy" until now, he says. He expects all those effects to increase growth by two-tenths of a percentage point. Zandi forecasts a similar bump based on his belief that some increased military spending and tax cuts for households could take effect by the second half of next year. He expects the economy to grow a healthy 2.8% in 2017. But Moody, who forecasts 2.1% growth, hasn't factored any of those  Trump effects into his forecast, adding it's not clear how much Congress will approve and how long negotiations will drag out. Such developments are likely to temper the economy's gains. 
December 13, 2016	USA TODAY	The evolution from tech CEO to presidential hopeful to possible director of national intelligence -- an appointment floated Monday by The New York Times, which quoted an unnamed Donald Trump transition team member saying she's under consideration for the role -- reflects Fiorina's dogged pursuit of political superlatives. Fiorina and Trump had a "positive and productive meeting" on "issues ranging from America's strategic interests and national security challenges abroad to the geopolitical climate across the world and in China," Fiorina spokesman Frank Sadler said in an email to USA TODAY.  Even as Hewlett Packard CEO in the early 2000s, Fiorina was a natural politician with a gift for public speaking and an eye on higher office. She unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 2010 and again as the Republican nominee for president this year. Now, she may be in line for a spot in the administration of President-elect  Trump, the former rival who publicly ridiculed her appearance and whom she asked to drop out of the race shortly before the national election. If she gets the job, she would bring a view of cybersecurity that's at odds with tech's biggest companies, which have declaimed U.S. government efforts to override their encryption as dangerous and a threat to personal privacy. The one-time bitter political foes met Monday at Trump Tower in New York for what Fiorina called a "productive" discussion about China as "probably our most important adversary and a rising adversary." "We talked about hacking, whether it's Chinese hacking or purported Russian hacking," Fiorina told reporters. During the Republican primary season, Fiorina urged Apple, Google and others to "tear down cyberwalls" to help track down criminals online, a stance that ran in cross currents to Silicon Valley, which publicly supported Apple in its fight with the FBI over hacking into a terrorist's iPhone, and has been building stronger device encryption in the months since. "We could have detected and repelled some of those cyberattacks" if we had passed "a law (that) has been sitting, languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill," she said at the first GOP debate last year. While Beltway insiders are uncertain about the likelihood of a DNI appointment, there is no argument Fiorina would be interested -- notwithstanding Trump's ugly verbal jousting with her on the campaign trail. During a tumultuous five-year reign as CEO of HP, Fiorina displayed a steely resolve, laser-focused intensity and unbowed self-esteem. That was on full display when she almost single-handedly ushered in HP's $24 billion merger with Compaq Computer despite fierce resistance from HP board members and some employees and a contentious court case in Delaware. The merger, Fiorina insisted, was crucial to the long-term success of the iconic Silicon Valley-based company. History, however, has not been kind to Fiorina's judgment. By the time she was forced out of HP in early 2005, the merged HP-Compaq had suffered 30,000 layoffs, and a brutal shareholder showdown fractured its executive ranks. Fiorina steadfastly maintained the megamerger was the victim of the dot-com implosion and a deepening recession in Silicon Valley after the Sept. 11 attacks. She insisted she was vilified for her maverick management style. "When you lead and when you challenge the status quo, you make enemies," she wrote in an essay published on CNN.com last year. 
January 10, 2017	USA TODAY	Alibaba executive chairman Jack Ma met with President-elect Donald Trump on Monday to discuss Ma's plans to create 1 million U.S. jobs by growing trade between U.S. small businesses and Chinese consumers. "It was a great meeting," Trump told reporters at Trump Tower. He also called Ma "a great entrepreneur, one of the best in the world." "He loves this country and he also loves China," Trump said. "Jack and I are going to do some great things."  Monday's meeting, which came amid growing tensions between China and the incoming Trump administration, focused on the Chinese technology giant's plans to expand in the U.S., especially the Midwest, and strengthening relationships between China and the U.S., according to Ma. An editorial in Chinese state media this month warned Trump that he risked "big sticks" if he starts a trade war with China. "There are flowers around the gate of China's Ministry of Commerce, but there are also big sticks hidden inside the door -- they both await Americans," the Communist Party's Global Times newspaper wrote in the editorial responding to the appointment of Robert Lighthizer as U.S. trade representative. Lighthizer is a former trade official in the Ronald Reagan administration who has criticized China on trade. Trump also named Peter Navarro, a UC-Irvine economics professor and China trade critic, to run a White House National Trade Council. "It was a very productive meeting," Ma told reporters. "The door is open to discuss the relationship on trade issues." Ma specifically mentioned agricultural products such as wine and fruit that could be sold through Alibaba to consumers in China and Asia. Alibaba had previously positioned China as a massive market for American goods that could create U.S. jobs but had not pegged how many U.S. jobs it thought that its expansion would create. "$BABA wants to create US jobs by helping US small businesses and farmers sell to China's 300 million-strong middle class," Alibaba tweeted Monday. Ma first outlined the expansion plans in a Wall Street Journal editorial in June 2015. Alibaba aspires to be the digital platform through which all international retailers gain access to Chinese consumers. Alibaba controls about 80% of China's online shopping market with marketplaces such as Taobao and T-Mall. "We want to help U.S entrepreneurs, small-business owners, and brands and companies of all sizes sell their goods to the growing Chinese consumer class. Chinese consumers will get to buy the American products they want. This, in turn, will help create American jobs and increase U.S. exports," Ma wrote at the time. On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to limit global trade, taking aim at China. Steep tariffs on Chinese goods could undercut Alibaba's AliExpress service, which lets Chinese retailers sell to U.S. consumers and U.S. brands  sell to Chinese consumers. Alibaba last month was placed back on a list of counterfeit marketplaces by the United States Trade Representative over sales on its Taobao marketplace of fake and pirated goods, a move that could also dampen international sales. "The purpose of Jack Ma's visit was to frame Alibaba's business with the U.S. in a framework Donald Trump understands, as an innovative company that is creating jobs for both Chinese and Americans," Scott Kennedy, director of the Project on Chinese Business & Political Economy at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, said in an email. "Alibaba's future, in part, will depend on expanding international trade." Alibaba has benefited from constraints on foreign companies in China, Kennedy said. "My guess is that Alibaba wants to highlight how it is different from Chinese state-owned enterprises. ... However, Alibaba's situation is actually more complex." 
December 19, 2016	USA TODAY	Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign chairman said Sunday that President-elect Donald Trump's campaign may have colluded with the Russian government over hacked e-mails in an effort to swing the election.  Without pointing a finger directly at Trump, Podesta said any ties between the Russian hacking and the president-elect's campaign should be revealed to members of the Electoral College before they confirm the election results Monday. "What did 'Trump Inc.' know, and when did they know it?" Podesta said. "Were they in touch with the Russians? I think those are still open questions, and the electors have a right to know what the answers are -- if the United States government has those answers -- before the election." While many pundits have said the Russians wanted to discredit the U.S. election process but did not necessarily aim to elect Trump, Podesta cited examples of direct contacts: Russian diplomats' statements that they were speaking to the Trump campaign; Trump adviser Roger Stone's comments in August that Wikileaks had Podesta's e-mails before they were released; and meetings in Russia before the Republican National Convention between a Trump foreign policy adviser and Russian intelligence officials. All point to the need for an independent investigation, Podesta said -- something incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., endorsed Sunday. Schumer said the special panel should focus on Russia, "but also China and Iran, and their hacking our political system as well as our economic infrastructure and social system." And on CNN's State of the Union, McCain said "the Russians and others, Chinese to a lesser degree, have been able to interfere with our electoral process. ... This is serious business. If they are able to harm the electoral process, then they destroy democracy, which is based on free and fair elections." Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has rejected the idea of a new bipartisan panel in favor of a probe by the existing Senate Committee on Intelligence. But Schumer and McCain, along with GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, said only a special committee can gather all the evidence because of existing committees' separate jurisdictions. On Fox News Sunday, incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said even if there eventually is proof of Russian hacking, it's "insane" to think the Trump campaign coordinated it. "Of course we didn't interface with the Russians. I mean, this whole thing is a spin job," Priebus said. Furthermore, he said, "there's no evidence that shows that the outcome of the election was changed because of a couple of dozen John Podesta e-mails." Donna Brazile, interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman, said on ABC's This Week that Trump's win had more to do with his cracking the "blue wall" of Democratic strongholds in the Midwest, from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin. Still, she said, "Donald Trump used this information in ways to also sow division."
December 28, 2016	USA TODAY	As President-elect Donald Trump and Congress seek to "put America first," they should give special attention to an export sector America has been putting last: nuclear energy. A focus on making nuclear reactors for export may seem quixotic. After all, nuclear power plants in the U.S. are struggling against cheap natural gas and heavily subsidized renewables. And historically, nuclear plants have been built locally, not manufactured and exported. But global demand for electricity is set to rise 70% over the next 25 years, mostly due to increasing demand in developing nations. And technological advances mean that new nuclear reactor components can increasingly be mass-manufactured and shipped around the world.  At stake is a market worth $500 billion to $740 billion over the next decade, according to the Commerce Department, and hundreds of thousands of high-skill and high-wage jobs. U.S. leadership on nuclear power dates back to 1953, when President Eisenhower announced Atoms for Peace, an effort "to provide abundant electrical energy in the power-starved areas of the world." It was a win-win for the U.S. and energy-hungry developing nations. Thanks to this effort, the U.S. today gets 20% of its electricity from nuclear plants, which employ 32,000 workers directly and create an additional 200,000 jobs in the economy. Simply helping China build four nuclear plants has created 20,000 jobs in 20 U.S. states, according to Westinghouse. But global competition is threatening. "Despite the U.S. civil nuclear industry's strengths," the Commerce Department warned, "U.S. companies continue to lose ... market share ... to foreign government owned or led competitors, including Russia, Japan, France, China and the Republic of Korea." The reason: Those nations offer low-cost loans to nations seeking to finance nuclear plant construction. The U.S. does not. Meanwhile, China is racing past America in innovation. China has at least four next-generation nuclear reactors in the works, including one financed by Bill Gates, who is expected to invest millions in the joint venture. The situation facing nuclear plants domestically is urgent. Five U.S. nuclear plants have closed prematurely since 2013. Now, 50% to 75% of them could be shuttered in just a few years, threatening 100,000 to 150,000 high-wage jobs. The problem isn't that nuclear plants are uneconomical, it's that they are punished by discriminatory policies that treat one zero-carbon energy option more favorably than another. In 2013, solar received 281 times more in subsidies per unit of electricity than nuclear, while wind received 17 times more, according to the Energy Information Administration. As a result  some nuclear plants that produce power at costs lower than the wind subsidy could be forced to close. Every one of the five nuclear plants that closed in recent years could have kept running had there been some incentive for owners to invest in retrofits and repairs. The infrastructure bill that Trump and Congress are talking about could launch one, creating thousands of jobs. Building a new plant employs 3,500 people at peak construction. Tax reform should level the playing field. If there is an incentive for pollution-free power, it should go to nuclear plants, not just wind and solar. To support innovation, Trump and Congress should take a page from history and authorize the departments of Defense and Energy to demonstrate and purchase advanced nuclear reactors for use at military bases and laboratories. The Department of Defense already does this with the nuclear reactors it uses in submarines and aircraft carriers. Such an effort will require new regulations. It makes no sense to regulate jet planes the same way we do propeller planes, yet that is how the federal government treats new nuclear reactor types. This new Atoms for Peace effort could inspire and unite the country and the world around something almost everyone wants: cheap, clean energy. Trump should work with Congress to increase the financing of U.S. nuclear plants in foreign nations, and personally involve himself in selling projects to allied nations. Such work would create jobs directly and provide an important driver of economic growth: inexpensive power. Given that nuclear is our largest source of clean energy -- and the only one proven capable of scaling up rapidly -- a new Atoms for Peace effort will do more for clean air and climate change than any number of pollution regulations or United Nations treaties.
March 30, 2016	USA TODAY	The contours of Donald Trump's foreign policy are becoming disturbingly clear. Newspapers have labeled his thinking on international affairs "isolationist" and "unabashedly non-interventionist," yet those terms fail to capture the more alarming elements of his philosophy. Trump apparently is prepared to abandon the United States' most important alliances, even at the risk of those countries acquiring nuclear weapons. In other words, he is prepared to end the decades-long U.S. policy of extended deterrence -- protecting close partners against nuclear attack and thereby limiting the spread of nuclear weapons. Moreover, the presidential candidate gives little indication that he understands the implications of these radical policies for global security and stability.  One theme running through Trump's foreign policy is his disdain for U.S. alliances and allies.  He has called U.S. treaties "one-sided," labeled NATO "obsolete" and repeatedly called on South Korea and Japan to contribute more to U.S. basing costs overseas. Trump appeared surprised in a Washington Post interview to learn that allies pay a substantial portion of U.S. overseas basing costs, with none more supportive than Japan. Yet he also seemed unmoved by this information, insisting that allies should pay no less than a full 100% of U.S. overseas costs. A refusal to do so would force a President Trump to begin withdrawing troops, he told The New York Times. When informed this might cause South Korea and Japan to acquire nuclear weapons, Trump demonstrated a flippant comfort, stating that the U.S. "may very well be better off." It hardly bears noting that abandoning U.S. treaty commitments and acquiescing to nuclear proliferation are completely at odds with decades of U.S. foreign policy. In the darkest days of World War II, American civilian and military leaders identified the merits of establishing a network of overseas bases to allow the United States to address foreign military threats before they could reach the homeland. Furthermore, since after its own use of nuclear weapons against Japan, the U.S. opposes any  countries developing nuclear weapons, on the theory that more arsenals would lead to a more dangerous world, no matter who owned the weapons. Political science studies show that countries under a major power's "nuclear umbrella" are far less likely to seek their own weapons. The converse holds true: When allies grow  concerned about whether their security patron will make good on  treaty promises, they are more likely to seek an independent arsenal. When the U.S. began a major troop withdrawal from Asia during the Nixon administration, Japan and South Korea considered going nuclear. To understand why Trump's views on extended deterrence are terrifying, one must examine his other positions on nuclear policy and strategy. In a December debate, he appeared to be unfamiliar with the nuclear triad, made up of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and bombers that can deliver nuclear weapons to their targets. Just days ago, he refused to rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State terrorist group. In one of the many national security non sequiturs in his Times interview, Trump commented that no one could be sure whether the U.S. nuclear arsenal even worked. This was presumably an allusion to the fact that America observes a de facto moratorium on nuclear testing, but it is contrary to all scientific and technical evidence and a wildly misleading comment at best. Perhaps most unsettling, Trump repeatedly insists that the United States must be more "unpredictable" in its national security policy. His naiveté about the world's most dangerous weapons leads one to infer that he might not have considered the fact that a nuclear Japan and South Korea could lead to dangerous arms races with China and North Korea, proliferation by other states in East Asia and regional instability that invites major crises. Trump's foreign policy interviews might appear to be itinerant ramblings, but on at least one issue, he is crystal clear: He is absolutely not sold on the role that alliances and extended deterrence have played in U.S. global security policy since 1945. Coupled with his erratic nuclear policy positions, this prospective commander in chief's views are not just irresponsible: They are cataclysmically dangerous.

June 16, 2016	USA TODAY	Hillary Clinton told USA TODAY on Wednesday she plans to make the case for why Donald Trump is "temperamentally unfit" to manage the nation's economy and pledged to end a tax loophole for wealthy Americans by executive action if necessary in a preview of a second major policy address, scheduled for next week, that casts the real estate mogul as dangerous and unqualified. In her first interview after meeting with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday night in Washington, Clinton declined to offer a definitive position on one of his key demands as his Democratic presidential bid winds down: that party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz be replaced.  Clinton praised Wasserman Schultz for her commitment to defeating Donald Trump.  This month in San Diego, Clinton delivered a blistering speech that cast Trump as too dangerous to serve as the nation's commander in chief because of  his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, lack of foreign policy knowledge and his temperament. She has continued those attacks in the days following Sunday's Orlando nightclub massacre, the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. In a speech in Columbus, Ohio, next Wednesday, Clinton said she will make "a similar case on the economy that I did on foreign policy: that Donald Trump is erratic and temperamentally unfit to be responsible for the world's largest economy." Clinton pointed to one example of Trump's "incoherent" economic argument by noting that the billionaire has built his populist appeal around leveling the playing field for lower-income Americans, even though she said his tax plan gives a $3 trillion break to millionaires and billionaires over the next 10 years. She pointed out that his proposal would lower rates for hedge-fund and private equity managers by creating a new, lower 15% bracket. "They would actually see their carried interest rate cut by one-third, making the loophole worse rather than closing it," she said. Previewing her speech next week, she said, "He's either completely incoherent or he hasn't thought one bit about his plan." Clinton said she'll pledge that, if Congress does not act, as president she'll ask the Treasury Department to use its regulatory authority to end a  tax advantage, commonly referred to as the carried-interest loophole, that allows hedge-fund managers to pay a lower rate than other taxpayers by counting their income as investment income. Clinton's speech will seek to undercut Trump's appeal to middle- and lower-income Americans who've been drawn to his populist pledges to bring back manufacturing and coal jobs by slapping fines on China and cutting better trade deals. The goal is to demonstrate how his rhetoric does not match his policies, which would disproportionately favor wealthier Americans, according to the campaign. Regarding the meeting with Sanders, the presumptive Democratic nominee did not completely dismiss several of his demands as he refuses to concede the race. "I've seen how committed she is to making sure Donald Trump is not the president," Clinton said of Wasserman Schultz. "I've not heard any conversations in the party about changes," she added, noting the Florida congresswoman was recommended by President Obama. As her campaign vets potential vice presidential candidates, Clinton gave another nod to Sanders, indicating she is prioritizing those with a progressive profile. "We've got a great group of Democrats that are progressive and who agree with me about the direction of the country," she said. As for Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee has doubled down on his proposed temporary ban on Muslims after the Orlando shooting. Party leaders have been critical of the proposal, yet they have not withdrawn their endorsement of Trump. "Now he is accusing our president of somehow encouraging terrorists and it is really offensive, even pathetic," she said. "And I do wonder how Republican leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can stay silent while their presumptive party nominee suggests that the President of the United States supports terrorists." 
July 21, 2016	USA TODAY	To understand how political newcomer Donald Trump managed to capture the Republican presidential nomination, and the challenges he faces winning the general election in November, drive an hour south from the glitzy GOP convention in Cleveland to Stark County. Trump lost the county to favorite son Gov. John Kasich, 48% to 38%, in Ohio's primary in March. But the nominee's anti-establishment message resonates in this swing county in a swing state. "People are ticked off, and they want change," says Janet Creighton, a county commissioner and Kasich delegate who now supports Trump. Stark County -- home to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the McKinley Presidential Library & Museum and the National First Ladies' Library -- is particularly fertile ground for the GOP candidate's criticism of trade deals and vows to return jobs to the Rust Belt.  The county has lost a third of its manufacturing jobs in the past 15 years. To the extent that those jobs have been replaced, it has been with fast-food and health care jobs with lower pay and stingier benefits. People don't necessary believe that Trump can bring back those lost jobs -- he can't, and no one can -- but many think he'll make it more difficult and less attractive for employers to move jobs overseas. Nowhere is the impact of manufacturing's decline starker than in North Canton, where the hulking brick shell of the old Hoover vacuum cleaner plant stretches along Main Street. Founded here in 1908, Hoover once employed 3,000 unionized workers in 1 million square feet of space. But over two decades starting in the mid-1980s, Hoover and later its new owners shifted the production jobs from North Canton to Texas, Mexico and ultimately China. Today, membership in Local 1985 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers is down to 16. The union hall across the street from the plant is scheduled to close for good at the end of July. The county's largest and most important manufacturing employer, Timken, also faces tough times. Under pressure from activist investors, the company split into two concerns in 2014, one focused on making steel and one on bearings. The split is a long and complex story, but it provides more evidence that the system is rigged against working-class people in favor of Wall Street. Since the split, TimkenSteel, in particular, has been hurt by weak energy markets and foreign competition. Athens restaurant, in a Canton neighborhood near one of the Timken facilities, used to be packed with shift workers in what people refer to as the good old days. Now it attracts a sparser lunchtime combination of blue- and white-collar employees. Ask diners about the presidential race, and the answers verify Stark County's reputation as a key electoral battleground within Ohio, a must-win state for presidential candidates. There's the retiree who changed his registration to Republican this year just so he could vote against Trump.  There's the veteran Canton police officer unhappy with Hillary Clinton's support for the Black Lives Matter movement. The common theme is a distinct lack of enthusiasm for either Trump or Clinton, mirroring the national polls that reflect two highly unpopular candidates. Voters' comments reflect the talking points on their favorite partisan media: Clinton is dishonest. Trump is an unpredictable narcissist who needs to be kept away from the nuclear codes. In the past four presidential elections, Stark County has swung back and forth from Republican George W. Bush (2000) to Democrat John Kerry (2004) to Democrat Barack Obama (2008) to Republican Mitt Romney (2012), all by narrow margins and all reflecting discontent with the incumbent party. Some residents are wrestling, even agonizing, about their votes this time around. "It's unbelievable that in a country of 320 million people, this is the choice we have," says Don Leuchtag, 83, president of a material handling and storage equipment company. Donald Trump? He's offended too many people, and it's a "pipe dream" to think you can wall off America from immigrants and global commerce. Leuchtag is right about that. For people in the Rust Belt communities where this presidential election will be contested, Trump is selling an unattainable return to what they regard as glory days gone by -- and making preposterous promises that, if he's elected, seem destined to leave people on Main Street in North Canton even more disillusioned about politicians than they already are.
July 27, 2016	USA TODAY	If history is any guide -- and it often hasn't been in this unusual election year -- Donald Trump will be in trouble if he fails to carry North Carolina in November's presidential election. "I'm going to be in North Carolina so much that you're going to get so sick and tired of me," the businessman-turned-Republican-nominee told a cheering crowd of supporters Monday at a fairground arena near the Wake Forest University football stadium. As Hillary Clinton and the Democrats held their convention in Philadelphia, Trump spent two days in North Carolina telling voters that bad trade deals bleed their state of lifelong manufacturing jobs. In arguing that "we're going to bring our jobs back to North Carolina," Trump talks to a state that has been a key part of the Republican Party's "Southern strategy" for more than four decades -- where a changing economy and electorate make it a prime turnaround target for Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. The state's 15 electoral votes are essential for a Republican candidate seeking the 270 needed to win. "Trump needs North Carolina to get to 270 more than Clinton needs North Carolina to get to 270," said Ferrel Guillory, director of the Program on Public Life at the University of North Carolina. In many ways, he said, North Carolina is ripe for Trump's trade message: The state's blue-collar workers, many of them in the textile and furniture manufacturing industries, were hit hard by the financial crisis and recession of 2008. They are receptive to the Republican businessman's message that "bad" free-trade deals led to the loss of manufacturing jobs to other countries. "North Carolina used to be a tobacco and textile state -- and now both of them have been decimated," said Diana Gwyn, 58, a retired probation and parole officer from Mount Airy who likes Trump's "law and order" theme. During his rally in Winston-Salem, Trump attributed the state's lost manufacturing jobs to "incompetent" federal officials negotiating poor trade deals and allowing China to get away with unfair practices. Trump touched on the economy during a speech Tuesday in Charlotte to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, telling veterans, "Our terrible trade deals must be renegotiated." He discussed his plans to improve veterans health care, saying the country must "never again break our sacred commitment" to those who have fought for the United States. Since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, only two Democratic presidential candidates have taken North Carolina: fellow Southerner Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Barack Obama in 2008. Clinton is trying to follow the Obama playbook, appealing to voters who have flooded into the state to fill the state's new economy, including research and development, pharmaceuticals and banking and finance. This month, she made her first joint appearance with President Obama in Charlotte, the city where the Democrats held their convention four years ago. Blasting Trump as lacking the qualifications and temperament to be president, Clinton told people in Charlotte, "This election is our chance to say our country is better than this." Rising numbers of college-educated white-collar workers, single women and minority voters propelled Obama to a narrow victory in North Carolina eight years ago. 
December 9, 2016	USA TODAY	To many Americans, President-elect Donald Trump's tough talk on trade and his badgering of U.S. corporations are sweet music. The USA has lost more than 5million manufacturing jobs in the past two decades, partly because of automation and partly because of corporations shipping jobs to lower-wage places such as Mexico, India, Pakistan and China.  But Trump's behavior -- particularly his singling out individual companies -- is likely to backfire. In recent days, he has threatened to impose a 35% tariff on products re-imported by companies such as valve-maker Rexnord Corp., which plans to move about 300 jobs abroad. He also demanded the cancellation of a Boeing contract minutes after the publication of an article in which its CEO made an appeal for trade. (Trump denies any connection between the article and the demand.) There are good reasons why presidents typically don't single out individual companies for punishment. Such behavior violates basic principles of democracy and free enterprise by having politicians pick winners and losers. It also substitutes presidential whim for the consistent rules and laws that have made America such a good place to do business. It is also counterproductive. Even if Americans are fed up with jobs going abroad, consider the implications of retaliating against an individual company such as Rexnord. A tariff would certainly hurt the company. But it would be a boon to its foreign competitors that import into the USA, as well as to fellow American companies that have already moved plants overseas. Any tariff is a tax on American consumers. And while presidents have wide latitude to impose tariffs, imposing them on single companies would be, at the very least, a novel reading of the law. Tariffs, whether they are imposed on a single company or on an entire industry or country, could be an ugly spectacle. Countries such as China have made it abundantly clear that they would retaliate against unilaterally imposed tariffs. That could set off destructive trade wars. Companies move abroad for a variety of reasons. In some cases, it is principally to save money and boost returns for its shareholders, which include retirement funds that Americans rely on. Often, it is to produce closer to the companies' overseas customers, which is the same reason many Japanese automakers and other companies have built plants in the USA. Boeing, a leading U.S. exporter, is under immense pressure from foreign buyers to locate production facilities in their countries. It is also an iconic American brand that would be one of the first to face retaliatory measures should Trump start a trade war. It is only natural that Boeing would be vociferously pro-trade. Commerce creates winners and losers, and more needs to be done to aid displaced workers. But when Trump swoops in company-by-company to speak his mind and make threats, his efforts will probably do more harm than good. 
November 14, 2016	USA TODAY	As Western Europe gears up for a string of elections over the next year, right-wing parties are seizing on Donald Trump's victory as proof that a strong nationalistic stance against trade and immigration will propel them into power. A wave of populism already has spread to Eastern Europe, where countries that include Croatia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia have rightist  governments.  Farther west, Austria next month could elect Europe's first far-right head of state since World War II. Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party narrowly lost a race for the largely ceremonial post in April, but a new election was ordered because of alleged irregularities in counting mailed ballots. France, Germany and the Netherlands, which hold general elections in 2017, also have seen a U.S.-style shift in support from mainstream parties to anti-establishment nationalists. The trend comes amid growing anxiety over weak job prospects tied to globalization, as well as a migrant crisis seen as a threat to security and a drain on social welfare benefits. Many Europeans blame the problems on decades of membership in the European Union, which they feel is oblivious to their concerns about the free flow of labor and migration within the 28-nation bloc. "People are sick and tired of politicians who refused to listen to their worries about rising immigration, the loss of law and order, taxes being spent abroad while domestic needs are rising, trade agreements that harm employment at home," said Geert Wilders, a Dutch lawmaker and leader of the Netherlands' far-right Party for Freedom. "We are witnessing a Patriotic Spring, in America as well as in Europe," he told USA TODAY. "Our people have the same worries as the American people. The Trump victory proves that change is possible." Wouter Dol of the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy, a group that helps young democracies organize elections, said Wilders paints himself as a political outsider like Trump despite being a seasoned politician with more than a decade of lawmaking experience. Wilders is expected to mount a serious challenge to Prime Minister Mark Rutte's conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy in March elections. "The traditional parties have not been sensing the temperature of society very well," said Dol. Trump's backers identify with his vow to reject the political elite and take back control of American institutions and policy that he claims have been undermined by years of corrupt and inefficient government. "The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer," Trump declared in his victory speech early Wednesday. "This is part of a worldwide phenomenon. It's in the U.S., Europe, but also in Russia, Turkey, China," said Michael Wohlgemuth, director of the Berlin office of Open Europe, a research organization. "There's pretty much a similar pattern everywhere you look, and a lot of it is about identity politics," he added. One of those shocks could come in France next spring. Polls in French media show Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, will comfortably sail into the second round of a presidential election for the first time, although she might not emerge the ultimate winner. "Nothing is immutable," Le Pen said after Trump's win. Her father, party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, said on Twitter: "Today, the United States, tomorrow France." Approval ratings for France's current president, socialist Fran¸ois Hollande, are abysmal in the wake of a string of terror attacks. In Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel must call an election before October, Wohlgemuth from Open Europe said that despite recent gains in state and local elections by the right-wing and anti-EU Alternative für Deutschland party (AfD), Germans are unlikely to vote to "pull up the draw-bridge" next year. "Nationalism and Germany in a post-World War II world do not go together very well," he said. "You won't see AfD as part of any government. We believe in principles and values and not emotional rhetoric." Ronald Gläser, a recently elected AfD lawmaker in Berlin, said his party shares some "convictions" with Trump. Gläser said he hoped Trump would make good on a proposal to reduce U.S. forces  around the world and make America more isolationist. "Germans don't want to be spied on by the National Security Agency, and we don't appreciate American wars overseas." 
August 12, 2016	USA TODAY	Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told factory workers near Detroit on Thursday that her economic plan will bring jobs back to the American heartland, while her opponent Donald Trump was offering nothing but a pessimistic view of America as a failed Third World state. In her speech at Futuramic Tool & Engineering in suburban Warren, Mich., Clinton tried to paint a stark contrast with the plan offered Monday by Trump at the Detroit Economic Club.  Blasting Trump for what she called his pessimistic view of America, she told the crowd, "There is nothing we can't do if we do it together." Contrasting her own  message with Trump's, she said, "He is missing so much about what makes Michigan great. He describes America as an embarrassment. He says we're becoming a Third World country. Look around you, my friends." Clinton also addressed trade, an issue on which Trump has criticized her for supporting deals that cost American jobs. Promising to get tough with China and any other nation that tries to "game the system" or kill American jobs, Clinton said she would impose tariffs on trade cheaters and appoint the first "chief trade prosecutor" to enforce trade regulations. Saying America's best days are still ahead, she told the crowd, "This is personal for me," she said. "I'm a product of the middle class." She also drew an Olympics analogy: "If Team USA was as fearful as Trump, Michael Phelps and Simone Biles would be cowering in the locker room, afraid to come out and compete. Instead, they're winning gold medals," she said. Rattling off a host of ideas, she said she wanted broadband Internet service in every home, paid family leave, a higher federal minimum wage, clean water in Flint, initiatives for small business and entrepreneurs and a program to modernize infrastructure. She also said she wanted students to be able to refinance their student debt at affordable rates, and she hopes to boost community college training programs. She said she will work to put Americans to work building and modernizing roads, airports, bridges and ports. "We are way overdue for this," she said. The Trump campaign, in a series of email responses to Clinton's remarks, slammed the Democratic presidential nominee and what it called her "failed economic agenda." "Right now the American economy is only working for the rigged system in Washington and on Wall Street, yet Hillary Clinton is running to keep things as they are," said Dan Kowalski, deputy national policy director for Trump, in a statement. "Clinton's plans today will short circuit our economy by raising taxes, increasing spending and killing jobs." Just before her speech, Clinton toured the Futuramic plant with owner Mark Jurcak and met with employees who are making rocket boosters for NASA and parts for the F-35 fighter jet. She asked about the materials used in the components and talked with employees about their training and background. The Warren company has a working apprenticeship partnership with Macomb Community College to train the workers in advanced manufacturing. "I was told about the absolute perfection that is required to do this work," Clinton told the crowd. "What is happening here can happen in so many places if we put our mind to it and support advanced manufacturing."
August 24, 2016	USA TODAY	What do you have to lose? Donald Trump keeps asking African Americans. But really that's his question to all of us. The premise of his campaign is that our country is so weak, and our leaders are such losers, that we should put all our money on Trump the wild card, the savior. Trump made that explicit the other day by christening himself "Mr. Brexit." He's the candidate of disruptive change, exciting and unsettling and the ride of your life. Trump may be asking "what do you have to lose?" as a rhetorical question, but there's an answer to it, and that answer is "an enormous amount." I'm not even talking about the temperament issues that unnerve so many in both parties as they contemplate Trump in charge of nuclear codes, the military and relationships across the globe. Let's look purely at economics and other indicators of national health.  The stock market continues to set new records during President Obama's tenure, and only George H.W. Bush presided over a bull market for a greater percentage of his time in office. The jobs report for July, released Aug. 5, was so positive that conservative economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin called it "strong across the board."  Republican leaders were silent rather than issuing their usual negative responses. House Speaker Paul Ryan did take to Twitter that day to bemoan what he called Obama's legacy of "broken promises, a stagnant economy, growing global threats and an anxious nation." But the tweets were about the administration's prematurely named "Recovery Summer" of 2010. They were jarring on a day the Labor Department reported 255,000 new jobs, rising wages, rising labor force participation and a 4.9% unemployment rate. Not all the statistics are stellar. Growth in the gross domestic product has been disappointing and, until now, participation in the workforce has lagged. Older workers are having trouble finding their place in a labor market transformed by technology, globalization and the Great Recession. The recession took a terrible toll on black household wealth. Yet black Americans, like all Americans, would stand to lose plenty under President Trump. They'd have to put up with his inaccurate stereotyping of African Americans and hostility to the Black Lives Matter movement. From a pocketbook standpoint, his protectionist views could trigger trade wars and higher prices. And he'd revive trickle-down economics, a major contrast to Obama policies that have directed resources to low-income rather than high-income Americans. Do we really want to trade these gains  for a guy whose new tax plan is a boon for the wealthy, the national debt and lenders like China? As acerbic liberal Jason Sattler (aka @LOLGOP)  put it on Twitter, "Trump is offering 'change' the way a high-impact collision with a tree offers your car 'customizing.'" Not to overdo the analogy, but Brexit was a perfect example of rocking the boat out of sheer frustration -- and then being stunned by the outcome. The value of the British pound has plummeted. There's  talk of companies moving from London to Dublin, Frankfurt and Paris to keep maximum access to the European Union market. There is, inevitably, "a certain chilling effect on investment" due to uncertainty,  David O'Sullivan, the EU ambassador to the U.S., told the USA TODAY Editorial Board this month. Scotland is again weighing secession from the United Kingdom. O'Sullivan said the Brexit vote could even disrupt relations between Ireland and Northern Ireland, where the border became a non-issue once both were in the EU. This is the year of feeling threatened, of wanting to "take our country back," whether that country is the U.K. or the U.S. Trump and Ryan are not the only Republicans trying to sell a narrative of America the pathetic. Even as Bill Clinton was praising his wife onstage at the Democratic convention, Marco Rubio sent a fundraising email that originated in an unrecognizable reality. "Obama's vision for America has been a disaster," wrote the unsuccessful presidential candidate, now running for re-election to the Senate. "And yet, Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton actually want to continue the failed policies that have weakened our great country and our citizens." Disaster. Failed. Weak. These are the words that propelled Trump to the  GOP nomination. He says  he's the only one who can fix things and "it won't even be that hard."
December 6, 2016	USA TODAY	While preparing to fill more Cabinet slots, Donald Trump on Monday tapped Ben Carson for secretary of Housing and Urban Development, met with former vice president Al Gore, and expanded his search for a secretary of State amid new friction with China. The president-elect formally confirmed weeks-long plans to nominate Carson, saying the retired neurosurgeon and former Republican primary rival has a "brilliant mind" and is "passionate" about meeting the challenges facing the nation's cities.  "We have talked at length about my urban renewal agenda and our message of economic revival, very much including our inner cities," Trump said. "Ben shares my optimism about the future of our country and is part of ensuring that this is a Presidency representing all Americans." Carson, who at one point demurred about joining Trump's Cabinet, said: "I feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly by strengthening communities that are most in need. We have much work to do in enhancing every aspect of our nation and ensuring that our nation's housing needs are met." During the Republican primary campaign, Trump attacked Carson, referring to him at one point as "pathological." Democrats denounced the former doctor and prominent social conservative. The Senate must confirm Carson's nomination. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Carson "is a disconcerting and disturbingly unqualified choice to lead a department as complex and consequential as Housing and Urban Development." Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller said Trump will formally unveil his secretary of Defense nominee -- retired Marine Corps general James Mattis -- at a rally Tuesday in Fayetteville, N.C.; the stop will be the second of Trump's "Thank You Tour." The meeting between Gore and Trump; the ex-vice president also spoke with Ivanka Trump, the president-elect's daughter. One topic: Climate change, reportedly one of Ivanka Trump's top concerns. Afterward, Gore said he had "a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect," who has been skeptical of climate change concerns. A Tuesday schedule that include meetings with Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, mentioned as a U.S. ambassador to China; and radio talk show host Laura Ingraham, a potential press secretary. After saying that he had narrowed his search -- former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, ex-New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker and ex-CIA director David Petraeus -- aides said Trump is looking at more names.

Trump said. "I don't think so!"
