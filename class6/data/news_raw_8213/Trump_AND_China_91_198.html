</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Congress seek to &quot;put America first,&quot; they should give special attention to an export sector America has been putting last: nuclear energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A focus on making nuclear reactors for export may seem quixotic. After all, nuclear power plants in the U.S. are struggling against cheap natural gas and heavily subsidized renewables. And historically, nuclear plants have been built locally, not manufactured and exported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But global demand for electricity is set to rise 70% over the next 25 years, mostly due to increasing demand in developing nations. And technological advances mean that new nuclear reactor components can increasingly be mass-manufactured and shipped around the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At stake is a market worth $500 billion to $740 billion over the next decade, according to the Commerce Department, and hundreds of thousands of high-skill and high-wage jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Atoms for Peace'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. leadership on nuclear power dates back to 1953, when President Eisenhower announced Atoms for Peace, an effort &quot;to provide abundant electrical energy in the power-starved areas of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a win-win for the U.S. and energy-hungry developing nations. Thanks to this effort, the U.S. today gets 20% of its electricity from nuclear plants, which employ 32,000 workers directly and create an additional 200,000 jobs in the economy. Simply helping </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> build four nuclear plants has created 20,000 jobs in 20 U.S. states, according to Westinghouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But global competition is threatening. &quot;Despite the U.S. civil nuclear industry's strengths,&quot; the Commerce Department warned, &quot;U.S. companies continue to lose ... market share ... to foreign government owned or led competitors, including Russia, Japan, France, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Republic of Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason: Those nations offer low-cost loans to nations seeking to finance nuclear plant construction. The U.S. does not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is racing past America in innovation. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has at least four next-generation nuclear reactors in the works, including one financed by Bill Gates, who is expected to invest millions in the joint venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation facing nuclear plants domestically is urgent. Five U.S. nuclear plants have closed prematurely since 2013. Now, 50% to 75% of them could be shuttered in just a few years, threatening 100,000 to 150,000 high-wage jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem isn't that nuclear plants are uneconomical, it's that they are punished by discriminatory policies that treat one zero-carbon energy option more favorably than another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rethinking subsidies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2013, solar received 281 times more in subsidies per unit of electricity than nuclear, while wind received 17 times more, according to the Energy Information Administration. As a result  some nuclear plants that produce power at costs lower than the wind subsidy could be forced to close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's needed is bold leadership on infrastructure, tax reform and energy policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every one of the five nuclear plants that closed in recent years could have kept running had there been some incentive for owners to invest in retrofits and repairs. The infrastructure bill that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Congress are talking about could launch one, creating thousands of jobs. Building a new plant employs 3,500 people at peak construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tax reform should level the playing field. If there is an incentive for pollution-free power, it should go to nuclear plants, not just wind and solar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To support innovation, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Congress should take a page from history and authorize the departments of Defense and Energy to demonstrate and purchase advanced nuclear reactors for use at military bases and laboratories. The Department of Defense already does this with the nuclear reactors it uses in submarines and aircraft carriers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such an effort will require new regulations. It makes no sense to regulate jet planes the same way we do propeller planes, yet that is how the federal government treats new nuclear reactor types.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This new Atoms for Peace effort could inspire and unite the country and the world around something almost everyone wants: cheap, clean energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should work with Congress to increase the financing of U.S. nuclear plants in foreign nations, and personally involve himself in selling projects to allied nations. Such work would create jobs directly and provide an important driver of economic growth: inexpensive power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that nuclear is our largest source of clean energy -- and the only one proven capable of scaling up rapidly -- a new Atoms for Peace effort will do more for clean air and climate change than any number of pollution regulations or United Nations treaties.</SPAN></P>
