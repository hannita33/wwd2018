<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday, top tech CEOs are expected to sit down with president-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in New York to discuss what remains a mystery: how the new administration will treat the nation's high-tech engine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at least one confirmed attendee -- Telsa CEO Elon Musk -- may be more eager for a sit-down with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Transportation secretary nominee, Elaine Chao.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the new head of the DOT, replacing outgoing secretary Anthony Foxx, Chao, 63, would take the wheel of a department just as it was beginning to corral the players shaping our self-driving car future under a cohesive national plan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there's evidence this future-tech needs federal oversight: last week, Michigan became the first state to approve testing of self-driving cars with no safety drivers at the wheel, raising the prospect of a vehicle being legal in one state and illegal in another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Chao's public service record is extensive, her leadership tenure as Labor secretary and at the head of organizations such as the United Way and the Peace Corps doesn't shed much light on how she would rule on autonomous driving issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September, Foxx released a book-length document that served as the Obama administration's endorsement of self-driving cars as a safe and environmentally friendly alternative to human-piloted machines, which kill some 30,000 people a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In stark contrast, the 2016 Republican platform chastises the current administration for &quot;its ill-named Livability Initiative (that) is meant to 'coerce people out of their cars.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Chao, if confirmed, stick by the party line and look to scrap the document and start over?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She could in theory, but everyone recognizes this is going to happen one way or the other,&quot; says Paul Mackie, spokesman for Mobility Lab, a publicly funded research institute that provides information about transportation alternatives and solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mackie suggests that Chao's role is more as &quot;cheerleader&quot; given that many of the nitty gritty decisions about how municipalities go about solving mobility challenges remain at the state and local level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation is facing one of its biggest shifts in transportation with the advent of self-driving cars, and the federal government is likely to help shape this rapidly approaching reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A longtime Republican and Capitol Hill stalwart, Chao, 63, served two terms as Labor secretary under George W. Bush, after which she returned to a post at the conservative Heritage Foundation and provided commentary for Fox News. She is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, another longtime fixture of the GOP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a few 2015 speeches at the American Action Forum, Chao offered a glimpse into her views on both transportation and labor matters. She praised ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft -- which also are working on autonomous vehicles -- and the opportunities they provide employees of the so-called gig economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At a minimum, government policies must not stifle the innovation that has made this sector such an explosive driver of job growth and opportunity,&quot; Chao said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, Uber and Lyft have been sued by drivers in cities such as San Francisco and New York; the drivers say they should be treated as employees, not independent contractors. Uber has strongly defended the contractor designation while rolling out perks to drivers, like access to retirement plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While DOT secretary, Chao would not have jurisdiction over such matters; she could use her position to influence whoever lands in her old post of Labor secretary, suggests Jim Evans, attorney with the labor and employment group at Alston &amp; Bird. &quot;She could influence if not directly than indirectly,&quot; Evans says. &quot;There's the potential for DOT and Labor appointees to bless the independent contractor models that these companies rely on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evans says to do otherwise would likely spell the end of Uber and Lyft. Although there are no specifics on either company's business model, many experts assume the prodigious amount of capital raised by a company such as Uber -- $16 billion so far at a valuation of $69 billion -- is being spent largely to subsidize rides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A quick look at how Chao may rule on broader transportation issues can be gleaned from the 2016 Republican Platform, which laments that a good deal of DOT funding is incorrectly used for bike-share programs, sidewalks, recreational trails, landscaping and historical renovations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it comes down firm on the issue of expensive high-speed rail initiatives: &quot;We reaffirm our intention to end federal support for boondoggles like California's high-speed train to nowhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chao may want to revisit that  smackdown of high-speed rail, considering the numerous times candidate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> praised </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sleek mass-transit bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have trains that go 300 miles per hour,&quot; the billionaire exclaimed on a campaign stop last March. &quot;We have trains that go chug ... chug ... chug.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
