</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton painted Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ideas and temperament as a dangerous combination that could lead to another recession, in a swing-state speech extending her critique of the presumptive GOP nominee's fitness to serve as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just as he shouldn't have his finger on the button, he shouldn't have his hands on our economy,&quot; Clinton told nearly 300 people in a speech in Columbus, Ohio, on Tuesday. Despite his success as a businessman, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;would throw us back into recession,&quot; the presumptive Democratic nominee said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pugnacious personality is one lens through which Clinton's campaign is building its case against the real estate mogul. In her speech Tuesday -- heavy with &quot;and I quote&quot; references to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> words -- Clinton rebutted idea after idea </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has proposed, seeking to show his business experience doesn't translate to strong proposals for the country's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would wipe out post-crash rules on banks, give sweeping tax cuts that could widen deficits, cancel trade deals and deport immigrants in the USA without documentation, leading to uncertainty and economic disaster, Clinton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The full faith and credit of the United States is not something we just gamble away,&quot; she said. &quot;The United States of America doesn't do business </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> way. And it matters when a presidential candidate talks like this, because the world hangs on every word our president says. ... Someone should tell him our nation's economy isn't a game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much like in a recent speech in San Diego in which Clinton deemed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;temperamentally unfit&quot; to lead the nation in foreign affairs, she warned that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policies and leadership approach would pose a danger to American economic security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign responded to Clinton in a barrage of emails and tweets, unusual in their resemblance to typical campaign &quot;opposition&quot; from aides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in one tweet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The billionaire's policies would grow jobs by lifting regulations on businesses and energy production and by enforcing penalties for other countries' currency manipulation and intellectual property theft, his campaign said in an email. Another email quoted from a book by a former Secret Service agent, calling Clinton &quot;volcanic, impulsive, enabled by sycophants, and disdainful of the rules set for everyone else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton attacked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for having a predilection for playing with debt, warning he would bankrupt the country like he did his casinos in Atlantic City. A trail of thousands of lawsuits, including those involving his defunct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University and others involving unpaid bills, show that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> makes &quot;over-the-top promises&quot; to people that fall apart, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People get hurt,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;He's written a lot of books about business. They all seem to end at Chapter 11.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a tweet, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> countered he would approach the U.S. economy differently than he approached his business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am 'the king of debt,'&quot; he tweeted. &quot;That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton first previewed Tuesday's approach in an interview last week with USA TODAY. Her senior adviser, Jake Sullivan, echoed those themes in a statement Monday night. &quot;Everything that applies to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> about national security is equally true when it comes to the economy,&quot; Sullivan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we were to put Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> behind the wheel of the American economy, he would very likely drive us off a cliff and working families would bear the brunt of the impact in terms of lost jobs, lost savings and lost livelihoods,&quot; Sullivan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed to a new report from Moody's Analytics finding that the economy &quot;will be significantly weaker&quot; if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic proposals were to be adopted. The report predicted stagnant incomes, a &quot;lengthy recession&quot; and stock and real house value declines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton will outline her own economic vision in a separate speech Wednesday in Raleigh, N.C. according to the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presumptive Democratic nominee blasted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Tuesday for not releasing his tax returns. &quot;You have to ask yourself, what's he afraid of?&quot; Clinton said. &quot;Maybe he isn't as rich as he claims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton suggested </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might not have paid much in taxes or might not have given much money to charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton stated her economic case against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Ohio, the quintessential swing state. A poll Tuesday morning showed her tied with the real estate mogul in a two-way Ohio race: Each candidate got 40%. Clinton trailed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by 4 points in the same poll a month earlier. Part of the survey was conducted before the Orlando shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Ohio Republicans have been slow to support </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who lost to Ohio Gov. John Kasich in the state's GOP primary.</SPAN></P>
