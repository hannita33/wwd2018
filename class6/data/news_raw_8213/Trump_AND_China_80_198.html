<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his improbable race to the presidency, President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> treated tech as he did much of the electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He trash-talked it in tweets, offering few insights on a $2.9 trillion  industry that's been in overdrive, but for which he has no discernible policy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 140 characters or less, he called for a boycott of Apple when it didn't cave to the FBI's request to hack the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino (Calif.) shooters. He chided Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos because, he claimed, Amazon didn't pay &quot;fair taxes.&quot; And </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has urged Apple and others to make hardware in the U.S. instead of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to  make &quot;America first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has outlined  policies on trade, tax reform, immigration and jobs that could  reverberate through industry and its investors. His hard-line stance against mergers, in particular AT&amp;T-Time Warner, could also weaken  thirst for M&amp;A and IPOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will see far less IPOs and exits in the short term as big tech companies and VCs wait and see what kind of president </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be,&quot; says Ben Parr, co-founder of Octane AI, a bot-creation  start-up in San Francisco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has espoused tighter immigration and  boosting American workers, possibly putting a dent in the hiring plans of tech start-ups and  dissuading foreign entrepreneurs from establishing operations in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The H-1B program, a non-immigrant visa program that lets employers temporarily hire foreign workers in specialized jobs, is &quot;threatened,&quot; says Mark Goines, vice chairman of Personal Capital, an online financial-advisory firm based in San Francisco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we want to keep jobs here, then we have to train engineers here,&quot; Goines says. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't want to impose more programs, so re-training people to become tech workers is critical to restructuring employment in America. It's not clear if you change the core rules of H-1B that it will actually benefit the American workforce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a sensitive topic in tech, where 51% of billion-dollar start-ups in the U.S. were founded by immigrants and 70% of their key hires are from outside the country, according to a non-partisan study on entrepreneurship from the National Foundation for American Policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repeated promise to declare </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a manipulator of currency could lead to tariffs of 45% on Chinese imports and 35% on products from Mexico, though some economists expect more modest tariffs. <BR></SPAN></P>
