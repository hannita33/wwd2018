<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seriously thinks he can serve as president of the United States while maintaining a worldwide real estate empire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because he is already wealthy, he argues, Americans need not worry about his trying to get richer while in office. Because his children will be running the business, he will be walled off from its decisions. And because he is forgoing the annual $400,000 presidential salary, Americans can rest assured that he will put their interests ahead of his.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will soon find out how wrong he is. The problem isn't just that he stands to make money from the increased visibility his businesses will have thanks to his presidency. It is that his financial ties in foreign countries  will vastly complicate U.S. diplomacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won't be able to deal with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or Germany without the world being reminded that he is in debt to banks in those countries. He won't be able to deal with South Korea without friends and foes questioning his motives given his ties to a major defense and construction company there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not liquidate his holdings as quickly as practically possible and select a trustee to invest his wealth within a blind trust, he threatens to hobble his presidency in the same way Bill Clinton's libido crippled his. Short of a real blind trust, his businesses will become a constant source of controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has business partners around the globe, many of them deeply enmeshed in their nations' politics, their governments' contracting decisions and -- in many cases -- local scandals or lawsuits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Newsweek, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization is heavily invested in a real estate project in the Indian state of Maharashtra, where he is at the mercy of the state government, which is investigating whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> local partner properly acquired the land for the development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is allied with an indicted Turkish businessman who is an adversary of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a vital but troublesome ally of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has partnered with Daewoo Engineering and Construction, a company that would benefit greatly if South Korea increased its military spending as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has recommended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. relations with India, Turkey and South Korea as well as those countries' regional rivals -- Pakistan, Greece and North Korea -- could be deeply compromised by the ongoing business deals of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization. The same would be true with other countries when journalists and critics discover undisclosed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> partnerships (which, like his tax returns, he steadfastly refuses to divulge).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> children continue to operate his businesses across the globe and in the United States, new conflicts will arise as adventuresome businessmen with their own political and financial agendas use investments and other business deals with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> empire to curry favor with the  administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not set up a genuine blind trust, he will soon wish he had. And American voters will soon wonder why they gave the highest office in the land to someone with so many impediments to governing effectively. <BR></SPAN></P>
