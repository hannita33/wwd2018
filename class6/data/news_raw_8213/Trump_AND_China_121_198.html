<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Election Day could be doomsday -- or just another day -- for Wall Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With just days until the presidential election, Wall Street remains on high alert. Investors are in risk-watch mode thanks to a bitter campaign punctuated by narrowing polls, candidates with low likability ratings and unexpected bombshells like claims of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> groping women and the FBI's ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are three shocks that could rock markets:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">TRUMP</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WIN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be a big surprise, one few investors saw coming. Even </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says if he pulls off the upset it would equate to &quot;Brexit times 10,&quot; or way bigger than the shock waves the United Kingdom sent through markets in June when it voted to exit the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stocks will likely sell off if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> triumphs. Barclays says the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index has downside risk of 11% to 13% if the billionaire businessman wins. Declines could be as big as &quot;10% to 15%,&quot; according to a  paper by University of Michigan's Justin Wolfers, Dartmouth's Eric Zitzewitz and the National Bureau of Economic Research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And don't rule out a bear market if Clinton loses, warns Don Luskin, chief investment officer at financial research firm TrendMacro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wins ... stocks will drop at least 20% just like that,&quot; Luskin told USA TODAY. &quot;Because markets hate to be surprised and hate it when the conventional wisdom is dead wrong. Just look at the reaction to Brexit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are investors so averse to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Too many unknowns and too little political experience, says Thomas Block, Washington policy strategist at FundStrat Global Advisors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't see how investors can envision what his administration would look like,&quot; Block told USA TODAY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Plus I don't see his harsh rhetoric and take-no-prisoners negotiating style working with strong-willed legislators. Relations with allies in Europe and Asia could seriously deteriorate, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with its large U.S. Treasury holdings, would be very anxious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A DEMOCRATIC SWEEP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial pain would also likely be felt if Clinton takes the White House and Democrats retake control of the Senate and House of Representatives, although odds still favor the GOP holding the House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A Democratic sweep is a tail risk,&quot; says Andy Laperriere, head of U.S. Policy Research for Cornerstone Macro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An election hat trick would enable Democrats to take fuller control of the legislative process, making it easier for Clinton to push through her less business-friendly platform of higher taxes on the rich and investors, more regulation of businesses and spending programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wall Street prefers  political &quot;gridlock&quot; where legislative decisions related to trade, immigration, taxes, health care and regulation are made with input from both  parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A split chamber probably delivers the gridlock the market prefers,&quot; says Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist for Janney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. POST-ELECTION VIOLENCE OR SCANDAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since World War II stocks have risen 2%, on average, from Election Day until year-end, thanks to the lifting of  uncertainty, according to CFRA, an independent stock and fund research firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what happens if uncertainty doesn't lift once the votes are counted? Or if violence breaks out, as 51% of voters fear, according to a recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll? How would investors react if Clinton wins but her legal troubles related to use of a personal email server while secretary of State worsen and spark a post-election crisis? What if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wins and the more than six dozen pending lawsuits now open against him and his company are tried while he's president, or if his controversial policies on trade and immigration get fast-tracked, or his claims of a rigged election gain traction?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Consumer confidence often increases after a presidential election, but perhaps not this time since both candidates are viewed as so flawed and unlikable,&quot; says Gregory Valliere, chief strategist at Horizon Investments. &quot;If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (loses and) proclaims the election is rigged, perhaps a quarter of all Americans may agree with him. That's hardly a prescription for higher consumer confidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence in the aftermath of the election, if it occurs, is viewed as a short-term hiccup. &quot;If it (violence) was widespread and had economic consequences, such as consumers staying home and not spending, it could (impact markets),&quot; Luschini says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adds Luskin: &quot;Markets are not typically rattled by violence in the streets. Remember 1968 -- riots, assassinations, shootings all over the world -- stocks just went higher and higher, through it all.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
