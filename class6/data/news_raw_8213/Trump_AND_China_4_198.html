<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About the only person Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hasn't insulted in his march toward the Republican presidential nomination is Ronald Reagan. But he'd surely find fault with Reagan on the subject of trade deficits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our 40th president said they are not necessarily a bad thing. Trade deficits show, Reagan said, that the U.S. economy is strong, and that the American people have money to spend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, by contrast, calls them terrible and a sign that we're &quot;losing.&quot; Countries that have trade surpluses with us are ripping us off at every turn, in his view.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No. 1 culprit is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The way he talks, you'd think the Chinese are 10 feet tall and much more clever than we are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his premise is wrong. The U.S. has far better long-term economic prospects than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which means President Obama was in a position of strength when he met Thursday with President Xi Jinping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who's No. 1?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one denies that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been cheating when it comes to trade. The World Trade Organization has sided with the United States in at least three major cases in recent years, cases in which Washington accused Beijing of employing illegal trade tactics. No less a free trader than Obama himself has slapped anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese goods to protect American jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our trade deficit with the People's Republic last year hit a record $366 billion -- a cool $1 billion a day. Even so, that's well below </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> exaggerated figure of &quot;over $500 billion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, it is not evidence that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is &quot;winning,&quot; as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> likes to say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is really winning, then why have global business executives said the USA is the best place in the world in which to invest and do business? The AT Kearney Foreign Direct Investment Confidence survey says America &quot;takes first place for the third straight year, as it leads all countries in terms of macroeconomic outlook. Forty-six percent say they are more optimistic about the U.S. economy's outlook than they were a year ago, and only 10% say they are more pessimistic.&quot; Executives were less cheerful about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is winning, then why do more U.S. manufacturing executives say that from now until 2020, they are more likely to add factory capacity here than in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? And why do increasing numbers of them say they are now bringing jobs back?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> winning, then why are the wealthiest and savviest Chinese bailing on their own country?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Follow the money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bank of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Hurun (a marketing group that tracks wealthy Chinese) said in 2013 that more than half of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> millionaires want to leave or have taken steps to do so. Other studies say they've already moved $658 billion out, a figure that could double by the end of this year. When your best and brightest are racing for the exits, is that, to use </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> binary way of thinking, winning or losing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's follow the money in another way that also undercuts </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic patriotism. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is pouring investment capital into the USA: nearly $16 billion last year, up 30% from 2014. The Rhodium Group, which tracks all this, says close to $2 billion was for &quot;greenfield&quot; projects: brand new manufacturing facilities built from scratch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is attracted to the United States for all the right reasons: a skilled labor force, low cost of energy, minimal bureaucracy (if you disagree with this, you've never been to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), property rights and contract enforcement. The fact is, for an increasing number of Chinese investors, Adam Smith and John Locke &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Karl Marx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why does </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> think </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is so smart and we're so dumb? I say the opposite is true. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has an environmental crisis on its hands, and its economy is slowing rapidly. As its wages rise, millions of manufacturing jobs are leaving, as other countries do to it what it did to us. Beijing's communist bosses are so afraid of their own citizens that they employ a cyber army of 2 million to block social media and crimp the free exchange of threatening ideas. This is not the sign of a confident government embracing the future; it's a sign of a fearful one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> read on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is based on a simplistic emphasis on its strengths that ignores its many weaknesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will worry me? When it stops investing in America. It's great that foreigners have confidence in us -- more, it seems, than do some of our own would-be leaders.</SPAN></P>
