<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know you're gonna have to face it, you're addicted to love,&quot; Robert Palmer sang back in 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, you know you're gonna have to face it: There's a  strong likelihood that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be the Republican presidential candidate in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> big win in Nevada on Tuesday night, his third in a row, sinks in, it's time -- past time -- to end the denial.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months, the belligerent billionaire has been riding high in  ubiquitous polls and dominating the GOP contest and conversation. But there long has been a strong undercurrent in the politico/media complex narrative that he's not really going to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seemed unthinkable that a flamboyant reality TV star/businessman with no political experience, a penchant for the insulting and the outrageous, no apparent policy chops and absolutely no respect for the rules of the game could become one of two finalists to become Leader of the Free World.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But just as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a very different candidate, we're dealing with a very different electorate this time around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has made preposterous statement after preposterous statement -- rapists from Mexico, McCain's not a war hero, blood coming out of her whatever, thousands of New Jersey Muslims celebrating 9/11 -- there were confident predictions that this, at last, would blow up the juggernaut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But remarks that would have ended the campaigns of lesser mortals slowed The Donald not at all. Even ripping former Republican president George W. Bush's Iraq war with the fervor of a committed lefty was a non-event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there was the grudging notion that OK, maybe this bull in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">china</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shop is resonating with a significant slice of the electorate, but that doesn't necessarily translate into votes at the polls, a view that was reinforced briefly by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> second-place finish in Iowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But since then the mogul has run the table, winning handily in three very different locales -- New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada -- in both the primary and caucus format.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been -- and still is -- talk that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can be stopped once the field is winnowed and the &quot;establishment&quot; can rally behind a single anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This remains theoretically possible, but I wouldn't bet the craft beer money on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bunched closely together far behind </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, who have battled each other furiously. Neither shows any sign of going away anytime soon. But what if one of them does? It's not as if Cruz supporters are going to bolt to Rubio en masse. And if it's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> v. Cruz, for what's left of the GOP establishment, they might be checking out one-way airfares to Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio Gov. John &quot;I don't know if my purpose is to be president&quot; Kasich? His small slice of the pie would barely be a speed bump for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> express.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor would a race to the exits by  enigmatic Ben Carson be much of a factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of which is to say that a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nomination is a done deal. Politics, like life, is full of the unexpected, as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> buddy and onetime GOP presidential front-runner Rudy Giuliani and 2008 Democratic mortal lock Hillary Clinton would be glad to tell you. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has had a stranglehold on this race for quite a long time, and it only seems to be tightening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next up  is a CNN debate at the University of Houston on Thursday night moderated by  indefatigable Wolf Blitzer. All eyes, or at least many of them, are likely to be on Cruz, who is reeling from relentless pummeling from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Rubio and Carson (and lots of negative coverage) over his campaign's dirty tricks. Cruz this week ousted his communications director for tweeting a news story falsely suggesting that Rubio had dissed the Bible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also be interesting to see if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has made devastating use of personal attacks on his rivals (see Bush, Jeb!), begins to turn his fire on Rubio, who finished second in the last two contests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate will set the stage for next week's Super Tuesday, aka the SEC primary, which features GOP face-offs in a dozen states, including Cruz's home state of Texas and a cluster of Southern states. It's hard to see a way forward for Cruz if he doesn't have a good day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK, so the impossible happens and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wins the nomination. No way he is making it all the way to the White House, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't be so sure. While the polls are a) hardly Gospel in general, and b) of limited value long before an election matchup takes shape, they are at least a hint. And the averages at Real Clear Politics are hardly reassuring, particularly in the case of Clinton, who at this writing has a margin-of-error lead of 2.8%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there's no question Democratic front-runner Clinton and challenger Sen. Bernie Sanders both have significant vulnerabilities. Clinton has issues of trust and likeability as well as that nagging, ongoing federal investigation of her private email system while she was secretary of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Sanders, there are questions about his foreign policy acumen (although </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reminds no one of Bismarck) and the broader issue of whether Americans would elect a socialist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ladies and gentlemen, fasten your seat belts.</SPAN></P>
