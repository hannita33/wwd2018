<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will get his chance to be  &quot;the greatest jobs president that God ever created,&quot; as he promised during the campaign, but his  path to employment supremacy is shrouded in uncertainty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican real-estate baron and reality TV star's ascension to the White House caps a campaign that featured his pledge to spark a massive increase in employment and to lure manufacturing jobs back from overseas. He struck a chord with working-class white voters who flocked to the polls to back him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our thesis this year was, 'angry' is the new hope -- largely on the idea that the lack of economic growth was generating anger among the voters themselves,&quot; said Dan Clifton, head of policy research for market research firm Strategas. &quot;What we're seeing is a great degree of political volatility that has stemmed from this economic volatility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promises to punish U.S. companies for outsourcing work, slap tariffs on certain foreign goods and renegotiate free-trade agreements were among his principal objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether those proposals will  spark job growth -- and whether they're achievable at all -- is debatable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said raising tariffs on imports from countries such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Japan could temporarily boost U.S. jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the long run, &quot;are these policies going to frighten business leaders and investors about the wisdom of U.S. policymaking?&quot; Burtless  asked in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best bet to spark quick job growth might be a bipartisan deal on infrastructure investment, Burtless said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That could include roads, bridges and water pipelines -- areas in which the presidential contenders shared some common ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are currently in a phase where public investment in infrastructure has been declining,&quot; Burtless said. &quot;If you think the country really does have a lot of underemployment, it does seem a strange time to scale back infrastructure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic advisers floated a proposal last month that would provide tax credits to investors who acquire infrastructure bonds, arguing that $167billion in private investments could spark $1 trillion in infrastructure investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, &quot;if he pays for this infrastructure boost by gutting spending elsewhere, he'll ruin the job creation impact,&quot; said Josh Bivens, director of research and policy for the Economic Policy Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although infrastructure spending might help at home, it won't bring back any jobs from overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One pragmatic way to fight back against globalization is to bolster education of highly skilled workers at home. The USA is trailing on that front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In India, growth in the number of people with &quot;higher skills&quot; is projected at 14.6% from 2015 through 2020, compared with 11.2% for the USA during that period, according to market research firm Euromonitor International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rhetoric has been aimed squarely at the impact of trade on the U.S. economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the campaign, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decried the North American Free Trade Agreement that hastens economic activity between the USA, Mexico and Canada. He blasted companies such as Dearborn, Mich.-based automaker Ford Motor for launching plants in Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any concerted effort to block foreign trade could trip up the economy, economists have said. <BR></SPAN></P>
