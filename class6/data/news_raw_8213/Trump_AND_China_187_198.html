<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic presidential ticket took a victory lap through the Midwest after what was, by and large, a successful convention. But the three-day bus tour also illustrated Hillary Clinton's challenges in closing the deal with voters who have a deep-seated mistrust of Washington.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's blue campaign bus, emblazoned with her &quot;Stronger Together&quot; slogan, traveled a couple hundred miles, including along the Appalachian Mountain ridge in western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio, rolling past Dollar Stores, bowling alleys, red-painted barns and dilapidated wooden homes with porches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the rural communities where there's a current of anger over the 20-year decline of the nation's middle class. The resentment stems from trade agreements championed by both parties as well as political elites they feel are corrupt and have abandoned the country's heartland while enriching themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Harrisburg, Pa., to Youngstown, Clinton sought to make a personal connection with voters while touting her economic plan, which calls for the biggest investment in jobs since World War II. She shared the story of her grandfather, who did &quot;dangerous&quot; work in a Scranton, Pa., lace mill, and pledged to &quot;fight&quot; for those who feel &quot;left behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a lot of people in our country who are frustrated, they feel like maybe the economy has passed them by, their government doesn't help them, that nobody is listening and nobody cares about them,&quot; she said in Pittsburgh. &quot;I get that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton also said GOP presidential nominee Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has &quot;zero&quot; economic plans while pointing to his business record of manufacturing his branded products in such places as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Bangladesh. &quot;The only thing he makes in America are bankruptcies, both his own and for the people who do business with him,&quot; Clinton said in Hatfield, Pa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet her challenge here is demonstrated by the fact that even some local Democrats say their party shares in the blame for rural America's economic and social plight. Johnstown, where Clinton visited a steel-wire manufacturer, exemplifies the regions drifting away from the Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you come to towns like Johnstown, where they have bled manufacturing jobs the past 30 years, where they have the highest poverty rate in the state&quot; and a heroin epidemic, &quot;they are really suffering,&quot; said Erin McClelland, a Democrat running to represent Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They feel the Democratic Party has abandoned them, talks down to them, calls them stupid,&quot; she said. <BR></SPAN></P>
