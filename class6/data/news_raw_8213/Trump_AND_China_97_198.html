<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Western Europe gears up for a string of elections over the next year, right-wing parties are seizing on Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory as proof that a strong nationalistic stance against trade and immigration will propel them into power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A wave of populism already has spread to Eastern Europe, where countries that include Croatia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia have rightist  governments.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farther west, Austria next month could elect Europe's first far-right head of state since World War II. Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party narrowly lost a race for the largely ceremonial post in April, but a new election was ordered because of alleged irregularities in counting mailed ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France, Germany and the Netherlands, which hold general elections in 2017, also have seen a U.S.-style shift in support from mainstream parties to anti-establishment nationalists. The trend comes amid growing anxiety over weak job prospects tied to globalization, as well as a migrant crisis seen as a threat to security and a drain on social welfare benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Europeans blame the problems on decades of membership in the European Union, which they feel is oblivious to their concerns about the free flow of labor and migration within the 28-nation bloc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are sick and tired of politicians who refused to listen to their worries about rising immigration, the loss of law and order, taxes being spent abroad while domestic needs are rising, trade agreements that harm employment at home,&quot; said Geert Wilders, a Dutch lawmaker and leader of the Netherlands' far-right Party for Freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are witnessing a Patriotic Spring, in America as well as in Europe,&quot; he told USA TODAY. &quot;Our people have the same worries as the American people. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory proves that change is possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wouter Dol of the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy, a group that helps young democracies organize elections, said Wilders paints himself as a political outsider like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> despite being a seasoned politician with more than a decade of lawmaking experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Netherlands</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilders is expected to mount a serious challenge to Prime Minister Mark Rutte's conservative-liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy in March elections. &quot;The traditional parties have not been sensing the temperature of society very well,&quot; said Dol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> backers identify with his vow to reject the political elite and take back control of American institutions and policy that he claims have been undermined by years of corrupt and inefficient government. &quot;The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declared in his victory speech early Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is part of a worldwide phenomenon. It's in the U.S., Europe, but also in Russia, Turkey, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; said Michael Wohlgemuth, director of the Berlin office of Open Europe, a research organization. &quot;There's pretty much a similar pattern everywhere you look, and a lot of it is about identity politics,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those shocks could come in France next spring. Polls in French media show Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, will comfortably sail into the second round of a presidential election for the first time, although she might not emerge the ultimate winner. &quot;Nothing is immutable,&quot; Le Pen said after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> win. Her father, party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, said on Twitter: &quot;Today, the United States, tomorrow France.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approval ratings for France's current president, socialist Fran&cedil;ois Hollande, are abysmal in the wake of a string of terror attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel must call an election before October, Wohlgemuth from Open Europe said that despite recent gains in state and local elections by the right-wing and anti-EU Alternative f&uuml;r Deutschland party (AfD), Germans are unlikely to vote to &quot;pull up the draw-bridge&quot; next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nationalism and Germany in a post-World War II world do not go together very well,&quot; he said. &quot;You won't see AfD as part of any government. We believe in principles and values and not emotional rhetoric.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronald Gl&auml;ser, a recently elected AfD lawmaker in Berlin, said his party shares some &quot;convictions&quot; with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gl&auml;ser said he hoped </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would make good on a proposal to reduce U.S. forces  around the world and make America more isolationist. &quot;Germans don't want to be spied on by the National Security Agency, and we don't appreciate American wars overseas.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
