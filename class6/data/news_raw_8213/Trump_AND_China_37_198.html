<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ringed by tech's elite, President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Wednesday promised to do &quot;anything we can do&quot; to help the industry he often baited during the presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is truly an amazing group of people,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower to kick off a meeting with Silicon Valley's top leaders. &quot;I want to add that I'm here to help you folks do well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A dozen tech A-listers -- Apple CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, among them -- sat down for the two-hour meeting with the president-elect to discuss jobs, immigration policy, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cybersecurity and taxes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told the group his administration is &quot;going to be here for you. You'll call my people, you'll call me. We have no formal chain of command around here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He suggested, and tech leaders agreed to, meeting quarterly, according to a person briefed on the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They discussed repatriating foreign profits, reforming taxes and regulations so companies build more jobs in the U.S., building better infrastructure and improving education, the person briefed on the meeting said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government procurement and protecting intellectual-property rights, major topics for several tech companies in attendance, also came up, according to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cook and Musk were scheduled to meet privately with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> later. Notably absent, however, was Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who invented what possibly is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> favorite app. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg did not attend, but Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants the tech industry &quot;to keep going with the incredible innovation,&quot; he said on live television. &quot;There's nobody like you in the world. There's nobody like the people in this room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was flanked by Vice President-elect Mike Pence and venture capitalist Peter Thiel, one of his few vocal supporters in Silicon Valley. Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft declined comment. Bezos, however, struck a conciliatory tone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I shared the view that the administration should make innovation one of its key pillars, which would create a huge number of jobs across the whole country, in all sectors, not just tech --  everywhere,&quot; he said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting, roughly one month before the billionaire real-estate tycoon is sworn in as the 45th president, could offer an early litmus test on how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans to bring jobs  to the Rust Belt and other non-tech regions. The attendees represent more than 1.3 million U.S. jobs and a total market cap of $2.9 trillion, according to the Consumer Technology Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, the consumer tech sector generated $3.5 trillion in economic output and accounted for more than 15 million people, or 8.4% of total U.S. employment, CTA says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One area where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and tech agree: reforming the tax code. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says he plans to slash the corporate tax rate to 15% from 35%, which could prompt tech giants to repatriate money kept overseas. There could also be common ground over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> anti-regulatory policies, which might aid start-ups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his year-long sprint to the presidency, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has traded barbs with the industry. While President Obama frequently visited Silicon Valley and hosted tech executives at the White House, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> engaged in tweet-bashing Apple and Amazon, disparaging their off-shoring of jobs, stances on encryption and tax contributions. Dozens of executives, meanwhile, signed an open letter opposing his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly all represented large, traditional companies with the exception of Palantir Technologies, the private software and services company co-founded by  Thiel. Thiel, Kushner and Priebus organized the gathering of tech executives Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Wednesday, Musk and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick were added to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strategic and Policy Forum, which had been noticeably absent of tech leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is our president for the next four years, so the tech community needs to set aside its intellectual arrogance and move forward with him to maintain its pre-eminence as an industry,&quot; says Vineet Jain, CEO of start-up Egnyte, an enterprise file-sharing and collaboration provider. &quot;He's a businessman; I don't think he will do anything to jeopardize (the tech industry).&quot;</SPAN></P>
