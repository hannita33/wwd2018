</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the past year, the tech industry shunned Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and he shamed it. Now, the president-elect and the $2.9 trillion sector find themselves thrust into a shotgun marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Much of the business is in a wait-and-see mode,&quot; says Meg Whitman, CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, one of the largest tech companies in the world and a Hillary Clinton supporter. &quot;We adapt and make the most of the situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in tech supported Clinton, and they expected her to win. With </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as president-elect, they are hastily revising plans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One difficulty: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has no discernible tech plan nor has he openly courted tech executives. For those in Silicon Valley and beyond, he is the great unknown, and his potential Cabinet is creating fears of restrictions on skilled immigrant workers, weakened cybersecurity, punishing tariffs on products made in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and unrelenting pressure to bring  manufacturing jobs to the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of the planning (by tech companies) had been done under the assumption that Hillary would win,&quot; says Deven Parekh, managing director at Insight Venture Partners. &quot;There was a big transition team for her ready to go, which included technology-related issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has made for an uneasy climate, but tech executives and trade associations say they've accepted the election results and want to work with Team </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, voted for Clinton after supporting Republican candidates in the last four presidential elections. He welcomes working with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration but doesn't know what to expect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We reached out to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Clinton, and we didn't get a response from him. Am I concerned? Of course I'm concerned,&quot; says Shapiro, whose trade organization represents more than 2,200 companies, including Amazon, Uber and Apple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people he reached out to were not in tech, but in flyover territory,&quot; Shapiro says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, there is overlap between Silicon Valley and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team, with its ties to real estate, venture funding and other businesses. A main connector? Peter Thiel. The influential venture capitalist and Facebook board member donated $1.25 million to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign. He was a delegate for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and spoke at the Republican National Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thiel doesn't have a formal role during the transition but has spent nearly two weeks advising the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investor isn't the valley's only link to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but he appears to be its strongest one. Joe Lonsdale, founding partner at 8VC, a Silicon Valley-based tech investment fund, has his own connections to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> camp as well as strong ties to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spokesperson was unavailable for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Driving tech executives to find a receptive ear in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration is a platform that was generally unfriendly to the tech industry. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> populist message of restrictive immigration, manufacturing in America, privacy and hard-line stance on trade agreements is of paramount concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversely, his views on reduced taxation and regulation could benefit an industry with which he is a stranger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Absent a tech plan, we need to look at his stances on immigration, taxation and privacy and extrapolate how it applies to tech,&quot; says Lee Tien, senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. &quot;That's a risky proposition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along his improbable journey, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has blasted Amazon for not paying enough taxes and a surrogate of his skewered Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for perceived anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple, in particular, could be in the crosshairs of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration. Over the past year, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has chastised Apple and other hardware makers to build more products in the U.S. instead of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. As a candidate, he demanded a boycott of Apple when it didn't cave to the FBI's request to hack the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, as has been the case with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the candidate vs. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the president-elect, was it just posturing in a pre-emptive negotiating tactic?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates called him after his election but declined to say what they talked about, according to a meeting he had with The New York Times last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The underlying contempt for elitism, as personified by West Coast-based companies with high-intellect founders and socially conscious CEOs, was articulated by White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia. The issue now is about Americans looking to not get (expletive) over. If we deliver,&quot; Bannon said. &quot;That's what the Democrats missed. They were talking to these people with companies with a $9 billion market cap employing nine people. It's not reality. They lost sight of what the world is about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thinly-veiled swipe at unicorns offers another layer of uncertainty in Silicon Valley, tech pockets throughout the U.S. and the Beltway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's spent a lot of time on Twitter but hasn't said much about tech during the campaign,&quot; says Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., a former Microsoft executive. &quot;We need a conversation about tech and government's use of tech. It won't happen without input from the tech community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DelBene, who has worked closely with Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., another tech alumnus, is hopeful the new administration does not derail progress on bipartisan tech issues such as privacy and the Internet of Things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concern is palpable from an industry that has felt the wrath of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweets and unpredictability..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ITI CEO Dean Garfield, whose organization represents more than 60 tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft and Facebook, is optimistic about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vow to invest up to $1 trillion into infrastructure. It could be a boon for Internet of Things devices such as sensors for roadways that enable driverless cars to interact and communicate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A much-rumored bipartisan infrastructure plan that could bring jobs to the Rust Belt might involve tech companies, Garfield and Shapiro say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, Speaker Ryan supported an infrastructure plan by Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) in which hundreds of billions of dollars would be raised through a one-time &quot;repatriation&quot; of profits from big companies' overseas earnings in exchange for lower tax rates.</SPAN></P>
