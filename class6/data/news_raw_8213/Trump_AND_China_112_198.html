<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who made criticism of foreign trade deals a major theme of his presidential campaign, said Tuesday he is nominating former Reagan administration official Robert Lighthizer to be his new U.S. trade representative.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lighthizer, 69, &quot;has extensive experience striking agreements that protect some of the most important sectors of our economy and has repeatedly fought in the private sector to prevent bad deals from hurting Americans,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in a statement. &quot;He will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many Americans of prosperity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A critic of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade practices in particular, Lighthizer said he is &quot;fully committed to President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mission to level the playing field for American workers and forge better trade policies, which will benefit all Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years, Lighthizer has worked on trade issues as a partner with the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made the announcement while preparing for another day of briefings and jobs interviews at his Manhattan office tower. The president-elect also stayed busy on social media. In a flurry of new tweets, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questioned House Republicans for gutting a congressional ethics investigating committee, tweeting that the GOP should focus on issues like tax reform and health care; however, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also described the independent ethics committee's work as &quot;unfair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Threatened General Motors -- and presumably other companies -- with the imposition of a &quot;border tax&quot; over operations in Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again pledged to dismantle President Obama's health care plan, saying it &quot;just doesn't work, and it is not affordable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in the week, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans to receive a special security briefing on allegations that Russia orchestrated the hacking of Democratic officials during last year's presidential election, aides said. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is awaiting a final report being developed by intelligence agencies at Obama's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the jobs he plans to fill in the coming days: director of National Intelligence, secretary of Agriculture and secretary of Veterans Affairs. <BR></SPAN></P>
