<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before last Friday, many Americans paid scant attention to the vote in the United Kingdom, on the far side of a big ocean, over whether to pull out of the European Union or stay put.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That all changed when Britain shocked the world by voting to leave. Global financial markets tumbled, dragging down Americans' retirement accounts with them. Prime Minister David Cameron announced he would resign in a few months, and Scottish officials pressed for another vote on breaking with the UK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, many Britons had good reason to loathe the EU. It has a stupefying bureaucracy, it coddles debt-laden countries such as Greece, and its 28-member structure makes for a kitchen with too many cooks. But the negative consequences of the &quot;Brexit&quot; vote are hard to overestimate. Britain, or what is left of it, will be considerably more isolated and marginalized. That's not good news for it, or for the United States, which counts the UK an important strategic ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An EU without Britain, the world's fifth largest economy, will be less market-oriented and less amenable to American positions. A Britain without the EU will struggle to remain relevant on issues such as combating terrorism, standing up to Russia and finding an appropriate relationship between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brexit supporters capitalized on the anti-globalization movements that have gained considerable strength in recent years by going after trade, immigration, and to, some degree, technology. In the USA and abroad, and on the left and the right, these movements have tapped into a sense that the change brought by these forces is detrimental.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those on the other side, meanwhile, have found it hard to convince people of the advantages of globalization. But the fallout from the Brexit vote -- political turmoil, an instant 11% shrinkage in the British economy measured in U.S. dollars, and a potential 11% reduction in the UK population if Scotland and Northern Ireland leave -- demonstrates the price to be paid for disengagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are lessons from Britain's vote for the United States. Fortunately, Americans don't need to chose between a foreign-based bureaucracy or turning inward. But they do need to know that erecting immigration and trade walls (literal or figurative), in a nationalistic backlash against globalization, is bad business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration reform in this country would be a boon to the U.S. economy, as undocumented workers come out of the shadows to start businesses, go to school, take more demanding jobs and pay taxes. Yet reform remains bottled up in Congress, while a much-needed trade deal with 11 Pacific rim countries faces highly uncertain prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Party, for its part, appears set to nominate a virulently anti-trade, anti-immigration presidential candidate in Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in Scotland on Friday to visit his golf course in Turnberry, quickly drew &quot;a big parallel&quot; between Brexit and his own campaign. &quot;I love to see people take their country back,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters on this side of the pond would do well to look at the turmoil created by the vote in the UK. In a complex and vibrant world, isolation is never  good. <BR></SPAN></P>
