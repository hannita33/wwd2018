</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate before the debate began was all about which Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would show up on stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provocative </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who unexpectedly claimed the Republican presidential nomination over a dozen rivals with stronger political r&eacute;sum&eacute;s? Or Presidential </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who in recent weeks has toned down his rhetoric and, in another political surprise, managed to pull even with rival Hillary Clinton in national and battleground polls?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the opening question, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repeated his signature, dire view of the state of the nation. &quot;We have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us,&quot; he said, decrying the threat from Mexico and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have to stop our jobs from leaving the United States and with it firing all our people.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's response to the first question reflected her signature devotion to policy, working in bullet-point references to infrastructure investment, a higher minimum wage, equal pay for women, profit-sharing for workers, paid family leave, earned sick days, affordable child care and debt-free college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And she criticized Republican economic policies. &quot;I call it Trumped-up trickle-down,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, she said, &quot;Donald thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese; I think it's real.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protested she was wrong, although he tweeted exactly that. And within minutes, they were interrupting one another and talking over one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The setting inside the debate hall at Hofstra University looked dignified enough to fit in the White House itself, with a dark blue backdrop, a discrete band of white stars and a depiction of a golden eagle soaring over the two contenders. But the mood surrounding the opening forum was almost gladitorial, reaching Super Bowl-size levels of hype.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No presidential election in modern times has defied the conventional wisdom as much this one, which has ended up pitting a political neophyte and reality-TV star against the wife of a former president, a member of the family that defines the Democratic establishment. And no presidential debate in the television age has been more hotly anticipated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time of the campaign, they were face-to-face, side-by-side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They walked out from opposite sides of the stage, Clinton in a red jacket and slacks, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a gray suit and bright blue tie. They shook hands, greeted the moderator, and retreated to the podiums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hours before the debate, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did needle Clinton on Twitter, a platform he has perfected as a political weapon. &quot;My team of deplorables will be managing my Twitter account for this evenings debate,&quot; he wrote, a reference to her description at a fundraiser of his followers as a &quot;basket of Deplorables.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton was tweeting about the same time: &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told 31 outright lies just last week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those jibes might not seem to have set the landscape for a debate focused on the challenge of overhauling America's tax system or the imperative to devise fresh approaches to the civil war in Syria. Indeed, much of the attention was focused on whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could project restraint for a full 90 minutes, and whether Clinton convincingly could convey a sense of trustworthiness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">History demonstrates that the opening debate can be powerful enough to boost a candidate (John Kennedy in 1960, Ronald Reagan in 1980) or wound one, with lasting consequences (Michael Dukakis in 1988, Al Gore in 2000). Eleven campaigns have included debates in the television age, since John Kennedy shined against Richard Nixon in 1960. Being seen as the winner of the first debate hasn't guaranteed a victory in November. But in nine of the 11, it shaped the trajectory of the campaign that followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They typically have had the most impact when an incumbent president isn't running, and when a candidate comes in with something to prove, and when the contest is close and fluid. That is, in a campaign like this one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First debates are powerful because it's a time when some voters begin to pay close attention. At an hour-and-a-half, the conversation is more extended and more grueling than any 30-second hour or 10-minute interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ninety minutes is a long time. So is four years. <BR></SPAN></P>
