<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke by phone Monday with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, whom he praised as a strong leader during the U.S. presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the call, the two leaders discussed a range of issues including the threats and challenges facing the United States and Russia, strategic economic issues and the historical U.S.-Russia relationship that dates back over 200 years,&quot; the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team said in a statement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke late Sunday with another key world leader: Chinese President Xi Jinping. They agreed to meet &quot;at any early date,&quot; according to statements from both camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Putin, a statement from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> camp said, &quot;The leaders established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another, and President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stated that he believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin congratulated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and pledged to build &quot;dialogue with the new administration on the principles of equality, mutual respect and non-interference in the internal affairs of each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. and Russian leaders also agreed to set up a face-to-face meeting soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men &quot;agreed to assess the current very poor state of Russian-American relations&quot; and to work for &quot;constructive cooperation on a wide range of issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton criticized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over his praise of Putin during the campaign. She and other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> critics pointed to a U.S. intelligence assessment that Russian interests were behind the hackings of Democrat Party members and may have tried to influence the U.S. elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putin denied the allegations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also expressed skepticism, and said the United States should seek better relations with Putin and Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kremlin said that Putin and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;agreed to continue contacts on the phone and in the future to provide for a personal meeting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> team said that he &quot;noted to President Putin that he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
