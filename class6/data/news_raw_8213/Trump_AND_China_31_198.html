<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political ascendancy of billionaire businessman Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his anticipated clash for the White House with Hillary Clinton is fraught with risk for Wall Street, which fears a surprise presidential win for the upstart </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> due to his unpredictability. But it worries even more about the prospect of the former first lady winning by a landslide and paving the way for the Democrats to regain full control of Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, the stock market hasn't really reacted to the 2016 presidential race, despite a contentious primary season punctuated by potential policy shifts by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> related to trade and immigration that could shake markets, such as picking a fight with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over trade or building a wall along the Mexican border or replacing current Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. Wall Street is also facing the ongoing populist challenge from Bernie Sanders, which has kept his anti-Wall Street message in the news and extended Clinton's fight for the nomination.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my opinion, we haven't seen the markets react at all,&quot; says Greg Valliere, chief strategist, at Horizon Investments. &quot;The market still has a sanguine view.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason for the market's wait-and-see approach to Election 2016 is that Wall Street thinks the most benign outcome -- one of three election scenarios -- is the most likely outcome. And that is Hillary Clinton, a well-known entity not prone to surprises, is seen winning the White House, but the Republicans retaining control of the House of Representatives despite a good chance of ceding control of the Senate back to the Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's the kind of gridlock markets could live with,&quot; Valliere told USA TODAY. If Clinton's power is checked by Republicans, it's unlikely the planks of her platform -- which are similar to President Obama's, such as increased business regulation, boosting taxes on investments like capital gains, staying tough on banks, moving toward price controls in the drug industry -- will get passed into law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Her agenda,&quot; Valliere says, &quot;will hit a brick wall with the GOP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One big risk is if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, underestimated since Day 1 in the presidential race, actually takes the White House. &quot;Investors believe that there is more risk associated with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; says Andy Laperriere, head of U.S. policy research for Cornerstone Macro in Washington, D.C. He ticks off three reasons why </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might be bearish for stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has gone on record saying </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not playing fair in the global game of trade and, as a result, has said he will slap tariffs on Chinese imports to the United States. His more insular-looking, America-first policy could spook global investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could start a trade war,&quot; Laperriere says. &quot;One area  that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has conviction on is trade. If he were to impose a 30% or 40% tariff on Chinese goods, and put tariffs on imports from other countries like Japan and Mexico, it could have a pretty dire impact on the economy and be extremely disruptive to certain countries and sectors of the global economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> off-the-cuff remarks on economic matters also could spook markets, adds Charles Gabriel, president of Capital Alpha Partners. &quot;I think we have brewing the beginnings of swirling risks for markets,&quot; Gabriel says, adding that Wall Street's angst will rise if either  Clinton looks like she will win by a landslide or if investors think </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has a real shot at winning.</SPAN></P>
