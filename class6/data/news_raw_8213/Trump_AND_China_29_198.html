<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it is bargaining with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over trade, forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall or getting along with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asserts that he can &quot;win&quot; based on his negotiating skills. He lays out a series of bargaining strategies -- &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cards&quot; -- in Chapter 2 of his 1987 book with Tony Schwartz, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: The Art of the Deal, and says they have made him a success in real estate and other business dealings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how applicable are they to the world of international politics and diplomacy? Many of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> principles are standard negotiation practice taught in university classes and business seminars. Missing, however, are the more subtle arguments that a president needs to understand to operate on the global stage:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think big. Going for a home run (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> analogy) can pay off. It can also lead to a strikeout. When a pitcher (your opponent) has your number, you are better off going for the single (reining in your ambitions). </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fatally flawed quick fixes for large problems are instructive. They include  plans to solve the national debt by negotiating better terms with creditors (in essence claiming banktruptcy),  the immigration problem by deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants, and  terrorism by keeping Muslims out of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Be focused or single-minded. Keeping your eyes on the prize is good. The problem is that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not distinguish between the prize and the process. Unwavering dedication to negotiating positions, such as insisting that Mexico pay for a border wall, is a recipe for impasse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protect the downside and maximize options. Though fallback positions and expanded options can prevent caving in for bad deals, they can also steer the process away from good compromises. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lack of dependence on other nations and international organizations enables him to criticize what he views as &quot;bad&quot; deals. The problem is that he risks alienating these critical allies, who would view him as a loose cannon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Use your leverage. Negotiating power is an asset, but it can also embolden weaker parties. Long ago, Thomas Schelling introduced us to the &quot;paradox of weakness.&quot; Reacting to the power asymmetry, weak parties can increase their leverage by reducing their dependence on stronger opponents, developing alternative alliances and reframing the issues. Mexico might be tempted to do this, given </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rhetoric on trade and immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reframe. Good idea, especially when stuck in an impasse. The problem is that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> take on the term is manipulative. For example, he writes that &quot;a little hyperbole never hurts,&quot; and reframes the phrase &quot;truthful hyperbole&quot; as an &quot;innocent form of exaggeration.&quot; That is not useful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Get the word out.  In his  campaign, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shows that even negative publicity generates support. But is this good advice for diplomats? The most ambitious  global agreements -- the recent Cuba talks, the 1990s Oslo Accords that produced a breakthrough in Israeli-Palestinian relations, practically all the successful peace and arms control deals -- were negotiated privately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fight back. For </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who keeps track of who is &quot;nice&quot; or &quot;mean&quot; to him, fighting back is usually on behalf of himself. Imagine negotiators fighting back at each other. They'd be on a collision course where neither gains anything and the focus is misdirected to personal rather than substantive concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deliver the goods. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sees himself as a man of action and is not overly concerned about the impact of his policies. Many of his ideas could create new problems, such as a trade war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, even as he was flaunting his image as a doer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rely on your instincts. Now this is bad advice, not because intuition is always misleading but because it defies the odds. The chances for negotiation success are improved when analysis is used to support intuition. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mentions that he learns from his own &quot;random&quot; surveys. It is not clear that he understands the meaning of random sampling, and he appears to reject empirical evidence based on data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> perceives  that life is a game to be won while having fun keeping score. Effective presidents understand that conflicts are problems to be solved. They know the value of fostering  relationships with adversaries. Patience, perspective and empathy are essential skills in a complex world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These realizations seem to elude </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as he moves closer to securing the Republican Party's nomination in Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
