<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential nominee Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Monday laid out his economic plan -- a grab bag of tax breaks for households and corporations, fewer regulatory speed bumps for businesses and a bare-knuckled approach to trade policy. Here's a look at how feasible his proposals are and what the impact would be:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cut personal income taxes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to consolidate the seven tax brackets to three and reduce the top rate from 39.6% to 33%. He would likely struggle to get such large tax breaks through even a Republican Congress, which has been bent on slashing the deficit, without some compromise, economist Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics says. If the plan were to pass, the vast majority of the cuts would go to the wealthy, says Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slash corporate taxes. The corporate tax rate would plummet from 35% to 15%, instantly making the U.S. a more desirable location for multinational companies. Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says the move would make the U.S. more competitive as it shifts from being the world's highest-taxing country to among the lowest. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may be going too far. Hufbauer says even a 20% tax rate would put the U.S. in that highly competitive group. And Zandi says the proposal's major flaw is that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not specified how he would pay for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cut taxes for small businesses. Many small businesses now pay their personal tax rate for so-called pass-through business income. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to slash that rate to 15% as well. But more than two-thirds of pass-through income goes to the top 1% of tax filers, Marr says, providing another windfall to the wealthy. And, he says, many would game the system, finding ways to file  as small businesses to take advantage of the lower rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scrap the carried interest loophole. This rule allows investment fund partners to treat their income as capital gains, taxing the money at significantly lower rates. Getting rid of a loophole that many experts regard as unfair would appear to create a new income stream. But Marr says many fund partners would simply try to have the money taxed at the even lower pass-through rate for small businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cut regulations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says he would place a moratorium on all new agency regulations and eliminate other rules, including for energy companies. While the proposal could be a boon for  investment, Zandi says it can't be judged because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not specified which regulations would be abolished, making it impossible to assess the costs against the benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kill the Trans-Pacific Partnership and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. It would be simple for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to back out of the TPP, as it has not been ratified by Congress, Hufbauer says. But he says it would hurt more than help the U.S., which has fewer trade barriers than other participating countries. And it would hand </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> more control over world trade. The U.S. could seek to renegotiate NAFTA, but it's unclear what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants from Mexico and Canada. There are currently no tariffs on goods traded in North America. The U.S. also could withdraw from the pact by giving six months notice, Hufbauer says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Get tough with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on trade. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says he wants to label </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a currency manipulator, prevent it from stealing U.S. intellectual property and stop the government from subsidizing exports. If it refuses, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he would threaten to impose 45% tariffs on Chinese imports.  A better tactic, Hufbauer says, is more traditional diplomacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repeal the Affordable Care Act. It would be possible if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could get a Republican Congress to go along. That would be unlikely unless lawmakers have a replacement plan that addresses Americans who've gained coverage under the law, says Brian Blase, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. <BR></SPAN></P>
