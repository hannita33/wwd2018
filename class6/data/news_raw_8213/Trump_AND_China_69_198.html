<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton in West Virginia's Democratic primary Tuesday, while Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with no remaining challengers, claimed an easy victory there and in Nebraska among Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a rally in Salem, Ore., following his win, Sanders, a Vermont senator, told supporters &quot;it appears that we won a big, big victory in West Virginia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;West Virginia is a working-class state, and like many other states in this country, including Oregon, working people are hurting,&quot; he said. &quot;And what the people of West Virginia said tonight, and I believe the people of Oregon and Kentucky will say next week, is that we need an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oregon and Kentucky each hold Democratic primaries next Tuesday. Given the Democratic Party's proportional allocation system, Sanders stood to only modestly boost his delegate total with his West Virginia win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Clinton's loss will probably matter little in her battle with Sanders given her large overall delegate lead, it is a powerful reminder of her challenges in a general election match-up with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the presumptive Republican nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West Virginia has a large number of working-class white voters, the demographic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hopes will carry him to victory in Rust Belt states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's performance in West Virginia -- a state she won by a wide margin in the 2008 primaries -- could point to problems with a voting bloc that supported her husband during the more economically prosperous 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These same voters feel left behind as manufacturing jobs have disappeared, and the coal industry has declined amid a shift to cleaner sources of energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vows to bring coal and manufacturing jobs back to depressed pockets of Appalachia by slapping tariffs on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and reworking trade deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alternatively, Clinton's vision is to move these communities to a new generation of jobs, acknowledging a coal industry renaissance is not in the cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech at southeastern Ohio brewery last week, Clinton said coal is still a part of the nation's energy supply, but even big coal-consuming nations such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are starting to burn less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No matter what some politicians tell you, these trends are here to stay,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not a message West Virginians seem to want to hear. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leads Clinton by 27 percentage points in West Virginia, according to a recent Public Policy Polling survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with his performance in West Virginia with white, working-class voters, he's picking up steam in more critical Midwestern swing states that Clinton has to carry in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats have assumed Clinton would beat </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan, which voted twice for Barack Obama and are populated by the blue-collar, union households that have been the Democratic Party's lifeblood for generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet a new Quinnipiac University Swing State Poll shows Clinton and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a dead heat in two of them: Ohio and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton is trying to cast </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a fraud whose rhetoric about helping lower-income Americans does not match his policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday in Louisville, she said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;actually stood on a debate stage and argued that Americans are paid too much, not too little.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In West Virginia, Clinton suffered from her association with Obama, whose policies have accelerated the nation's shift to greener sources of energy without providing a safety net for workers dependent on the coal industry, according to Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat who represents the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been very harmful to the Democratic Party in West Virginia,&quot; Manchin said during a recent Clinton campaign stop in Charleston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the first time faced a cleared field in GOP primaries in West Virginia and Nebraska (Democrats held a caucus there in March) after Ted Cruz and John Kasich ended their campaigns last week. <BR></SPAN></P>
