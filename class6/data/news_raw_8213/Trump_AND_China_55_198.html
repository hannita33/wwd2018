</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's new secretary of Defense nominee has an apparently quite divergent -- and more realistic -- sense of the world than either President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or even, in some respects, the new nominee for national security adviser, retired Army lieutenant general Michael Flynn. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must bring himself to tap these resources before impulse and emotions send the nation off the rails, perhaps irrevocably.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retired Marine general James Mattis sees Russian President Vladimir Putin not through rose-colored glasses but as the autocrat that he is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mattis recognizes the value of our Iran nuclear treaty and rather than ripping it up, he'd prefer to make sure it's enforced to the hilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's also a genuine fan of NATO and believes in force with reason in the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mattis also apparently already talked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> down off the  ledge of waterboarding as an interrogation technique, believing instead in the value of a &quot;pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, there's still so much  unknown about either of the two retired generals  and how they may be used in crises, or in just day-to-day phone calls or tweets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's hope </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> never consulted Flynn or Mattis before taking that perhaps fateful call from Taiwan's president that could push America and Asia further down a path toward conflict that Mattis could be left in the end to sort out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brilliant foreign minister, Wang Yi,  cut </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> some slack -- this one time -- laying the blame for the first direct conversation between a U.S. and Taiwanese president or president-elect in 37 years squarely on Taiwan's new leader, Tsai Ing-Wen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the learning curve is pretty short and steep. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must learn to consult with someone wiser than he is in the world of war and diplomacy. The stakes are enormous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mattis, there's an individual who is deeply experienced and eminently schooled. Unlike </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who is not known to have read any book recently, even one with his name on the cover, Mattis has accumulated a library of more than 7,000 titles. He has even helped write The U.S. Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual with then-Gen. David Petraeus, considered a potential finalist with Mitt Romney for secretary of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is how broadly real wisdom might exist in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration. If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had indeed planned to send a message of a deliberate and strategic pivot to India by taking a call with the prime minister of its neighbor and arch foe Pakistan, or to Beijing in Friday's call with Taiwan, then each should have been preceded by other moves to lay the groundwork so his calls won't be misinterpreted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential transitions have often been used to test us by friends and foes alike. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be wise not to make more foreign moves without consulting experienced hands like Mattis, or his eventual secretary of State.</SPAN></P>
