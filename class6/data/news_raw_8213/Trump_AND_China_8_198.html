<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alibaba executive chairman Jack Ma met with President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Monday to discuss Ma's plans to create 1 million U.S. jobs by growing trade between U.S. small businesses and Chinese consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a great meeting,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told reporters at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower. He also called Ma &quot;a great entrepreneur, one of the best in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He loves this country and he also loves </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. &quot;Jack and I are going to do some great things.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's meeting, which came amid growing tensions between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the incoming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration, focused on the Chinese technology giant's plans to expand in the U.S., especially the Midwest, and strengthening relationships between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the U.S., according to Ma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An editorial in Chinese state media this month warned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that he risked &quot;big sticks&quot; if he starts a trade war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are flowers around the gate of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ministry of Commerce, but there are also big sticks hidden inside the door -- they both await Americans,&quot; the Communist Party's Global Times newspaper wrote in the editorial responding to the appointment of Robert Lighthizer as U.S. trade representative. Lighthizer is a former trade official in the Ronald Reagan administration who has criticized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on trade. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also named Peter Navarro, a UC-Irvine economics professor and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade critic, to run a White House National Trade Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a very productive meeting,&quot; Ma told reporters. &quot;The door is open to discuss the relationship on trade issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ma specifically mentioned agricultural products such as wine and fruit that could be sold through Alibaba to consumers in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of the plan are vague. Alibaba spokesman Robert Christie declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alibaba had previously positioned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a massive market for American goods that could create U.S. jobs but had not pegged how many U.S. jobs it thought that its expansion would create.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, Ma said he envisions 40% of Alibaba's business to be outside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the next 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;$BABA wants to create US jobs by helping US small businesses and farmers sell to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 300 million-strong middle class,&quot; Alibaba tweeted Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ma first outlined the expansion plans in a Wall Street Journal editorial in June 2015. Alibaba aspires to be the digital platform through which all international retailers gain access to Chinese consumers. Alibaba controls about 80% of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> online shopping market with marketplaces such as Taobao and T-Mall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to help U.S entrepreneurs, small-business owners, and brands and companies of all sizes sell their goods to the growing Chinese consumer class. Chinese consumers will get to buy the American products they want. This, in turn, will help create American jobs and increase U.S. exports,&quot; Ma wrote at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the campaign trail, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pledged to limit global trade, taking aim at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Steep tariffs on Chinese goods could undercut Alibaba's AliExpress service, which lets Chinese retailers sell to U.S. consumers and U.S. brands  sell to Chinese consumers. Alibaba last month was placed back on a list of counterfeit marketplaces by the United States Trade Representative over sales on its Taobao marketplace of fake and pirated goods, a move that could also dampen international sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The purpose of Jack Ma's visit was to frame Alibaba's business with the U.S. in a framework Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> understands, as an innovative company that is creating jobs for both Chinese and Americans,&quot; Scott Kennedy, director of the Project on Chinese Business &amp; Political Economy at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, said in an email. &quot;Alibaba's future, in part, will depend on expanding international trade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alibaba has benefited from constraints on foreign companies in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Kennedy said. &quot;My guess is that Alibaba wants to highlight how it is different from Chinese state-owned enterprises. ... However, Alibaba's situation is actually more complex.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
