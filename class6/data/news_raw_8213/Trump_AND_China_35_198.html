<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renaissance, or Armageddon? It depends on whether you love or loathe Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, our against-all-odds, precedent-shattering 45th U.S. president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beginning with the final months of Lyndon Johnson's second term, I've covered nine American presidents. Nothing in nearly a half-century of experience prepared me for the 10th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> upset defies standard political measures. Improbable. Shocking. Unprecedented -- no string of adjectives adequately conveys the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tsunami. American politics, simply, will never be the same again. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has fundamentally altered the business model of American elections. A Republican In Name Only, more or less, he was essentially a minor-party candidate who skillfully engineered a hostile takeover of the GOP, making both major parties look silly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has broken the mold by every imaginable yardstick. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might be the least prepared candidate elected leader of the free world overnight. He has no governmental or military experience, a modest grasp of geopolitics, attention-span challenges and little patience for briefing books or policy papers. He leads with his chin, his gut and blizzards of tweets, sometimes fact-free and ill-advised, that drive his aides nuts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warts and all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has offended so many voter blocs, committed so many head-snapping verbal gaffes, that in another era he would have self-immolated months ago. But for an angry electorate more frightened than hopeful, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, warts and all, was the antidote to more of the same gridlock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His electoral triumph cannot be denied, or minimized. Yes, Hillary Clinton was a poor campaigner, toting decades of political baggage, botching her email problem, and sounding evasive even when telling the truth. Despite her clear organizational and financial advantages and three impressive debate performances, Clinton's flaws were a lethal drag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> often exhibited exponentially greater personal flaws, gleefully trashing women, Hispanics, African Americans, political elites, protesters at his raucous rallies -- anyone who dared criticize him, especially the hated news media. When caught peddling untruths, he doubled down. It didn't matter; he never paid a price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why? As George W. Bush might explain it, the Washington establishment misunderestimated the disgust in the land, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seized upon that national disenchantment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his handlers understood that the politics of rage and grievance would dominate this election. Americans were sick of dysfunctional government, blaming both parties. When House Republican zealots forced an exasperated House Speaker John Boehner to quit, it should have been a wake-up call for the political class. Instead, they wrote </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> off as a billionaire blowhard bully, a certifiable joke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last laugh, of course, was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He was a wildly imperfect messenger, but the only candidate promising to shake up the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how does he govern? He could start with some humility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oftentimes there's a tendency with incoming presidential regimes to believe their triumph, whether huge or modest, confers automatic omniscience, a monopoly on wisdom. Jimmy Carter's Georgians, for instance, took enormous pride in ending what one of them described to me as &quot;eight years of stinking, corrupt Republican rule.&quot; The Obama insurgents, similarly, reveled in vanquishing the vaunted Clinton machine and its personal excesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I detect more than a whiff of that same hubris from the new president -- and especially his we-won, get-over-it handlers. It's understandable, but dangerous. Especially for a president elected with 46.1% of the vote. His electoral triumph, though remarkable, was hardly a mandate. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, and a few million of his &quot;voters&quot; have little use for him; they held their noses because they loathed Clinton more. These voters aren't likely to migrate easily to his agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Open question</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> temperament also remains an open question. Even some Republicans involved in his transition worry he lacks presidential deportment and personal discipline. Since the election, he has dialed back the bombast some, and his dialogues with critics such as Mitt Romney, Bob Gates and Silicon Valley executives are hopeful signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, calling out an Indiana union leader, picking an embarrassing public fight with the entire U.S. intelligence community over Russia's meddling in the election, overturning four decades of bipartisan </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy before taking office and tweeting incendiary, sometimes half-baked pronouncements are troublesome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the campaign, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> halting grasp of policy detail suggested he often didn't know what he didn't know. Now he does -- beginning with his private chats with President Obama, classified foreign-policy briefings and skull sessions with GOP elders and private citizens with serious expertise. Notwithstanding his robust self-confidence, the policy challenges facing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are daunting, and he recognizes it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His relative inexperience requires a steep, swift learning curve -- and a superlative Cabinet and personal staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In assembling a government, presidents must strike a balance between loyalty and competence. Each brings along his share of hacks, toadies, cronies and minor leaguers. The trick is finding harmless slots for the worst and supplementing the most able loyalists with savvy outsiders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Reagan, for example, named longtime California ally Edwin Meese his presidential counselor. But he also installed James Baker, close friend and political confidant to George H.W. Bush, as White House chief of staff. The Californians were livid, but Meese's institutional memory and personal links to Reagan, combined with Baker's organizational prowess and ideological pragmatism, served the new president well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To put it bluntly, each new president must surround himself with the best and the brightest, not the cream of the crap. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has some of both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rex Tillerson at State and James Mattis at Defense are first-rate talents. Some other nominees are considerably less impressive; several are ideologues, picked for their loyalty and shock value -- to rattle and overhaul left-leaning agencies suspicious of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agenda. If history is a guide, some of them, even key West Wing staffers, will wash out by year's end. On-the-job training only works for so long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond implementing his conservative, back-to-the-future vision, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> faces another formidable task -- healing a fractured, deeply divided America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the third divisive president in a row. To succeed, he must reverse that trend promptly. Despite vows to be the president of all and vague pledges to bind up the wounds of a raw election, his thank-you trips to states he won, reprising his raucous campaign rallies, aren't exactly reassuring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like any new president, the 45th deserves every chance to succeed. His presidency is already historic; it's uncertain whether it will lift our spirits or stoke our fears. Anyone who pretends to know is a fool, hack or partisan. Overnight is a lifetime in politics. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has at least 1,461 lifetimes ahead to make his case to a polarized country so desperate for change, it chose the host of The Apprentice to lead it.</SPAN></P>
