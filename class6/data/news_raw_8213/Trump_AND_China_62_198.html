<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, independent presidential candidate Ross Perot predicted the North American Free Trade Agreement would produce a &quot;giant sucking sound&quot; of U.S. jobs fleeing to low-wage Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A quarter-century later, another billionaire businessman, Republican presidential frontrunner Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, is picking up where Perot left off by bashing NAFTA and other trade agreements as bad deals for America and its workers. &quot;I think NAFTA has been a disaster. I think our current deals are a disaster,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told CNN last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, he has been joined  by Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, whose message resonates in states such as Michigan that have lost manufacturing jobs to foreign trading partners ranging from Mexico to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;Our disastrous trade policies for the past 30 or 40 years have had a horrendous impact on the lives of millions of working Americans,&quot; Sanders tweeted March16.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank partly funded by unions, estimated  more than 850,000 jobs have been lost due to NAFTA since the agreement was enacted in 1994. During that time, the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico swung from a $1.7billion U.S. surplus in 1993 to a $61.4billion deficit in 2012, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fair assessment of the impact of free trade requires more than counting the number of lost U.S. jobs, economists say. Opening U.S. borders to imports also lowers prices for consumers and creates jobs for Americans who distribute or sell imports. Trade also fuels economic growth in developing nations, which increases demand for U.S. exports and creates new manufacturing and service jobs in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mauro Guillen, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, doesn't dispute the validity of 850,000 jobs lost because of NAFTA, but said they likely would have disappeared even without that deal. &quot;They would have gone somewhere else. Auto, textiles, toys, consumer electronics, auto parts -- they're also made in Asia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adds Robert Scott, EPI's director of trade and manufacturing policy: &quot;The most important element of trade is who wins and loses. Exports support domestic jobs. Imports displace jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade agreement impacts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOSSES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade deficit with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: Normal trade relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> signed by President Clinton in 2000 and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> membership in the World Trade Organization in 2001 fueled the Asian country's emergence as a powerhouse exporter of manufactured goods. As a result, the U.S. trade deficit with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has grown to $365.7billion in 2015 from $83.8billion in 2000. About 3.5million jobs were lost due to the trade deficit with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, EPI's Scott said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Job loss ripple effect: As manufacturing jobs fade, so do service jobs that support them, such as accounting and legal services, Scott said. &quot;Those services used to be counted as manufacturing jobs,&quot; he said. &quot;The truth is, each manufacturing job supports two additional jobs in the economy.&quot; In all, about 70,000 factories have closed and 5million jobs were lost in manufacturing since 2000 because of trade with Europe, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other countries  now part of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, an agreement among 12 Pacific Rim countries  awaiting congressional approval, Scott said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lower wages: Expanded trade  has suppressed wages, said Josh Bivens, EPI's research and policy director. Annual wages for full-time U.S. workers without a four-year  degree fell about $1,800 in 2011 because of free trade, Bivens wrote in January 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GAINS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lower-priced goods: Imports help to keep prices low, a benefit as wages rise slowly. Middle-class consumers gain &quot;an estimated 29% of their purchasing power from trade,&quot; according to the Council of Economic Advisers. &quot;This is especially important for middle-class consumers who spend a larger share of their disposable income on heavily traded food and clothing items.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More export-created jobs: U.S. companies need more designers and R&amp;D engineers as demand for their products grows in foreign markets. In turn, their suppliers hire more workers. American companies benefit from heightened competition from foreign players in their sectors. About one in four manufacturing jobs are supported by exports, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. And exports supported 6.2million jobs in 2013, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2014, U.S. manufacturing exports reached a record $1.4trillion, and all exports rose by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2014, the Obama administration said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Higher foreign demand: Raising living standards of trading partners means foreign consumers gain buying power to purchase U.S. goods and services, and they spend more when they travel, as evidenced by Chinese tourists flocking to the USA. &quot;The U.S. as a country that's promoting free trade is a good thing,&quot; Guillen said. He said European, Japanese and Korean companies have moved manufacturing facilities to Mexico to be closer to their most important customer, the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 500,000 American jobs &quot;are supported by imports of clothes and toys from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> alone,&quot; according to policy analysts Bryan Riley and Anthony Kim of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less Mexican immigration: NAFTA's role in boosting the Mexican economy has benefited the U.S. by reversing the flood of Mexicans streaming across the border. Mexicans can find more good-paying jobs at home, such as in the auto industry, which has overtaken Japan in the number of vehicles exported to the U.S. By 2020, Mexico will account for about a quarter of all auto vehicles produced in North America, according to IHS Automotive. &quot;In the last couple of years, immigration by Mexicans (to the U.S.) has been negative,&quot; Guillen said, noting the number of Mexicans returning home now exceeds those entering the U.S. &quot;NAFTA has been successful in helping Mexico develop enough to slow that down.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
