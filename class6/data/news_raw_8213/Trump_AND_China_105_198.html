<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American worker is being crushed. Workplace participation for women has declined by more than 3 percentage points since 2000. The percentage of men in their prime working years without a job has nearly tripled since the late 1960s. Median annual household incomes are down more than $4,000 from the beginning of the century.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the factors driving this economic devastation is America's disastrous trade policies.  Under decades of failed leadership, the U.S. has gone from being the globe's manufacturing powerhouse to a rapid deindustrialization that has evaporated entire communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation is about to get  worse if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is not stopped. One of the first casualties  will be America's auto industry, and among the worst victims of this pact will be the people of Ohio. The TPP will send America's remaining auto jobs to Japan. Yet, Gov. John Kasich, Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio have all promoted the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TPP -- a 12-nation pact -- includes Vietnam, which has vastly lower wages than America. Since there is a small market for U.S. goods in Vietnam, this will be an almost entirely one-sided arrangement as thousands of U.S. workers are laid off and production shipped to Vietnam instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Economic Policy Institute (EPI) analysis found that Ohio has  lost more than 100,000 jobs to TPP countries. If the deal is enacted as Kasich has urged, those numbers will skyrocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TPP is the biggest betrayal in a long line of betrayals where politicians have sold out U.S. workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1993, we've lost approximately 900,000 jobs to Mexico alone, pro-labor EPI found. Yet Gov. Kasich voted for NAFTA, just like he now supports TPP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been one of the worst offenders. While promoting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> addition to the World Trade Organization in 2001, the U.S. agreed to permanently confer on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;most favored nation&quot; trading status. EPI estimates that the United States has lost 3 million jobs to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since that decision was made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, since 1997 -- driven by NAFTA and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- the U.S. has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs, EPI analysis shows. We've lost over 80,000 factories during that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am the only candidate who will bring our manufacturing jobs back. I have been warning for decades what would happen if we didn't confront foreign trade cheating, and sadly, my fears have come to pass as the United States has seen its trade deficit in goods soar to $759.3 billion last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we bring back these jobs, and close this trade deficit, we will create millions of jobs, boost government revenue, shrink our deficit, rebuild our infrastructure and communities, and send wages soaring upwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration, we will finally stand up for American workers and make America great again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. <BR></SPAN></P>
