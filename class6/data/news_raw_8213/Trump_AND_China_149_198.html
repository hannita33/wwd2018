<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shopping might be easier thanks to the Internet, but so is getting duped by counterfeiters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese online shopping giant Alibaba announced Monday it has formed a coalition that will leverage the power of big data to crack down on purveyors of fake goods, whose value in 2015 exceeded $1.7 trillion, according to the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. companies suffer most at the hand of brand pirates, with one-in-five knockoffs infringing on American products, and 63% of counterfeit goods come from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mission of the Alibaba Big Data Anti-Counterfeiting Alliance, whose 20 members include luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Swarovski, is to pool information, data and expertise in intellectual property authentication with the ultimate goal of &quot;helping block, screen and take down infringing listings,&quot; according to a statement from Alibaba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most powerful weapon against counterfeiting today is data and analytics, and the only way we can win this war is to unite,&quot; said Jessie Zheng, Chief Platform Governance Officer of Alibaba Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alibaba, which sells 14.5 billion items a year to Amazon's 5 billion according to courier ParcelHero, has been aggressive about using data analytics to put counterfeiters out of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its software currently scans 10million product listings a day. In the 12 months ending last August, the company closed down 180,000 third-party stores for trafficking in fake items. During that same period, Alibaba provided sufficient information to brands and law enforcement agencies to close 675 counterfeit goods manufacturing operations, the company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the OECD's 2016 report, &quot;Trade in Counterfeit and Pirated Goods: Mapping the Economic Impact,&quot; brands most affected by counterfeiters include Rolex, Ray-Ban, Louis Vuitton and Nike. In fact, footwear tops the categories, followed by clothing, leather goods and electrical equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alibaba's executive chairman, Jack Ma, recently traveled to New York City's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower to meet with President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Ma has pledged to create 1 million U.S. jobs by growing trade between small U.S. businesses and Chinese consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amazon recently announced plans to create 100,000 U.S. jobs over the next 18 months. Most of the positions will be at fulfillment centers, including new facilities under construction in California, Florida, New Jersey and Texas. The new employees will also work in areas such as cloud technology, machine learning, and advanced logistics. <BR></SPAN></P>
