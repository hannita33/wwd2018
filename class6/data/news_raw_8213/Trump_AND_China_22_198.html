<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nominated Iowa's governor to be ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, picked a retired general to be his secretary of Homeland Security, and tapped Oklahoma's attorney general for the Environmental Protection Agency, officials said Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also said Wednesday he will nominate Linda McMahon -- co-founder of the WWE pro wrestling empire -- to be the leader of his Small Business Administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  will return to the campaign trail, aides said, weighing in on the Louisiana U.S. Senate race by appearing at a campaign rally Friday in Baton Rouge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Wednesday he will hold off before filling the secretary of State slot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Next week will be the time I announce it,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told Today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> later confirmed plans to nominate Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as the U.S. ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a nation </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been feuding with in recent days. In a statement, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Branstad &quot;successfully developed close trade ties with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while serving as chief executive of the Hawkeye State.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branstad, who called Chinese President Xi Jinping &quot;an old friend,&quot; said in a statement that he looks forward to &quot;building on our long friendship to cultivate and strengthen the relationship between our two countries and to benefit our economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another major appointment in the offing: retired Marine Corps general John Kelly for the department of Homeland Security, according to a person close to the transition speaking on condition of anonymity pending a formal announcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> job interviews Wednesday included a second round with Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who will be nominated to administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency -- an agency he has sued. As a state official, Pruitt has taken the Obama administration to court over a variety of environmental and other regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Pruitt led Oklahoma's legal challenges to the EPA, Obamacare, executive actions on illegal immigration, Dodd-Frank and President Obama's repeated attempts to bypass Congress,&quot; transition spokesman Jason Miller said. &quot;Attorney General Pruitt has a strong conservative record as a state prosecutor and has demonstrated a familiarity with laws and regulations impacting a large energy resource state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental groups already are lining up against Pruitt, noting that he is supporter of fracking despite its link to a rise of earthquakes in Oklahoma. Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, said that &quot;Scott Pruitt running the EPA is like the fox guarding the henhouse. Time and again, he has fought to pad the profits of Big Polluters at the expense of public health.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miller also said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will attend a  rally Friday in Baton Rouge on behalf of Louisiana Senate candidate John Kennedy. The spokesman said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants &quot;another Republican vote in the United States Senate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect said he continues to consider 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney for secretary of State, and he rejected suggestions that he is stringing out the process in order to mock Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, it's not about revenge,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told NBC. &quot;It's about what's good for the country. And I'm able to put this stuff behind us.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
