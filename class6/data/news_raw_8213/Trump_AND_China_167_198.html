<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With stock indexes in record territory and a 71/2-year bull market chugging along, investors are worried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why should they be, you ask?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. employment market is back to churning out 200,000-plus jobs each month, and the real estate market is filled with willing buyers of new homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But risks remain in a market that is no longer cheap.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It doesn't take a lot to derail the market; if anything goes wrong, swings in the stock market can be pretty pronounced,&quot; says Savita Subramanian, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our call is for a 30% chance of a meaningful correction of up to 20%; it's not our base case, but it's a reasonable case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are five things that could derail the stock market rally:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September is a weak  month for stocks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could vacationers return to work in September after summer holiday and face a market shock?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September is the worst month of performance for the Dow Jones industrial average in the past 50 and 100 years, according to Bespoke Investment Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House race narrows</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The market is assuming Democrat Hillary Clinton will win the November election. But it may be too early to count out Republican Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls vary widely. A sampling of recent surveys, which all show Clinton in the lead, puts the two candidates as few as 4 points apart and as many as 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If polls after Labor Day show Clinton with only a 2- or 3-point lead, &quot;it could inject a mood of uncertainty into markets, which seemingly are convinced </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can't win,&quot; says Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments and respected political and policy market analyst. A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency, he says, would raise fears of a trade war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic policy uncertainty and geopolitical instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's (Clinton) still the favorite, but it's premature to anoint her,&quot; Valliere warns, saying investors will have to wait until after the first debate Sept. 26 before &quot;reaching any definitive conclusions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil rally doesn't stick</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $45 to $50 level seen in the most recent rebound rally in the oil patch might not stick, with lower prices again spooking investors. U.S.-produced crude was down nearly 2% early Wednesday to $47.20 per barrel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sub-$40 per barrel oil impacts everything,&quot; says Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service. &quot;It creates problems for frackers, hurts employment and negatively impacts the ability of energy companies to make profits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some market bulls are counting on the energy sector going from a big drag on the earnings of companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index to a net positive in the second half of this year and next. &quot;Oil below $40 would put that assumption into question,&quot; Warren says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier-than-expected INTEREST RATE hikes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed -- based on recent comments from a handful of members -- keeps saying a rate hike is coming. If Yellen hints strongly of a sooner-than-expected rate increase -- perhaps as early as September -- during her speech Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyo., it could roil markets, as investors aren't expecting any rate hike until at least December. A rate increase likely would boost the value of the dollar, which would hurt earnings of U.S. multinationals and pressure oil prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High hopes could disappoint</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wall Street may be too optimistic in its forecast for corporate earnings growth and overall economic growth, which could set the market up for disappointment, Subramanian says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're leery of the lofty expectations,&quot; she says, adding the market is pricing in 14% profit growth for the S&amp;P 500 in 2017, or double the 7% her firm is forecasting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also says the &quot;hope&quot; bar is raised too high for fiscal spending by governments around the globe to bail out markets. <BR></SPAN></P>
