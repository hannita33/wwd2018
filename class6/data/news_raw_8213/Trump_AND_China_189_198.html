<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the New Hampshire polls are right, Hillary Clinton could be heading into Armageddon -- at least for one night. The state that saved her presidential nomination bid in 2008 looks almost certain to humiliate her Tuesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Clinton is not skipping New Hampshire, where Bernie Sanders is leading her by an average of 18 points. Nor did she skip Iowa, where she finished a devastating third in 2008. Her &quot;reward&quot; this week was holding Sanders to a draw in a state that has never embraced her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victory she claimed was barely discernible (49.9% to Sanders' 49.6%) but it sure beats coming in third behind Barack Obama and John Edwards. If she had lost to Sanders this time, how crushing would that have been? She came to Iowa to banish ghosts, not to suffer another embarrassing loss at the hands of another unlikely opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton accomplished her mission. And if you're one of the many Democrats nervous about her email mess and looking for something to like about her, consider that Iowa could have gone either way. The risk was real, but that did not deter her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compare her grit with the GOP wimps. Some Republicans all but skipped Iowa, and I don't blame them. If you're a practical-minded governor with experience and policy ideas, why even attempt to compete for a huge evangelical contingent (62% of the GOP electorate Monday night) or for the break-the-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">china</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brigade (the 48% who said the best preparation for being president was being from outside politics)? Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> drew 46% of that group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If I were John Kasich, Jeb Bush or Chris Christie, I wouldn't have tried that hard either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Clinton did try hard, even though her mildly hawkish security views, lengthy r&eacute;sum&eacute; and workmanlike view of politics have never evoked the frissons of a Barack or a Bernie among Democrats in the Field of Dreams state. Political viability isn't a huge winner there, either. Only 20% of Democratic caucus voters named &quot;can win in November&quot; as the quality that mattered most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton cleaned up with them and with those who liked an experienced hand. But Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist, completely dominated among the 50% who picked either &quot;cares about people like me&quot; or &quot;honest and trustworthy.&quot; He also swept voters under 45, and those making less than $50,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are dynamics that could well follow Clinton into New Hampshire. But there was never any doubt she'd compete there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton is well positioned to win the Nevada Democratic caucuses on Feb. 20 and the South Carolina Democratic primary on Feb. 27. Decisive victories in those two states would restore her front-runner status and, less favorably for her, the sense of inevitability that drains excitement from the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after battling Sanders to a tie in Iowa and preparing now for what she must know could be a very disappointing evening in New Hampshire, that's a trade she is no doubt happy to make.</SPAN></P>
