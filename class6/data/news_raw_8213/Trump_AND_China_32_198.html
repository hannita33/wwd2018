<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the first presidential debate between Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Hillary Clinton revealed anything, it is that she has passed the presidential test -- and he hasn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not just that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hasn't studied  how to handle a  debate. He hasn't studied how to be president, in particular the commander-in-chief part of the job. That was evident in his rambling responses about &quot;the nuclear&quot; and &quot;the cyber&quot; -- yes, that's really what he calls it -- that have to be read to be believed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton attacked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for inviting Russian President Vladimir Putin &quot;to hack into Americans.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> denied that Russia broke into the Democratic National Committee computers, as most of the intelligence community has concluded. &quot;It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wound up with this gem: &quot;I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's unbelievable all right that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would copy Jimmy Carter's tactic from a 1980 debate when he cited his daughter as an authority on nuclear weapons -- a rhetorical gambit for which he was widely mocked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> response when moderator Lester Holt asked him about America's &quot;longstanding policy on first use&quot; of nuclear weapons -- the U.S. has said it is willing to use nuclear weapons even if an enemy hasn't used them first -- was even more puzzling. &quot;I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it,&quot; he said. &quot;But I would certainly not do first strike.&quot; Thus </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> casually appeared to support President Obama's Utopian desire to rid the world of nuclear weapons while also endorsing a &quot;no first use&quot; policy, a step even Obama seems reluctant to take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But wait, as they say on late night TV (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> natural domain), there's more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of the nuclear arms race, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said: &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should solve that problem for us. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should go into North Korea.&quot; After encouraging a Chinese invasion of North Korea, he suggested that Iran should have solved the  problem as part of the Iran nuclear deal: &quot;Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is  literally the first person ever to suggest that Iran could stop the North Korean nuclear program. That he is saying something so outlandish before one of the biggest TV audiences in history suggests that he is not only ignorant but also -- and even more worrying -- uneducable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said  in March, when asked about his foreign policy advisers: &quot;I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> definitely has said a lot of things -- and the more he talks the more obvious he makes it that he is totally unfit to be commander in chief.</SPAN></P>
