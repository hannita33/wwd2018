</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversial front-runner Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he's attracting people who are &quot;voting out of love,&quot; even as he finds himself defending new accusations of violence among his supporters and facing criticism for praising authoritarian leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're taking people from the Democrat Party. We're taking people as independents, and they're all coming out and the whole world is talking about it. It's very exciting,&quot; he said at the start of a debate in Miami that was largely a civil affair but for a couple of minor exceptions. &quot;The Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what's happening. ... Be smart and unify.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was looking to Thursday's debate to anchor his lead in the GOP presidential race, while opponents Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich hoped to improve their position or simply survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do-or-die pressure is building for the four remaining candidates. This was the 12th debate -- and it was originally slated to be the last. But as full-blown resistance to a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nomination has broken out in some quarters of the party, GOP officials added another one, in Utah on March 21, when half of the delegates to national convention will have been awarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been the target of intense attacks during the last two debates, including by Rubio, who mocked the New York businessman for the size of his hands and, with innuendo, about other parts of his anatomy. But Rubio expressed regret this week for the nature of some of his remarks. Republican analysts believe the trash-talking insults hurt Rubio, a Florida U.S. senator, as much as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and contributed to Rubio's failure to win any state in the &quot;Super Tuesday 2&quot; primaries earlier this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN moderator Jake Tapper called for a &quot;serious&quot; debate, and the candidates did lower the volume. Without the shouting, spectators could hear their thoughts on immigration, trade, jobs, education, Israel, counterterrorism, and Social Security, a big issue in Florida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far I cannot believe how civil it's been up here,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said half an hour into the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pledged to turn around the problem of decreasing worker wages, saying, &quot;I think that's why there has been such an outpouring of love to what I'm saying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he was confronted during the debate for inciting violence at his rallies, by saying he wanted to punch a protester in the face and for telling the crowd to &quot;knock the crap out of&quot; another protester. On Wednesday, police in Fayetteville, N.C., arrested a 78-year-old man for punching a protester in the face as he was being escorted out of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I certainly do not condone that at all,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. But then he added: &quot;We have some protesters who are bad dudes. ... They are really dangerous. They get in there and they start hitting people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cruz, when asked if such scenes hurt the GOP for general election, said: &quot;For every one of us, we need to show respect for the people. We need to remember who it is we're working for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rubio was smoother and more subdued in the past, but called out the fire-tongued </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for his controversial rhetoric. &quot;The problem is presidents can't just say anything they want. It has consequences here and around the world,&quot; Rubio said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has been accused of praising authoritarianism, said he thinks Russia's Vladimir Putin is &quot;a strong leader,&quot; and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has a strong government, but that doesn't mean he endorses what they do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the candidates supported the idea of sending in American troops to fight the Islamic State if military leaders recommended it, with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> citing numbers of up to 20,000 to 30,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before the event began, Republican Party chairman Reince Priebus addressed the crowd, saying he wanted to clear up something: The party will support the eventual nominee -- &quot;whoever that is&quot; -- 100%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words: The establishment would fully back </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> if he wins the nomination. <BR></SPAN></P>
