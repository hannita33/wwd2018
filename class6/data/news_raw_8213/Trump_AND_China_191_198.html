<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversial Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who campaigned on a vow to kill 100,000 criminals, is making good on his promise less than two weeks into his term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that short span, he has left a bloody trail of drug world executions that is drawing alarm from human rights groups and opposition politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duterte was sworn in June 30, and within the first week of his presidency, 72 people accused of being drug dealers were killed by police and vigilante groups, according to a &quot;Kill List&quot; compiled by the newspaper Philippine Inquirer. Dating back to Duterte's election victory May 10, the figure jumps to 119.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend, police reported nine more killings, including an unidentified man found in Manila with his head wrapped in tape and a cardboard sign on his torso that read, &quot;I Am a Pusher.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights lawyer Jose Manuel Diokno, national chairman of the Free Legal Assistance Group, called the spate of killings &quot;a nuclear explosion of violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do we really want to give the man with the gun the power to judge who are criminals and to kill them? To decide who is bad and who is good, who deserves to live and who deserves to die?&quot; he wrote in a blog for the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killings also have drawn condemnation from international rights groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Human Rights Watch is concerned that President Duterte's electoral platform, which included repeated promises to kill those deemed to be criminals and drug dealers, may be interpreted by some as a legitimization of the unlawful concept of extrajudicial killings as an acceptable approach to crime control,&quot; said Phelim Kine, the group's Asia deputy director. &quot;Not only does each case need to be investigated, but it's crucial there be an inquiry into the surge in killings since June 30 and action taken to put an end to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duterte, whose incendiary rhetoric has earned him comparisons to Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaigned on a platform of law and order and ending corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven-term mayor of Davao, a city on the restive southern island of Mindanao, was wildly popular for solving the city's drug and crime problems. But his tactics, which earned him nicknames such as &quot;The Punisher&quot; and &quot;Duterte Harry,&quot; included more than 1,000 extrajudicial killings using death squads, according to rights groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After winning the presidency in a landslide victory in May, Duterte doubled down on his tough talk. Last month, he encouraged vigilante justice against criminals and drug dealers in a televised address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Please feel free to call us, the police, or do it yourself if you have the gun, you have my support,&quot; he said. &quot;You can kill him. Shoot him, and I'll give you a medal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days after taking office, Duterte publicly named five high-ranking police officials allegedly tied to the drug trade and ordered them removed from their posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He named three major drug traffickers, all Chinese nationals, in a televised speech and warned that they would be executed if they remained involved in the drug trade. Two are in prison but could be operating their drug empires from behind bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third was out of the country, and Duterte warned him not to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The moment he steps off the plane, he will die,&quot; Duterte said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An opposition political leader, Sen. Leila de Lima, called last week for a legislative investigation into the spate of killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duterte also has his supporters in government for his brutal approach to fighting drugs and crime in a country that has been deeply plagued by both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large segment of the population appears willing to give Duterte's violent tactics a chance, according to political analyst Richard Javad Heydarian, author of Asia's New Battlefield: The USA, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Struggle for the Western Pacific.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Though liberal circles and human rights groups have expressed strong criticism in recent days, it seems much of the public is adopting a passive or wait-and-see approach, since there is a deep sense that previous administrations dedicated limited political capital to ensuring law and order,&quot; Heydarian said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High-ranking officials in the Duterte administration remain unbowed by the criticism of how they wage the drug war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solicitor General Jose Calida, the top legal official in the country, assured police Monday that he would protect them against any charges of extrajudicial killings. <BR></SPAN></P>
