<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their first verbal standoff, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un indicated his country is in the final stages of testing a missile with a nuclear weapon that can reach the United States, and President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has vowed that it &quot;won't happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> options for making good on that tweet sent Monday include everything  from diplomacy to a pre-emptive military strike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are some options for dealing with the North Korean nuclear threat, according to former U.S. negotiators, arms control experts and analysts who have studied the region:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WORK THROUGH </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CHINA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could start by trying to work with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rather than antagonize it, says Chris Hill, who led U.S. negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program  for President George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there is a solution, that solution will be with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; North Korea's most important ally, says Hill, now dean of the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver. &quot;The president-elect should be careful about picking fights with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over trade or the one-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy because he will need a lot of his capital for North Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since his election, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accepted a congratulatory phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. That was a breach of U.S. policy, which does not recognize Taiwan's sovereignty. (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> considers Taiwan a breakaway province that someday will be reunited with the mainland.) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> later questioned whether the United States &quot;should be bound&quot; by the &quot;one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; policy, unless </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cooperates on &quot;other things, including trade.&quot; The &quot;one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy&quot; recognizes the communist leaders in Beijing as the only legitimate Chinese government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would put cooperation with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on North Korea above any efforts to change the status quo of the Taiwan relationship or the (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-U.S.) trade relationship,&quot; Hill says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TOUGHEN REGIONAL DEFENSES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could increase deterrence activities along with allies South Korea and Japan, says Richard Bush, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That means moving ahead and expanding plans to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile shield that President Obama promised South Korea, where nearly 30,000 U.S. troops are stationed. It also means expanding live-fire joint exercises with South Korea and Japan, which would require North Korea to devote resources to monitor and respond to military activities on its borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. also could fly more B-52 strategic bombers over North Korea and engage in more operations &quot;to influence what's going on in the public mind of North Koreans,&quot; Bush says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OFFER ECONOMIC INCENTIVES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should offer North Korea economic aid if it agrees to stop testing nuclear weapons, says James Acton, co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The North participated in such negotiations with Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama, and  it agreed to deals it then cheated on and abandoned. Acton concedes that approach now is &quot;unlikely to succeed,&quot; given North Korea's pattern, but he says it is worth trying again. &quot;It's the least bad of a really bad bunch of options,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IMPOSE NEW SANCTIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increased sanctions on North Korea is another option, but it, too, has been tried and has failed to achieve the desired result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Economic sanctions, increasing air deterrence efforts on the Korean peninsula and ... encouraging </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to use economic means to pressure North Korea -- that package of actions and programs (is) connected to the realities we face,&quot; the Brookings Institution's Bush says. &quot;It also sounds a lot like the Obama administration's policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite sanctions, North Korea continues to conduct nuclear tests -- including two in 2016 -- and missile tests in violation of United Nations resolutions opposing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PRE-EMPTIVE NUCLEAR STRIKE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to &quot;quickly decapitate the head of the snake&quot; and do it without mobilizing 100,000 U.S. troops to invade North Korea, he could order a military strike on the capital, Pyongyang, says Robert Kelley, a former director at the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelley, a fellow at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, says he is not advocating a nuclear strike, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might consider the option. &quot;In the short term it would remove the threat,&quot; Kelley says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acton says a pre-emptive nuclear or conventional strike would be unlikely and a huge risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Presumably the nuclear weapons are located elsewhere, and commanders may have launch authority to use them in the event the leadership is destroyed,&quot; Acton says. &quot;Going after Kim Jong Un and a large part of his leadership structure doesn't necessarily remove the threat.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
