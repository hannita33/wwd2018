<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International trade has taken a beating in this year's presidential campaign. Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Bernie Sanders regularly bash it in their stump speeches, and even Hillary Clinton turned against an Asian trade agreement that she championed while secretary of State.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the evidence that trade stimulates innovation, lowers prices and offers consumers more choice, this has been a big disappointment. It has infected both parties and comes off as a highly cynical ploy to win over voters by playing with their emotions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, supporters of responsible trade need to understand why the electorate has turned so sour and find ways to help those left behind by globalization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The data show the problem: Manufacturing employment has fallen by nearly 5 million, or about 28%, in the past two decades. Meanwhile, the recovery from the Great Recession remains modest, evidenced by the creation of just 38,000 jobs in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But halting pending trade deals, or even repealing existing ones, is not the answer. The U.S. does not have any commerce agreements with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or Japan. And yet those nations consistently maintain the largest trade surpluses with America. In fact, only three of our 15 largest trade partners -- Canada, Mexico and South Korea -- have trade agreements with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, there is strong evidence that technology is the main reason for the decline in manufacturing employment. Manufacturing output has continued to rise thanks to more automated workplaces and a focus on higher-tech products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only real solution to the decline is to train young people in areas with a more promising outlook, and to retrain workers who've lost jobs or fear they might.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news is that, after years of trial and error, government leaders are beginning to get a sense of what works and what doesn't. To that end, President Obama signed a bipartisan law two years ago to eliminate notoriously overlapping or unproductive training programs and give states more freedom to spend jobs money as they see fit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virtually everyone agrees that what works are apprenticeships and similar programs that bring employers into the process early and have workers do much of their learning on the job. Some successful programs, like one in Wisconsin known as WTRP/Big Step, focus on glaziers, electricians, cement masons and other traditional blue-collar trades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are branching into health care and other areas not generally thought of as landing spots for people without a college education. Two large European insurance companies -- Aon and the Zurich Insurance Group -- have apprenticeships for people as claims adjusters and other positions in their industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We ought to double down on approaches like these, instead of erecting trade barriers that would do terrible harm to the economy or making futile efforts to limit technological advance. Candidates for high office should be candid about this. And they should get behind programs that might actually do some good. <BR></SPAN></P>
