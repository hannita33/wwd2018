<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inauguration, his wife, Melania, will return home to their gilded penthouse in New York -- leaving much of the work traditionally associated with the unpaid and often thankless role of first lady to her stepdaughter Ivanka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, the full-time non-job of chief hostess and domestic diplomat has been evolving ever since Martha Washington held it. She complained in a letter to her niece that &quot;I think I am more like a state prisoner than anything else, there is certain bounds set for me which I must not depart from.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked during a joint appearance with Laura Bush in Tanzania whether she ever felt that way, Michelle Obama answered that though the &quot;best job in the world&quot; does have &quot;prison elements,'' she had nothing to complain about. Do I have to remind you of the outraged headlines that followed? Breitbart's was &quot;White House 'prison': The Obamas love the perks, hate the office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not hard to understand why Mrs. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might want to minimize our opportunities to analyze her hairstyle and travel at taxpayer expense, and whether any down-market shopping trips are for real or for show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daughters, nieces, in-laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not unprecedented for a first daughter to act as first lady, either: The daughters of Thomas Jefferson and John Tyler, Andrew Jackson's niece and Martin Van Buren's daughter-in-law all did so for widowed presidents. Zachary Taylor's daughter filled in for her ailing mother, and James Buchanan's niece did the honors for her bachelor uncle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public role of first lady has expanded considerably, though. And one of its chief functions has always been to divert and absorb some of the criticism that might otherwise accrue to the president. Much of the disparagement has been monumentally unfair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London-born Louisa Adams, John Quincy Adams' wife, was derided for having an English mother. Andrew Jackson's wife, Rachel, whom he felt had been hounded to her death just before his inauguration, was briefly a bigamist, yes, but she hadn't known her ex hadn't gone through with their divorce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Todd Lincoln may have been a one-woman economic stimulus program, but she did not deserve to be accused of treason, or committed to an asylum by her only surviving child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleanor Roosevelt was hated for her activism, and Mamie Eisenhower was considered too inactive. Admired as Jackie Kennedy was, the same clothes that made her a fashion icon also got her painted as a spendthrift. Nancy Reagan was dubbed &quot;Queen Nancy&quot; for loving couture, buying White House </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">china,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other perceived sins that were only forgiven after she sang about them self-deprecatingly at a press dinner. When Hillary Clinton was first lady, both she and her husband were effectively accused of being serial killers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retiring the role</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surprise is not that Melania </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seems to be able to resist the allure of life in the White House, but that the de facto retirement of the role as we've known it has occasioned little conversation beyond the initial sniping about her decision to let her son finish the year in his school in Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doubtless that's at least in part because her husband's critics are already fully employed. Amid worries about his potential conflicts of interest and admiration for Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, it's hard to get too excited about her whereabouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the reason, I'm glad Melania </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been able to signal she'll stay off the public stage more than on it without exciting too much pushback. (And if putting your son's welfare first isn't a good reason, then what was the feminist movement about?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, I'm glad that she's retiring the role itself, for now anyway. Michelle Obama certainly served admirably, focusing on what you'd think would have been the wildly uncontroversial issues of military families and proper nutrition. But the same cannot be said of her detractors, whose repeated racist potshots only made her &quot;when they go low, we go high&quot; response all the more impressive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is certainly not the reimagining of the job expected by those who were hoping to see Bill Clinton serving as &quot;first gentleman.&quot; But when, not if, a woman is elected president, her spouse will be able to thank all his predecessors for showing the many different ways his job can be done. And Mrs. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for showing that it doesn't have to be done at all.</SPAN></P>
