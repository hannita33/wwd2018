<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Bernie Sanders have made white working-class resentments over international trade central to their presidential bids. But neither takes the issue seriously. Ironically, the one who does is the candidate most identified with free trade: Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Sanders often blame </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for taking American jobs. In this regard, they are right. Between 2001 and 2007, job growth in U.S. manufacturing was 30% lower than it would have been had Congress not passed &quot;permanent normal trade relations&quot; between the two countries in 2000. According to a 2013 study by economists Peter Schott and Justin Pierce, the Great Recession is partly to blame for lost jobs and lost job growth, but so is this &quot;major change in U.S. trade policy.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Sanders are also wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world we live in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lost job growth isn't due to bad deals with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> because the United States does not have bilateral trade agreements with that country. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and America are, however, members of the World Trade Organization, which writes the rules of commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A condition of membership was lifting trade barriers. To influence commerce rules, and to benefit from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> liberalized economy, the U.S. dropped tariffs on Chinese imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Sanders may blame trade deals for the plight of the white working class, but the real issue is a global economy. That is the world we live in and the reason President Obama is seeking congressional approval of the gigantic Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). It's to the advantage of the United States, he says, to help write the rules of the global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Obama has proposed many ways of helping people who feel the brunt of the global economy, including free community college and tax credits for manufacturing communities. Nor has he stood idle while </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> breaks WTO rules:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2009, the administration slapped a 35% duty on cheap Chinese truck tires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, the Commerce Department announced a new 266% tariff on Chinese steel being dumped onto the U.S. market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A complaint made a year ago with the WTO has forced </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to stop subsidizing companies exporting seafood, textiles and other goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former secretary of State Clinton was for the TPP before she was against it, and she might yet be for it once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrast that with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has called the 12-nation TPP pact &quot;insanity,&quot; and Sanders, who says it's &quot;disastrous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Chief trade prosecutor'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Clinton's wobbly on the TPP, she's Obama's equal in proposals to help struggling workers, and she vows to be even tougher than the president on trade violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has proposed appointing a &quot;chief trade prosecutor&quot; who reports directly to the president, and called for tripling &quot;the number of trade enforcement officers and build new early-warning systems so we can intervene before trade violations cost American jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She appears ready, moreover, to use tariffs to deter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> currency manipulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet trade crackdowns and help for displaced workers are only part of a solution. Another important element is holding accountable corporations that benefit from a global economy. And it is here that Clinton emerges as the most serious candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's claim on this is a tax proposal that gives corporations incentives to invest in the USA. According to her &quot;clawback&quot; plan, firms relocating overseas must repay any taxpayer assistance they ever received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Clinton told the New York Daily News, tax relief is given in exchange for creating jobs. There was, she said, &quot;an implicit bargain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elizabeth Warren, the progressive icon, invoked the same implicit bargain while running for the Senate in 2012. Corporations are part of communities with multiple stakeholders, she said: &quot;Part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's proposal to make firms stay or pay is good policy that is also good politics. Given how closely her views resemble Sen. Warren's, it's ironic that the presidential candidate most identified with free trade could be the most progressive.</SPAN></P>
