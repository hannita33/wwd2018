Twitter offers little scope for elaboration, especially by a political figure who has not yet assumed office. Still, it is difficult to find any basis for the over-the-top emotional response by critics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's look at what the president-elect accomplished by his remarks, and assess the evidence that may have contributed to its timing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Dec. 21, the president-elect met with the nation's senior military leadership, including officers with responsibility for managing our nuclear deterrent; he got an earful. On Dec. 22, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with his senior military leadership for their annual review of Russia's defense capabilities and future needs. Putin said, &quot;It is necessary to strengthen the combat potential of the strategic nuclear forces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Dec. 22, the president-elect responded to Putin: the U.S. &quot;must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes&quot;; and reinforced his commitment to sustaining the credibility of the U.S. nuclear &quot;umbrella&quot; in saying the next day, &quot;Let it be an arms race. ... We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect's remarks are consistent with 70 years of U.S. policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most important diplomatic achievement of the nuclear era is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The treaty stopped the proliferation of nuclear weapons by allies because they were convinced that the U.S. would provide a nuclear &quot;umbrella.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has multiplied its number of warheads five times in the past decade, and Russia is poised for a vast &quot;breakout' from two to five times or more of its number of warheads after New START ends in 2021.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reassured Asian and European allies of the reliability of the U.S. nuclear &quot;umbrella&quot; as have his predecessors. The U.S. would not allow the vast Chinese and Russian nuclear modernization to undermine their commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</SPAN></P>
