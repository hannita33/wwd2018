<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While announcing key members of his economic team, President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Wednesday he will separate himself from his global business interests while serving as president, though he will wait a couple of weeks before providing details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said during an early morning tweet storm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has suggested that his children would run his business empire in his absence, though ethics lawyers said he must take additional steps in order to comply with conflict-of-interest laws.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He must also exit the ownership of his businesses through using a blind trust or equivalent,&quot; said a joint statement from Norman Eisen and Richard W. Painter, who served as chief White House ethics lawyers for Presidents Obama and George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Otherwise,&quot; they said, &quot;he will have a personal financial interest in his businesses that will sometimes conflict with the public interest, and constantly raise questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his tweet storm, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he is not &quot;mandated&quot; to dis-invest. &quot;I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses.&quot; They include hotels, resorts and office towers across the world, from the celebrated Turnberry golf course in Scotland to a newly opened hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York real estate mogul did not provide details about how his new business arrangement might work, and whether his children might operate his holdings moving forward. He tweeted that &quot;legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made the announcement the same day he named key members of his economic team, tapping hedge-fund manager and campaign aide Steven Mnuchin as secretary of the Treasury and billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as secretary of Commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a CNBC interview, Mnuchin said his priority is cutting taxes, particularly corporate taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By cutting corporate taxes, we're going to create huge economic growth, and we'll have huge personal income,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mnuchin, 53, a former Goldman Sachs executive, worked this year as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> national campaign finance chairman. In announcing his selection, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> described Mnuchin as &quot;a world-class financier, banker and businessman&quot; who &quot;has played a key role in developing our plan to build a dynamic, booming economy that will create millions of jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If confirmed, the Treasury secretary nominee would shepherd economic plans that include a reduction in government regulations and stepped-up infrastructure projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ross, the nominee for Commerce secretary, co-authored an infrastructure plan that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aides are studying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing the appointment of Ross, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the investor known for buying and reorganizing businesses is &quot;a champion of American manufacturing and knows how to help companies succeed. Most importantly, he is one of the greatest negotiators I have ever met, and that comes from me, the author of The Art of the Deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also said that Ross &quot;knows that cutting taxes for working families, reducing burdensome government regulations and unleashing America's energy resources will strengthen our economy at a time when our country needs to see significant growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also discussing his appointment on CNBC, Ross said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration will pursue bilateral trade agreements with individual countries, as opposed to regional pacts like the now-stalled Trans-Pacific Partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also announced the selection of a former critic to be deputy Commerce secretary: Todd Ricketts, a co-owner of the Chicago Cubs and member of a Republican political family that financed attack ads on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during the Republican primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economy will also be front and center as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans his first public appearance since the election more than three weeks ago: a trip to Indiana to celebrate Carrier's decision to keep 1,000 manufacturing jobs at its air-conditioning plant in the state rather than move them to Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carrier's decision came after negotiations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana, that included new tax breaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also plans to kick off a &quot;thank you&quot; tour of states that provided his margin of victory in the Electoral College, a series of rallies set to begin Thursday in Cincinnati.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic appointments were overshadowed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> announcement about his business empire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent weeks, congressional Democrats and government analysts have questioned how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could conduct the presidency without violating conflict-of-interest guidelines involving his various global businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressional Democrats have made clear they will focus on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., plans to ask the Senate to pass a resolution that would require </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to hand over control of his businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The American public has a right to know that the president of the United States is acting in their best interest, and not because he or she has received some benefit ... from a foreign government like Russia or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or any other foreign entity,&quot; Cardin said. <BR></SPAN></P>
