<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton in West Virginia's Democratic primary Tuesday, while Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with no remaining challengers, claimed an easy victory there and in Nebraska among Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Clinton's loss will probably matter little to her presidential nominating battle with Sanders, it is a powerful reminder of her challenges in a general election match-up with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the presumptive Republican nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West Virginia has a large number of working-class white voters, the demographic </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hopes will carry him to victory in Rust Belt states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio in November.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's performance in West Virginia -- a state she won by a wide margin in the 2008 primaries -- could point to problems with a  voting bloc that supported her husband during the more economically prosperous 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These same voters feel left behind as manufacturing jobs have disappeared and the coal industry has declined amid a shift to cleaner sources of energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vows to bring coal and manufacturing jobs back to depressed pockets of Appalachia by slapping tariffs on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and reworking trade deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alternatively, Clinton's vision is to move these communities to a new generation of jobs, acknowledging a coal industry renaissance is not in the cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech at southeastern Ohio brewery last week, Clinton said coal is still a part of the nation's energy supply, but even big coal-consuming nations such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are starting to burn less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No matter what some politicians tell you, these trends are here to stay,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not a message West Virginians seem to want to hear. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leads Clinton by 27 percentage points in West Virginia, according to a recent Public Policy Polling survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with his performance in West Virginia with white, working-class voters, he's picking up steam in more critical Midwestern swing states that Clinton has to carry in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats have assumed Clinton would beat </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan, which voted twice for Barack Obama and are populated by the blue-collar, union households that have been the Democratic Party's lifeblood for generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet a new Quinnipiac University Swing State Poll shows Clinton and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a dead heat in two of them: Ohio and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton is trying to cast </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a fraud whose rhetoric about helping lower-income Americans does not match his policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday in Louisville, she said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;actually stood on a debate stage and argued that Americans are paid too much, not too little,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In West Virginia, Clinton suffered from her association with Obama, whose policies have accelerated the nation's shift to greener sources of energy without providing a safety net for workers dependent on the coal industry, according to Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat who represents the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been very harmful to the Democratic Party in West Virginia,&quot; Manchin said during a recent Clinton campaign stop in Charleston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the Republican side, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the first time faced a cleared field in GOP primaries in West Virginia and Nebraska (Democrats held a caucus there in March).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His two remaining rivals, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, dropped out of the Republican race last week after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> win in the Indiana primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was 169 delegates short of the 1,237 needed to officially clinch the nomination before Tuesday's primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Democratic race, Clinton led Sanders, a Vermont senator, by nearly 300 pledged delegates entering Tuesday's contest. West Virginia had 29 delegates at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the Democratic Party's proportional allocation system, Sanders stood to only modestly boost his delegate total with his win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanders, who also won last week's Indiana primary, pledged to &quot;take the political revolution&quot; to the convention during a rally in Sacramento on Monday. <BR></SPAN></P>
