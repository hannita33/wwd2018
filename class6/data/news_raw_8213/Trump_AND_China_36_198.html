<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese President Xi Jinping recently toured the headquarters of three state-run media organizations, telling journalists to be loyal to the Communist Party in &quot;thought, politics and action.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if to underscore how seriously journalists took his admonition, coverage turned comically positive. Chinese national television CCTV reported that Xi liked a news app he was shown: &quot;Quite literally, he hit 'like,'&quot; an enthusiastic anchor said. CCTV also noted that a staffer for the Xinhua news agency said Xi's &quot;encouragement was their driving force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visit might have been a big hit with the regime, but it came as a big disappointment to anyone who thought that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decades-long economic expansion and growing middle class would lead to greater freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese government is in the midst of a news media crackdown. In addition to issuing loyalty edicts, it has arrested journalists for covering Beijing protests and last summer's stock market crash. Lest people try to bypass official news media, the government continues to strengthen the Great Firewall of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that prevents free access to information on the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> domestic moves make its recent aggressive military posture all the more foreboding. Rather than leveraging its growing prestige to become a trusted international leader, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has spent the past few years building its military and making dubious claims to islands in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has created artificial islands  with weapons, inviting conflict with neighbors and America, despite assurances </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would not. Xi and Obama plan to meet Thursday at a nuclear security meeting in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responsible nations don't act like this. Whatever natural resources or military advantages could be gained through these islands are less valuable than the good faith </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is squandering with its neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese government has not been without redeeming qualities. It agreed to steep cuts in carbon emissions and recently OK'd sanctions on North Korea that it had long resisted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-bashing of the kind espoused by presidential candidates Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Bernie Sanders is not constructive. Notwithstanding its recent behavior, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not a new Cold War adversary. Even so, the U.S. and its allies need to step up pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best place to start would be to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade pact that excludes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The TPP gets a bum rap from both parties, while former trade stalwart and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has abandoned it. But the TPP is vital to reassure Pacific allies and counter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. needs to forge stronger Asian military ties and make clear that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aggression abroad and repression at home are not in its best interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not behaving the way Western nations envisioned when they welcomed it into a series of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements. It's too soon to give up. But Obama and U.S. allies need to forcefully push back against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> troubling direction under Xi. If not, the silliness of Chinese reporting will be the least of America's problems. <BR></SPAN></P>
