<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With one eye on his historical legacy and another on this year's election, President Obama on Wednesday trumpeted his economic record, ripped Republican political ideas and urged voters to elect a Democratic successor who will follow through on his policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If what you really care about in this election is your pocketbook -- if what you're concerned about is who will look out for the interests of working people and grow the middle class ... then the debate is not even close,&quot; Obama said during a campaign-style speech in Elkhart, Ind.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In returning to Elkhart -- a city he visited during his first year in office in 2009 in the midst of a recession-triggering financial crisis -- Obama stressed the decline of the unemployment rate and steady increases in job growth during his two terms in office. He touted the administration's initiatives ranging from the landmark health care law to new Wall Street regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama delivered his speech as Republican critics, including presumptive presidential nominee Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said the recovery is uneven at best, citing stagnant wages and trade deals they said have undercut manufacturing jobs in the USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are losing our jobs to everybody,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told supporters in California last week. &quot;We are going to bring back jobs like we haven't seen in this country for many, many decades.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Obama has a &quot;legacy of economic malaise,&quot; and &quot;Americans deserve more than a victory lap celebrating stagnant wages, lukewarm economic growth (and) persistently high poverty rates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders praise Obama's administration, but they have raised economic concerns, including increased college costs and income inequality. Both Democrats oppose the Obama-backed Asian trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though he didn't mention </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (or any other candidate) by name, Obama said the Republicans picked their presidential nominee because of &quot;economic anxiety&quot; fueling &quot;an unusual election year.&quot; He repeatedly denounced </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposals, saying that the idea of deporting 11 million people in the country illegally is a &quot;fantasy&quot; and that &quot;we cannot put up walls around America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama said &quot;provocative&quot; tweets are not good reasons to support any candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arguing that the political parties have &quot;two very different visions,&quot; Obama said the Republicans' approach to the economy would &quot;lower wages, eliminate worker protections, cut investments in things like education, weaken the safety net, kick people off health insurance and let </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> write the rules for the global economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president said that for decades, Republicans have spread &quot;myths&quot; about the impact that immigration, welfare programs, trade policy and &quot;big government&quot; have had on the economy and middle-class families. He denounced what he called the GOP's &quot;cult of small government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic agenda, Obama said, &quot;won't solve every problem&quot; or &quot;make everybody financially secure overnight,&quot; but it will &quot;point us in the right direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2009, the president visited the Elkhart area before and after passage of the $840 billion stimulus bill, a package of infrastructure and education projects Obama and aides call the Recovery Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stimulus and other Obama administration actions, including the automobile industry bailout, helped stave off another Great Depression, the president said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elkhart, a city known for production of recreational vehicles, saw its unemployment rate soar to 19.6% during the financial crisis; Obama noted that it is now down to about 4%. Nationally, the jobless rate has fallen from 10% to 5% this past April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Casting Elkhart as a symbol of America's recovery, Obama cited reductions in home foreclosures and increases in high school graduation rates. He said the U.S. economy  is improving despite Republican efforts to obstruct most of his plans. &quot;America's economy is not just better than it was eight years ago, it is the strongest, most durable economy in the world,&quot; Obama said. <BR></SPAN></P>
