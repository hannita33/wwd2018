<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama began his presidency with a series of foreign trips that critics derided as an &quot;apology tour.&quot; Now, just a week after voters repudiated that presidency by turning the White House over to a bitter rival, Obama departs for what might be described as a humility tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His visits to Greece, Germany and Peru this week will deal with a wide range of American issues abroad -- all of them cast in a new light by one big development back home: the election of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course, the Europeans are all mouths agape. 'How did this happen? What does it mean?'&quot; said Kurt Volker, the former U.S. permanent representative to NATO in the Bush and Obama administrations who spent election night in Berlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Obama was the president-elect, he often reminded people that the United States only has &quot;one president at a time.&quot; And while White House aides say he'll be &quot;running through the tape&quot; until Jan. 20, they also acknowledged that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election looms over the agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, we certainly expect that the election will be the primary topic on people's minds everywhere we go,&quot; said deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most important, he said, is the NATO alliance itself.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he would reconsider the alliance if other member countries don't pay their share of common defense expenditures, 2% of gross domestic product. Only five countries -- the United States, Greece, the United Kingdom, Estonia and Poland -- meet that benchmark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama  also will acknowledge that many western democracies are seeing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-like movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On both sides of the Atlantic, we face the task of ensuring that our political institutions and economic policies are responsive to our people, many of whom feel that they have been hurt by globalization and trade,&quot; Obama said in an interview published Sunday in the Athens newspaper I Kathimerini. &quot;My message -- especially with my visit coming so soon after a hard-fought election campaign in the United States -- will be that as our nations confront these challenges together, Americans continue to place enormous importance on our alliance with Greece.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's week-long foreign trip -- the last one scheduled before he leaves office -- will stop in three cities:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athens.  Obama will express support for Greece's economic reforms in the wake of the euro debt crisis as he meets with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras  on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the highlight of the visit is a speech on globalization -- a speech that was planned before the election result, but will take on new resonance after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory. &quot;That will include, frankly, acknowledgment  of our election results, the Brexit election results,&quot; said Rhodes, Obama's chief foreign policy speechwriter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berlin. Obama's trip to Hanover  in April was supposed to be his last visit to Germany. So the addition of one  final trip -- his sixth overall, more than any country except France -- underscores the  importance of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Obama will meet with Merkel Thursday and hold a joint press conference followed by a private dinner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain  also will travel to Berlin for meetings Friday on the Islamic State, Europe's migration issues, Syria and Ukraine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lima, Peru. The European legs were relatively late additions to the  schedule, and were planned around the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama will meet with the 21 APEC countries on Sunday,  and a smaller group of 12 nations who signed on to the Trans-Pacific Partnership Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House aides said they understand  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election has changed the equation on U.S. ratification of the deal. &quot;But we continue to think that these types of deals make sense, simply because countries like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are not going to stop working on regional agreements,&quot; said deputy national security adviser Wally Adeyemo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama  also will hold a town hall for young leaders, and meet separately with Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Australian  Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. <BR></SPAN></P>
