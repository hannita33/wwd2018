</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">710 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a recent flight to Chicago, I sat next to a very nice woman with a British-sounding accent who was from Zimbabwe but had gone to school in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As tends to happen these days, our conversation veered into the U.S. presidential elections. &quot;My friends in London mainly want to know if Americans have lost all their senses,&quot; she told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She told me this as I thumbed through that week's edition of The Economist, whose cover heralded: &quot;The debasing of American politics.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hacked emails. Sexual assault claims. FBI investigations. Vows to jail political opponents. Corruption allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This election season has certainly served up a smorgasbord of reality-TV-like fodder that has stunned and dismayed many of our allies abroad. But we can learn from other nations, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A good place to start is Britain, which is starting to feel hangover pangs from the Brexit referendum, in which 52% of voters chose for the U.K. to withdraw from the European Union. The pound is down 15% on a trade-weighted basis since the Brexit vote, according to the Economist, closing in on the depths it reached during the 2008-09 crisis and near the bottom of the 154 currencies tracked by Bloomberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A root cause of the sterling's plunge, according to the British newspaper, is &quot;fear that Britain is turning into a xenophobic, interventionist and unpredictable place, with calls to clamp down on foreign workers and foreign capital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sound familiar?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy agenda up until now has been tinged with similar xenophobic and unpredictable tones, from calling for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. to promises that he'll renegotiate NAFTA, withdraw from the World Trade Organization and slap tariffs on Mexican and Chinese goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His vows to tinker with and, in some cases, tear up trade deals have some economists most worried. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he will renegotiate many of the deals for better terms. But a recent study by the pro-trade Peterson Institute for International Economics warned that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade proposals, if enacted, could cost the U.S. more than 4 million jobs and spin the country into a recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As president, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would have wide leeway to alter trade deals. In a worst-case scenario, if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mexico retaliate by raising tariffs on American goods, America could be facing a &quot;full trade war,&quot; and unemployment could rocket to more than 8%, according to the Peterson study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study's authors examined both candidates' trade policies but concluded </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be far worse. &quot;While Clinton's stated trade policy would be harmful, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stated trade policy would be horribly destructive,&quot; one of its authors wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So can any parallels be drawn between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade positions and the Brexit fallout?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plenty, according to Jennifer Hillman, a Georgetown University law professor who focuses on trade and has studied the Brexit effect. The rhetoric from supporters of Brexit -- fear of foreign workers taking local jobs -- has been nearly identical to those found in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally speeches, she told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech in North Carolina last week, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reiterated his threat to slap tariffs on goods made overseas by companies that have shipped jobs overseas. &quot;At the center of my jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals,&quot; he told the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But higher tariffs will not bring jobs back to the USA. More than 85% of them have been lost to automation and technology, not trade agreements, according to most studies, Hillman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It doesn't matter what you do with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; she said. &quot;Are you going to get rid of every robot at the end of every assembly line? Probably not. Stopping trade isn't going to bring those jobs back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain, through its Brexit pains, and other European countries who embrace a nationalist, protectionist philosophy are fast discovering a pesky consequence of that thinking: It's bad for business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a huge loss for the U.K., and a huge loss for the world,&quot; Hillman said of Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, trade wars and Britain's currency woes are far less sexy than sexual delinquency and hacked emails and will likely get scant air time between now and the Nov. 8 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if our economy is of any importance, it'll benefit voters to take a hard look at what's happening across the Atlantic before heading to the polls. <BR></SPAN></P>
