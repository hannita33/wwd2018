<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If history is any guide -- and it often hasn't been in this unusual election year -- Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be in trouble if he fails to carry North Carolina in November's presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe that's why he tells Tar Heel residents they'll see him a lot this fall.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to be in North Carolina so much that you're going to get so sick and tired of me,&quot; the businessman-turned-Republican-nominee told a cheering crowd of supporters Monday at a fairground arena near the Wake Forest University football stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to win North Carolina,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Hillary Clinton and the Democrats held their convention in Philadelphia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spent two days in North Carolina telling voters that bad trade deals bleed their state of lifelong manufacturing jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In arguing that &quot;we're going to bring our jobs back to North Carolina,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> talks to a state that has been a key part of the Republican Party's &quot;Southern strategy&quot; for more than four decades -- where a changing economy and electorate make it a prime turnaround target for Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state's 15 electoral votes are essential for a Republican candidate seeking the 270 needed to win. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> needs North Carolina to get to 270 more than Clinton needs North Carolina to get to 270,&quot; said Ferrel Guillory, director of the Program on Public Life at the University of North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, he said, North Carolina is ripe for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade message: The state's blue-collar workers, many of them in the textile and furniture manufacturing industries, were hit hard by the financial crisis and recession of 2008. They are receptive to the Republican businessman's message that &quot;bad&quot; free-trade deals led to the loss of manufacturing jobs to other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;North Carolina used to be a tobacco and textile state -- and now both of them have been decimated,&quot; said Diana Gwyn, 58, a retired probation and parole officer from Mount Airy who likes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;law and order&quot; theme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade agreements are &quot;even affecting furniture manufacturing,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his rally in Winston-Salem, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attributed the state's lost manufacturing jobs to &quot;incompetent&quot; federal officials negotiating poor trade deals and allowing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to get away with unfair practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> touched on the economy during a speech Tuesday in Charlotte to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, telling veterans, &quot;Our terrible trade deals must be renegotiated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He discussed his plans to improve veterans health care, saying the country must &quot;never again break our sacred commitment&quot; to those who have fought for the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, only two Democratic presidential candidates have taken North Carolina: fellow Southerner Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Barack Obama in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton is trying to follow the Obama playbook, appealing to voters who have flooded into the state to fill the state's new economy, including research and development, pharmaceuticals and banking and finance. This month, she made her first joint appearance with President Obama in Charlotte, the city where the Democrats held their convention four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blasting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as lacking the qualifications and temperament to be president, Clinton told people in Charlotte, &quot;This election is our chance to say our country is better than this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rising numbers of college-educated white-collar workers, single women and minority voters propelled Obama to a narrow victory in North Carolina eight years ago. <BR></SPAN></P>
