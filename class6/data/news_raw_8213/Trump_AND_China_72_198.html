<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial markets in 2017 will likely be all about &quot;Trumponomics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moment Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was declared winner of the presidential election Nov. 8, Wall Street's script for where financial markets were headed in the new year underwent a major rewrite.  Stale 2017 market outlooks were torn up and  more bullish forecasts drawn up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the arrival of business-friendly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, coupled with a Republican sweep of Congress, added up to a bullish change agent the four Wall Street pros who took part in USA TODAY's 21st annual Investment Roundtable weren't necessarily expecting -- but which they now view as a mostly positive development for a U.S. stock market that has been in bull-market mode for nearly eight years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election is a game-changer,&quot; said Roundtable panelist David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs. The well-respected big-picture strategist, who hails from the same firm where several of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cabinet picks and advisors have worked, expects the so-called &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rally&quot; to extend into the new year. His call is for the broad Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index to climb as high as 2,400, or nearly 6.5% higher by the end of March. But he sees the market giving back and finishing 2017 at 2,300 (or +2%) as the reality of what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can get passed through Congress &quot;tempers&quot;  post-election market euphoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rupal Bhansali, chief investment officer of international and global equities at Ariel Investments, summed up the 180-degree political and economic shift this way: &quot;What we are essentially witnessing,&quot; the Roundtable panelist and five-star fund manager said, &quot;is a regime change. We had Reaganomics in the 1980s. We have Abenomics in Japan. Now we have Trumponomics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> platform is seen propelling the domestic economy to a faster growth rate and providing a boost to corporate earnings growth,  fuel that drives the stock market. The general outline of his plan, namely to slash the corporate tax rate to as low as 15% from 35%, do away with regulations  businesses' complain makes it difficult for them to grow, and spend $1 trillion over 10 years to rebuild the nation's infrastructure over 10 years is viewed as a template for growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am more optimistic,&quot; acknowledges Roundtable panelist Jeff Rottinghaus, manager of the five-star T. Rowe Price Large Cap Core Fund, adding </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy platform is &quot;very positive&quot; for the financial picture of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gavin Baker, manager of the five-star Fidelity OTC Fund, who says his investment focus is more about identifying the next great innovation in tech and profiting from it and less about forecasting market outcomes, says the financial math does add up for many stocks and sectors that could benefit from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> call for lower taxes and fewer regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's reasonably clear that with single-party control in Washington, D.C. that we are going to get tax reform and regulatory reform,&quot; Baker said. &quot;So if you are a domestically focused U.S. company with a tax rate that goes from, say, 40%, down to 25% (under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), that means your after-tax earnings go from 60% to 75%, which is a 25% increase in your company's earnings per share. That is real fundamental change. Similarly, if there is regulatory change that results in banks having to hold less capital, that (improves) their return profile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, there are potential headwinds. For one, Wall Street has yet to get many specifics on what kind of tax relief </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be able to push through for U.S. companies. Nor do investors know what regulations will be eliminated, or how much Congress will approve in terms of dollars to be spent on infrastructure, or what lawmakers will decide on how much to tax U.S. companies for profits sitting overseas and how that might motivate CEOs to repatriate some of that cash and bring it back to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could also upset markets by starting trade wars with trading partners such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mexico, as well as slapping tarrifs on incoming goods to the U.S. There's a strong chance </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won't get everything he wants -- nor will Wall Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's the Federal Reserve, which on Wednesday hiked short-term interest rates a quarter of a percentage point for the first time in 2016. &quot;The Fed is an enormous driver,&quot; Baker says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, at least one Roundtable panelist is betting on the end of political gridlock under one-party Republican rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lack of gridlock means a few things can move forward,&quot; Kostin says. &quot;It's like being in a traffic jam around </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in New York. When the barriers come down the cars can move.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
