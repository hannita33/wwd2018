</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 17 months, I've traveled this country and met countless Americans from every walk of life. Your hopes have become my hopes and your dreams have become my dreams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've been inspired on this journey by the millions of you who came to cheer a simple idea: that we can make America great again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing job-killing Obamacare -- Americans are experiencing soaring double-digit premium hikes, insurers are leaving, doctors are quitting, jobs are fleeing, and deductibles are through the roof.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also means immediately fixing our terrible trade deals, which have killed American jobs and crushed American incomes. This means renegotiating Bill and Hillary Clinton's disastrous NAFTA and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> deals that have deindustrialized the United States -- importing unemployment and exporting our wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It means we don't have to keep kids trapped in failing schools -- that we can give every parent the right to send their kids to the school of their choice, including millions of low-income African-American and Hispanic children who have been failed for generations by Democratic politicians like Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real change also means draining the swamp of corruption in Washington. We must fix a rigged system in which political insiders can break the law without consequence and where government officials put special interests above the national interest. If we want to make America great again, we must clean up this corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton has been the subject of an FBI criminal investigation into  many crimes against this nation. Were she ever to be elected, it would trigger an unprecedented constitutional crisis -- Hillary is likely to be under investigation for a long time, grinding our government to a halt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America has too many problems, too many things to fix, to mire our government in years of sordid corruption and criminal investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is time to cut our ties with the failed politicians of the past, and embrace a bright, new future for all of our people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what I'm offering in my Contract with the American Voter, a 100-day action plan to clean up corruption and bring change to Washington. It's there for you to read at www.TheTrumpContract.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my Contract with the American Voter, I offer a historic pro-growth plan to create 25 million good paying jobs. We will cut taxes on middle-class Americans by 35%. We will eliminate every needless job-killing regulation. We will repeal and replace catastrophic Obamacare with new reforms that dramatically expand choice, substantially lower costs, and significantly improve the quality of care. And we will end the offshoring of American jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my contract, I also offer a detailed plan to immediately secure the border, stop illegal immigration and keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Hillary has pledged &quot;open borders,&quot; mass amnesty, and a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. America's immigration officers described Hillary's extremist plan as &quot;the most radical immigration agenda proposal in U.S. history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will restore the constitutional rule of law and nominate Supreme Court justices who will do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, I pledge to fight for the right of every child in American to grow up in safety and peace, and undertake a national effort to bring jobs, security and prosperity to our inner cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am asking for your vote, and to be your champion in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together, we will take our government back from the special interests -- and we will Make America Great Again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the Republican nominee for president. <BR></SPAN></P>
