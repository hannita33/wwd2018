<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often what upends the stock market is when potential bad stuff that investors know about -- but underestimate and don't sufficiently guard against -- happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wall Street doesn't like surprises. Case in point: the stock market's negative reaction to Wednesday's surprise announcement by the Federal Reserve that a June interest rate hike is still on the table if the economy perks up in the current quarter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 91 points Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A possible increase in borrowing costs just four weeks from now was &quot;not priced into the market.&quot; Investors were caught off guard, and their portfolios were positioned for a very different interest rate scenario.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Wall Street at the start of the week was pricing in a nearly 0% probability of a June hike. Since the release of the minutes of the Fed's April meeting, investors are now pricing in a 1-in-4 chance of a hike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that raises the question: What other risks are investors downplaying that could end up blowing a hole in their portfolios?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.Not one, not two, but three rate hikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three Fed rate increases in 2016 would catch investors way offsides, says Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. &quot;The market is unprepared for that aggressive of a Fed move,&quot; Luschini told USA TODAY. The worry is the Fed  makes a policy mistake that will tip the fragile U.S. economy into recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.A real-life &quot;Brexit.&quot; Britain leaving the 28-country European Union is a real possibility. But Wall Street is betting the Brits will vote &quot;no&quot; June 23 and opt to stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If investors are wrong and a Brexit happens, markets could turn tumultuous, perhaps causing more havoc than had Greece voted to leave the eurozone, warns Nick Sargen, senior investment adviser at Fort Washington Investment Advisors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the upset occurred, U.K. and global markets would sell off,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wall Street still sees Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton -- a well-known entity -- winning the presidential election in November. But Republican front-runner Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could surprise everyone again and take the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The biggest risk not being factored into markets is a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory,&quot; Sargen says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Americans do not realize how terrible his image is to those outside the U.S.,&quot; he says. &quot;Therefore, I would expect considerable foreign selling of U.S. securities over time, especially if he continued his threat about a trade war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Wall Street pro says the biggest surprise could actually be to the upside, as markets are pricing in nothing but doom and gloom at the moment, says Richard Bernstein, CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors. <BR></SPAN></P>
