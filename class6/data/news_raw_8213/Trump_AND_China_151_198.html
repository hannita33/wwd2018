<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its forecast for economic growth in the U.S. and other advanced economies, citing increasing risks from isolationist sentiment, but upgraded its outlook for emerging markets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the offsetting dynamics, the IMF left its global growth estimate unchanged from its July projection at 3.1% this year and 3.4% in 2017 and renewed its call for more forceful government action to fuel economic activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Taken as a whole, the world economy is moving sideways,&quot; IMF Economic Counselor Maurice Obstfeld said at a news conference at the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the U.S., the IMF lowered its growth estimate to 1.6% this year and 2.2% in 2017, down from 2.2% and 2.5%, respectively, in July. The agency cited weaker-than-expected growth of 1.1% at an annual rate in the second quarter as continued sluggish business investment and stockpiling offset solid consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund traced the soft capital spending to the energy sector downturn, the negative effects of a strong dollar on exports and &quot;possibly also the financial market volatility and recession fears of late 2015 and early 2016.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advanced economies overall, which include Europe and Japan, are also expected to grow 1.6% this year, down from the July projection of 1.8%. The IMF estimates advanced countries will expand by 1.8% next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IMF modestly marked down its global outlook in July after the United Kingdom's Brexit vote raised the prospect of disrupted trade relationships. On the bright side, the agency said market reaction to the vote &quot;has generally been contained,&quot; with stocks recovering after an initial sell-off. But the agency added in a report Brexit &quot;is very much an unfolding event.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. and Europe also have been hampered by weak productivity growth, aging populations and income gains that have largely flowed to the highest earners, the IMF said. The latter trend has stoked an isolationist movement that could further hamper economies in those regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The result in some richer countries has been a political movement that blames globalization for all woes and seeks somehow to wall of the economy from global trends rather than to engage productively with foreign nations,&quot; Obstfeld said. He added that such an effort is &quot;likely to depress global growth further.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That isolationist sentiment has been reflected in Europe by the Brexit vote and in the U.S. by the presidential election, the agency said. Both Republican Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Democrat Hillary Clinton have espoused anti-trade policies to different degrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Offsetting the dimmer picture in advanced economies is a more favorable outlook in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other emerging markets. Although </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economy continues to grapple with a challenging shift in focus from investment to consumption, concerns about the country's near-term prospects have eased after the government's decision to keep interest rates low and strong credit growth, the IMF said. It expects </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to to grow 6.6% this year and 6.2% in 2017, unchanged from July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the IMF estimates emerging markets overall will expand by 4.2%, up from its 4.1% forecast in July. <BR></SPAN></P>
