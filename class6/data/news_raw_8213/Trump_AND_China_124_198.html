<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America decided, and people around the world made it clear they thought it was the wrong decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> entered the 2016 presidential race as an underdog. His surprise victory over Hillary Clinton prompted foreign observers to say that their worst fears about the contentious U.S. election were realized.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After Brexit and this election, anything is now possible. A world is crumbling before our eyes. Vertigo,&quot; France's ambassador to the United States, Gerard Araud, tweeted as it became clear that the billionaire businessman and reality TV star would win the world's most powerful post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Araud's reference to Britain's exit from the European Union -- the Brexit -- was a nod to another vote, also fought on a political battlefield that pitted the political establishment's support for open borders and global trade against strong populist support for nationalism and isolation. In both cases, voters upended pollsters' and pundits' predictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not just about him. It's about who he will, and has, emboldened,&quot; said Samantha Shannon, a popular British writer. &quot;Everything about this feels identical to Brexit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has touted a vision of a more isolationist American foreign policy that would represent a fundamental break with decades of internationalism. His proposals include making U.S. military support for NATO, a cornerstone of global security since World War II, conditioned on the financial support of the alliance's members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese state media were quick to cast the election as the embodiment of America's democracy in crisis in contrast to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> perceived stability under authoritarian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The majority of Americans are rebelling against the U.S.'s political class and financial elites,&quot; the official Communist Party newspaper People's Daily said in a commentary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Russia, where the government has been accused by U.S. intelligence officials of trying to meddle in the election through cyber mischief, Muscovite Alexei Anatsky, who works in the IT industry, said, &quot;Real life is turning out far less funny than it seemed a while ago. We had an idea of how people think in New York and San Francisco. Now we are seeing how more than half of the country thinks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global markets expressed shock at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> win. Dow stock futures on Wall Street plunged more than 4% before recovering. In Tokyo, the Nikkei index nosedived 5.4%, its largest drop in years. European shares also plummeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mexican peso started plunging as soon as it became clear that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had won the key battleground states of Florida, Ohio and North Carolina -- indicators of his eventual victory. Mexico's central bank had called a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> win a possible &quot;hurricane&quot; for the peso and created a contingency plan to respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has referred to some Mexican migrants as rapists and criminals and vowed to build a wall along the U.S. border paid for by Mexico, a pledge that has angered many Mexicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The entire country is shocked,&quot; said Esteban Illades, a magazine editor.</SPAN></P>
