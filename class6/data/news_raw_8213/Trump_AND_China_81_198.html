<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has mocked and decried the nuclear deal the Obama administration negotiated with Iran ever since he started running for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 2015, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he would &quot;renegotiate&quot; the agreement, reached two months earlier, which curtailed Iran's nuclear program to peaceful activities in return for the lifting of crippling sanctions over time. Last month, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Iran &quot;should write us a letter of thank you&quot; for &quot;the stupidest deal of all time.&quot; Vice President-elect Mike Pence said the deal would be &quot;ripped up&quot; after consultation with U.S. allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shred it if he wants to?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, State Department spokesman Mark Toner confirmed. &quot;The agreement is valid only as long as all parties uphold it,&quot; he said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The threats from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his team were enough to prompt Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to issue statements about the future of the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. It cannot be changed by one government's decision, Rouhani insisted Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iran exercised prudence concerning the nuclear agreement as it confirmed JCPOA as a U.N. Security Council Resolution, not as an agreement with one government,&quot; he said, according to the government-controlled Iranian Students News Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nuclear deal was reached between the United States, Russia, Britain, France and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- plus Germany. All approved it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zarif urged the American president-elect to face the reality of regional and international affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality is that Iran was brought to the bargaining table with the help of sanctions imposed by the United States, the U.N. Security Council and the European Union at the urging of the Obama administration and Congress. Russia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and U.S. allies in Europe have started doing business with oil-rich Iran since the deal was inked, and they hope for more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European countries have lifted sanctions. Iran has made deals to expand its oil fields, build cars and buy dozens of aircraft from the EU's Airbus and Boeing in the USA. Russia is deploying anti-aircraft systems to Iran. The United States released its hold on tens of billions of dollars in Iranian oil revenue that had been frozen in foreign bank accounts. Iran's once depressed economy is enjoying a moderate recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iran has expanded its policy of supporting Shiite militias in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon. In Iraq, the militias are battling the Islamic State, a Sunni group that both Shiite-dominated Iran and the Unitd States consider an enemy. In Syria, the militias are mostly fighting U.S.-backed anti-government rebels, and in Yemen, they're fighting the U.S.- and Saudi-backed government. Pulling out of the deal could risk exacerbating these conflicts or lifting the constraints on Iran's nuclear program when it is expanding its economy and military activities abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toner said State Department officials will explain the merits of the deal to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team, though any decision about sticking to the terms of the agreement would be up to the next administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary of State John Kerry and the Obama administration &quot;feel very strongly the Iran deal has worked,&quot; Toner said. &quot;It prevented Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon in a short period of time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It provided for increased and more intrusive monitoring by the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, he said. The agreement required the approval of lawmakers from every country that signed it, including the GOP-controlled U.S. Congress and the Iranian parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> announced he would not honor the agreement, &quot;all U.S. sanctions that have been lifted or suspended are going to be reimposed by executive order,&quot; said Mark Dubowitz,  executive director of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. <BR></SPAN></P>
