<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the biggest complaints fueling 2016 voter rage is the idea that the USA has hemorrhaged jobs to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mexico while politicians ignored workers' pain. Some presidential candidates have plans to fix that, none bolder or more specific than Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who says that when he's president, he'll bring jobs back.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said  this month. &quot;How does it help us when they make it in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like a lot of what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says, reality is not nearly so simple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For starters, a president can't order a private company to move manufacturing home. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> talks about slapping tariffs of 35% to 45% on imports to force companies to build things here, but he'd have to get Congress to agree. Some jobs might eventually come home, but not before other countries retaliated. In the meantime, consumers would pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> isn't the first to wonder why Apple can't make its iconic cellphones here. During a 2011 dinner with Silicon Valley executives, President Obama asked then-Apple chief Steve Jobs what it would take to bring those jobs home. According to The New York Times, Jobs' reply was blunt: &quot;Those jobs aren't coming back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why not? Lower wages are only part of the answer.  Estimates of the added cost of building the iPhone in the USA are as little as $50  -- not much extra for a $700 iPhone. But the numerous parts that make up an iPhone are principally made abroad, mostly in Asia. And </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has developed a skilled, flexible workforce that would be difficult to replicate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless, the vast majority of the value of an iPhone starts and stays in the USA, where the phone is designed and marketed. Key parts are U.S.-made, including the crucial A9 chip (Texas) and the scratchproof glass (Kentucky).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such logic is cold comfort to someone losing a job, such as the 2,100 workers in Indiana whose work will disappear  as Carrier moves its furnace manufacturing to Mexico in the coming years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often, defending free trade is hard because Carrier workers are visible, but beneficiaries are diffuse. Not in Indiana. The state has 100,000 manufacturing jobs in foreign-owned businesses, including more than 2,000 at a Honda plant built in 2006.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, while </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was decrying American weakness, Honda invested $52 million in American strength with plans to hire an additional 100 workers. Since 2014, Japanese auto firms, including Toyota and Subaru, announced as many new jobs in Indiana as Carrier plans to send to Mexico. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might have missed it, but starting in 2013, Honda's factories in Indiana, Ohio, Alabama and Georgia churned out more cars for export than Honda imported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a dynamic reflected nationwide, where foreign-owned businesses spend far more in the USA every year to create manufacturing jobs than leaves the country to create factory jobs outside U.S. borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States manufacturers and workers are not the trade loser </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> imagines. That's no thanks to Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: A tweet with a photo of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brand suit recently went viral. The label inside says, &quot;Made in Mexico.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
