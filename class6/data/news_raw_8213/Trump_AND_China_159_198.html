<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former British prime minister Tony Blair warned that political upheaval -- from Great Britain's Brexit vote in June to the collapse of the Italian government Sunday -- signals the most dangerous time for Western democracies in decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It does feel perilous, actually, because I think there are decisions that are being taken of vast moment in circumstances where systems are fragile,&quot; he told Capital Download on Monday. &quot;And that is troubling.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been a year of unexpected victories by populist and nationalistic forces challenging the establishment: passage of the referendum pulling Britain from the European Union, the election of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as president in the USA, defeat of a measure in Italy that prompted the prime minister to announce his resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an Austrian election Sunday, the candidate representing a party founded by former Nazis lost -- but after commanding 46% of the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blair, who was in Washington to address a conference sponsored by the bipartisan group No Labels, announced last week the launch of an organization that will try to help build a more muscular policy agenda for centrists and encourage networking among them across Europe, in the USA and elsewhere. Given the rise of extreme voices on the left and right, he said, &quot;I'm not sure we're asking the right questions right now, never mind giving the right answers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of particular concern to him is a &quot;longing&quot; for an authoritarian leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's amazing how many people you will find who will reference a style of leadership of (Russian) President Putin in a positive way,&quot; he told USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series. &quot;I think people want their country moving, and they think that if the present system is not moving it and not making the changes that they want to see, then maybe someone who just says, 'I don't care what anyone thinks; I'm just going to go for it, and this is what I'm going to do' -- that has a certain attraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the center isn't a place of strength and vitality, and it looks kind of flabby and just managing the status quo, then you're at risk of someone coming along and doing that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech to the No Labels conference, he faulted some centrist political leaders for failing to  improve the economic prospects for workers disrupted by globalization and to ensure a sense of personal safety as Great Britain and other European countries have absorbed a wave of immigrants from Syria. &quot;People will only put aside prejudices if they think there are rules,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blair sees a common thread from the Brexit's passage to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election to support for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, a provocative figure whose anti-drug campaign is blamed for thousands of deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is immense amount of anger at established ways of doing things,&quot; Blair said. &quot;There is, I think, a whole group of people who feel ignored by those in power. ... There is more anger around in politics than for a long time.&quot; Though issues such as immigration aren't new, there is &quot;much greater skepticism towards globalization and the benefits of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's more, &quot;social media is a revolutionary phenomenon,&quot; he went on. &quot;It changes the way politics works. It changes the way the media works. If we're not careful, it locks people into conversations with people who just agree with them and who then have a general conspiracy-theory view of the rest of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blair hasn't met </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and didn't criticize him. Asked whether it was wise for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to accept a congratulatory telephone call from Taiwan's president -- the sort of conversation every American president since 1979  has avoided to keep from angering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which claims Taiwan as its territory -- Blair demurred. &quot;I'm not going to get into your politics,&quot; he said. &quot;To be honest, in the end, I'll tell you what I really think: Let's see how it works out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm less worried about America than I am about Europe; I'll be very frank with you,&quot; he said. &quot;America is such a strong country, and you've got so many checks-and-balances and you've got such resilience in your economy and so on; you guys will do fine, I'm sure. In Europe, we have systems that are at a point of fragility that troubles me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blair was 54 years old when he moved out of No. 10 Downing St. after serving as prime minister from 1997 to 2007. His political appeal for a &quot;new way&quot; was akin to President Bill Clinton's &quot;third way&quot; for Democrats, and he was a crucial ally for President George W. Bush during the Iraq War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He offered a bit of free advice for President Obama, who will move out the White House next month at age 55: Find a cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you've got young political leaders and then they leave office young, you've got to find something that really motivates you,&quot; he said. &quot;The reason I spent so much time on the Middle East is that I'm deeply motivated by it. But you've got to find something that gets you up in the morning with the same sense of purpose and excitement as happened when you were prime minister or president.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
