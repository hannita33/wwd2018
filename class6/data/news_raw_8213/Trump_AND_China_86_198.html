</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emotions are complex driving hundreds of thousands of women, many first-time activists arriving on Greyhound buses from as far away as Miami and Baton Rouge, to march on Washington the day after Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inauguration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it starts with this: It's still better to be a man in America, and sexism remains a problem in society. That's according to the first major survey on gender since the November election, by the non-partisan research firm PerryUndem, finding a majority of women feel this way.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's broad public consensus among both genders that work remains to be done in securing women's rights, including equal pay and paid family leave; yet the male Republican voters who elected </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- and who'll now hold the reins of power in Washington -- are the least likely to see sexism, violence against women, unequal care-giving responsibilities, racism, access to abortion and birth control as contributors to inequality, the survey found. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cabinet so far is 90% male and 90% white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The State of the Union on Gender Equality, Sexism and Women's Rights,&quot; helps explain why so many Americans have chosen this moment in history to demonstrate. While men will participate in the Saturday march, according to the bus and train platform Wanderu, 81% of travelers to Washington  are women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The single biggest contributor to this peaking civic participation is the president-elect's comments and past behavior toward women, according to the survey. It ranks negative feelings about his actions as more predictive of getting politically involved than ideology, age, gender, race, education and geography.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a pretty big finding and pretty much explains how the women's march organically arose and is happening now,&quot; said Tresa Undem, the lead pollster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey of 1,302 adults was conducted Dec. 9-27. Forty-three percent of participants voted for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and 46% for Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is no surprise that the Women's March has adopted Clinton's 1995 declaration in Beijing as its battle cry: &quot;Women's rights are human rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not just Hillary didn't win. It's wow, there's real potential here for us to lose some things we've worked for,&quot; said Jean Harris, an expert in feminist history at the University of Scranton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we are saying is that we cannot and will not be ignored,&quot; said Janaye Ingram, logistics director for the march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> win, two-thirds of survey participants say they're doing things differently, including six in 10 who say they're either paying more attention to elected officials' actions, donating to an organization or getting involved in a direct political action in response to the election. Thirty-two percent feel less tolerant of perceived sexism in their own lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news is there's broad agreement -- 83% -- that it's important that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Congress work to move forward on issues around women's rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge this group faces is that the incoming administration is the least likely to perceive gender inequality, the survey found. The problem is connecting action to policy. &quot;If Republican leadership in the new administration and Congress reflect Republican men in the population, they may not see connections between several policy issues and gender equality,&quot; the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fewer than half of Republican men saw sexism, violence against women, unequal care giving responsibilities, racism, access to abortion and birth control as factors. Only one in four Republican men said lack of women in political office affects women's rights and equality. Of male </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> voters, 32% said in general men make better political leaders and 38% disagree that the country would be better off with more women in political office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is in this context that the survey broached the issue that was just below the surface for much of the 2016 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One in three respondents said they think sexism prevented Clinton from winning, while one in four saw or heard friends or family members make sexist comments about her during the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, one-third of men and women who voted for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> disagree that the country would be better off with more women in political office. <BR></SPAN></P>
