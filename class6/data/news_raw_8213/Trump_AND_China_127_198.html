<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If elephants could trumpet for joy, there would have been a resounding crescendo Dec. 30 when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> announced that it will close its domestic commercial ivory market this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2015, Presidents Xi Jinping and Obama stood together and announced their intention to close their respective ivory markets. America implemented a near total ban last June.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade between countries is already prohibited, and now </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision to cease domestic commercial ivory sales adds much needed teeth to that ban. Additionally, law enforcement efforts to stop the illegal trade will be enhanced along with public education on the ecological damage of purchasing ivory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservationists have called the Chinese ban a game changer, with ivory traffickers now staring at a giant &quot;out of business&quot; sign by their largest customer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Union for Conservation of Nature has voted  to urge all governments to close their domestic ivory markets. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) has adopted a resolution recommending the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seeds of this global movement began 28 years ago when, as secretary of State under President George H.W. Bush, I was proud to have been part of American leadership in an effort to ban the international ivory trade through CITES.  Elephant numbers, which had been declining steadily due to poaching, began to stabilize. Over time, however, the ban was weakened and undermined through approval of one-off sales of ivory stockpiles, as well as the development of a thriving black market trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coupled with growing wealth in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the increased demand for luxury goods such as ivory, traffickers and organized crime networks began wholesale slaughtering of elephants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Wildlife Conservation Society, this has resulted in as many as 35,000 elephants killed annually -- or 96 a day. A recent census puts the number of African elephants at 400,000, down from 1.2 million three decades ago. It's estimated that forest elephants, which are restricted to the Congo Basin in Central Africa, will need 100 years to recover from an onslaught of poaching that began in 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> moves to implement its market closure, we need to ensure that  bans are policed effectively. Further, more resources are needed to stop the killings and put the traffickers out of business. Other countries with legal domestic ivory markets should follow </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lead and close their markets, particularly Japan and other Asian countries where demand for ivory is high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be a crime if future generations had to live in a world without elephants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I applaud </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and encourage it to strongly enforce its ban. And I urge the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration to restore the bipartisan efforts and American leadership that will help elephant populations begin the long road to recovery.</SPAN></P>
