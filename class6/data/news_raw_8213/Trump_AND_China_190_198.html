<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detroit's historic bankruptcy should serve as a wake-up call to U.S. politicians who are ignoring a national debt crisis that could  threaten the livelihoods of millions of American retirees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Republican presidential candidates hit the Motor City on Thursday for a Fox News debate -- and as the two remaining Democratic candidates  campaign there before Tuesday's Michigan primary -- it's critical to understand why Detroit's financial collapse should be a red flag for America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detroit's remarkable escape from $7 billion in debt finally put the well-being of its 688,000 residents before its 170,000 creditors, as documented in my upcoming book. But the city's debt crisis offers a crucial lesson for presidential candidates on the importance of shoring up the nation's balance sheet to ensure that, unlike in Detroit, benefits are preserved for American retirees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For starters, government debt at the local, state and national levels is much higher than you've been told. In Detroit, the city owed only about $1.1 billion in traditional unsecured bonds. But it owed about 10 times more to its retirees through unfunded pension debt, retiree health care obligations and pension bonds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By comparison, the national debt -- at least the figure you usually hear -- is about $19.1 trillion. But that number does not include the true cost of benefits. It turns out the U.S. government has promised an astounding $41.9 trillion in Social Security, Medicare and other retiree benefits over the next 75 years that it cannot pay for under current revenue projections, according to the Treasury Department's Sept. 30, 2014, Statements of Social Insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken together, that means the true national debt is $61 trillion. That's more than three times U.S. gross domestic product, and it reflects a debt-to-income ratio of about 19-to-1 based on current government revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Detroit, the debt-to-income ratio when it filed for bankruptcy was about 18-to-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a consequence of the city's  collapse, 32,000 retirees paid the price for unrealistic promises -- pension cuts of up to 20% and a  90% cut in health care benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ensure the next president is prepared to address this issue, here are three key questions that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Kasich, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders must be prepared to answer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How will you fix Social Security: tax increases, benefit cuts, privatization or some mix of the above? Don't say doing nothing is an option. If you want to connect with Millennials, it's time to deliver answers. A 2014 Pew Research study found that 51% of Millennials believe they will receive no Social Security benefits when they retire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it possible to balance the  budget without dramatic changes to Medicare or tax increases? Expenditures on Social Security, Medicare and other health and employment programs represented 60% of the  government's 2015 spending, according to the National Priorities Project.  Some form of tax increases, benefit cuts or a total overhaul of the  health care system is required. Choose a path, but don't ignore reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does a global debt binge pose a threat to our economic security? If the answer is no, how do we explain the near collapse of Greece, the debt crisis in Puerto Rico, bulging liabilities in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- and the corresponding economic troubles there?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 2015 McKinsey study found that from the end of 2007 through the end of 2014, global debt grew by $57 trillion, as the rate of new governmental debt added annually increased by 60% to 9.3% of GDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news in Detroit is that the city is moving in the opposite direction. After a bipartisan bankruptcy settlement dubbed the &quot;grand bargain&quot; -- which won the approval of Republicans and Democrats in the state legislature, as well as Wall Street lenders and retirees -- the city's budget is balanced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's quite an  achievement for a city that had been bleeding cash for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important, the mayor and the City Council are working together to invest in public safety, turn the street lights back on and tear down abandoned homes, using cash flow that was previously diverted to creditors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detroit has a second chance at life, but it came in part at the expense of its vulnerable pensioners. Thankfully, it's not too late to protect American retirees. But it's long past time for a more serious national conversation about the policies necessary to shore up the social safety net.</SPAN></P>
