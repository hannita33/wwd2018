<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While preparing to fill more Cabinet slots, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Monday tapped Ben Carson for secretary of Housing and Urban Development, met with former vice president Al Gore, and expanded his search for a secretary of State amid new friction with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect formally confirmed weeks-long plans to nominate Carson, saying the retired neurosurgeon and former Republican primary rival has a &quot;brilliant mind&quot; and is &quot;passionate&quot; about meeting the challenges facing the nation's cities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have talked at length about my urban renewal agenda and our message of economic revival, very much including our inner cities,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. &quot;Ben shares my optimism about the future of our country and is part of ensuring that this is a Presidency representing all Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carson, who at one point demurred about joining </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cabinet, said: &quot;I feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly by strengthening communities that are most in need. We have much work to do in enhancing every aspect of our nation and ensuring that our nation's housing needs are met.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Republican primary campaign, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attacked Carson, referring to him at one point as &quot;pathological.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats denounced the former doctor and prominent social conservative. The Senate must confirm Carson's nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Carson &quot;is a disconcerting and disturbingly unqualified choice to lead a department as complex and consequential as Housing and Urban Development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition spokesman Jason Miller said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will formally unveil his secretary of Defense nominee -- retired Marine Corps general James Mattis -- at a rally Tuesday in Fayetteville, N.C.; the stop will be the second of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Thank You Tour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on the  schedule:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting between Gore and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; the ex-vice president also spoke with Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the president-elect's daughter. One topic: Climate change, reportedly one of Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> top concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterward, Gore said he had &quot;a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect,&quot; who has been skeptical of climate change concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Tuesday schedule that include meetings with Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, mentioned as a U.S. ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; and radio talk show host Laura Ingraham, a potential press secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two more &quot;Thank You Tour&quot; stops this week: Thursday in Des Moines, and Friday in Grand Rapids, Mich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcements come as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> expands his search for secretary of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After saying that he had narrowed his search -- former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, ex-New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker and ex-CIA director David Petraeus -- aides said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is looking at more names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among new names: ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who will be interviewed Tuesday, and former ambassador Jon Huntsman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One challenge facing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> diplomatic team: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protested </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> phone call Friday with the president of Taiwan, the president-elect criticized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a pair of tweets Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea?&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. &quot;I don't think so!&quot;</SPAN></P>
