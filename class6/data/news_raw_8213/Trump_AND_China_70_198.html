<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican presidential candidate Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he was open to the idea of holding nuclear talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a move that would signal a sharp shift in American diplomatic policy toward the isolated Asian country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would speak to him. I would have no problem speaking to him,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. The presumptive GOP nominee also said he would put pressure on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, one of the few nations to support Pyongyang economically and financially, to try to stop North Korea's nuclear program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can solve that problem with one meeting or one phone call,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. He made the comments during an interview Tuesday with the Reuters news agency in his office at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in New York. He did not elaborate on whether he would propose bilateral talks with delegations from the United States and North Korea or a meeting between two leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior officials in President Obama's administration are in touch with their counterparts in North Korea, but there is no contact at the presidential level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No serving U.S. president has ever met with a North Korean leader, although Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton met with predecessors of Kim Jong Un after they left office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Korea held nuclear tests in 2006, 2009, 2013 and 2016, according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a global security organization. Those tests have led to a series of sanctions by the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jake Sullivan, an adviser to Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, pounced on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let me get this straight,&quot; Sullivan said. &quot;Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> insults the leader of our closest ally, then turns around and says he'd love to talk to Kim Jong Un?&quot; Sullivan was referring to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recent feud with British Prime Minister David Cameron, who has refused to back down from calling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposed Muslim ban &quot;divisive, stupid and wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hit back at Cameron this week, saying it &quot;looks like we're not going to have a very good relationship.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
