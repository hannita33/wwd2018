</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says it's &quot;ridiculous&quot; to believe Moscow helped him win the presidency, and he rejects intelligence findings that Russia intervened in the U.S. election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's just another excuse,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in an interview aired on Fox News Sunday. &quot;I don't believe it. ... Every week it's another excuse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the interview, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also appeared to reject the idea of setting up a blind trust to manage his assets during his presidency, saying that his &quot;executives&quot; and his children would run his companies in his absence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats and some Republicans have called for hearings and investigations into the CIA's conclusion that Russia authorized hacking and other tactics in order to help </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and hurt Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton during the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., issued a joint statement Sunday with incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., calling for a bipartisan effort to explore the allegations and defend the nation against cyberattacks. The two were joined by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. and Sen, Jack Reed, D-R.I., the bipartisan leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For years, foreign adversaries have directed cyberattacks at America's physical, economic, and military infrastructure, while stealing our intellectual property,&quot; their statement said. &quot;Now our democratic institutions have been targeted. Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his Fox interview, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Democrats are pushing the idea of Russian involvement in an effort to explain their surprise election loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said there's no way to know if Russia was behind the hacking of e-mail accounts belonging to Democratic and Clinton campaign officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once they hack if you don't catch them in the act you're not going to catch them,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. &quot;They have no idea if it's Russia or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or somebody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia is believed to be a topic of presidential intelligence briefings, though </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not receive them every day. He told Fox News Sunday that he receives the briefing &quot;when I need it,&quot; because it tends to the same information day-to-day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, noting that Vice President-elect Mike Pence is receiving frequent briefings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told Fox that &quot;very good people&quot; do the briefings, and he has told them: &quot;'If something should change from this point, immediately call me. I'm available on one-minute's notice.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other parts of the interview, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executives and his children will run his various companies. The New York City businessman said liquidating his assets and placing the proceeds in a blind trust would be impractical and time-consuming because so much his business involves real estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know, when you sell real estate that's not like going out and selling a stock,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. &quot;That takes a long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;My executives will run it with my children. It's a big company, it's a great company. But I'm going to have nothing to do with management.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dismissed suggestions that foreign governments and others would try to buy influence by buying into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> products, such as staying at his new hotel in downtown Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His focus is on being president, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, and he has rejected business deals in the wake of his political campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I turned down seven deals with one big player, great player, last week, because I thought it could be perceived as a conflict of interest,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is &quot;open-minded&quot; about human impact on climate change, and what can be done about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, I'm somebody that gets it and nobody really knows,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. &quot;It's not something that's so hard and fast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he is &quot;studying&quot; the Paris climate change agreement with other countries, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> indicated he would restart the Keystone and the Dakota Access pipelines after he takes office Jan. 20. The Obama administration blocked both pipelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is &quot;getting very close&quot; to naming a secretary of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides have identified ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as a leading candidate for the State Department post. Asked about Tillerson, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that he's &quot;much more than a business executive,&quot; and knows government officials around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He knows many of the players, and he knows them well,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. &quot;He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company -- not for himself -- for the company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took to Twitter on Sunday morning to say he has not made a final decision: &quot;Whether I choose him or not for 'State'- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman &amp; CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taiwan's president called him to congratulate him, and that it would have been &quot;disrespectful&quot; to have turned down the offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> objections to the call, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggested he is not necessarily bound by the decades-old &quot;one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; policy in which the U.S. recognizes only the government of mainland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know why we have to be bound by a one-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy unless we make a deal with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> having to do with other things, including trade,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. <BR></SPAN></P>
