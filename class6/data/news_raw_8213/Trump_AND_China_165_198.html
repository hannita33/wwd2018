<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama met last week with leaders from Japan, South Korea and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to discuss nuclear threats from North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest danger of Kim Jong Un having nukes is not him placing them on missiles but him giving them to IslamicState terrorists. - Vincent Wolf</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, we will have to wait for the next president to decide what to do with North Korea. This one will do zero. - Frank Wilson Harding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doing nothing is better than starting a nuclear war with a deranged dictator. Hopefully, the next president will be as tactful as our current one. What would you prefer, another quagmire war that creates another ISIL? - Andrew Jason Neumann</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if North Koreans had the ability to hit Washington with a nuclear warhead, they would never do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has them on a leash, and their military is half-starved. Kim knows well that if he ever attacked Seoul or Washington, it would be the end of the Kim regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I pretty much think the American people can rest their heads at night without worrying about Kim actually going ahead with his threats. I, for one, will. - Matthew Pettipas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Korea is the most dangerous threat to U.S. national security. The country is run by an isolated kook whose main political agenda appears to be  destroying the USA. - Christopher Dunn</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOREIGN THREATS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What country do you consider to be the United States' greatest enemy? Top replies:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm no psychologist, but common sense tells me that the first step in doing something is to say you're going to do it. It seems that if a pipsqueak is ignored, he will only increase his misbehavior in order to gain our attention so as to be recognized as one of the big boys (&quot;Obama, Asian leaders huddle on region's concerns,&quot; News, Friday).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Threats should always be taken seriously (especially from crazy people). I'd say, because we can't send Kim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jong Un to bed without dinner, we stomp on him like a grape. In the words of that great philosopher Barney</SPAN></P>
