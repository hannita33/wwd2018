<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kellyanne Conway, one of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> top advisers, questioned on Monday whether additional investigations are needed into reports of Russian hacking during the campaign and indicated the incoming president may reconsider some of the punitive actions President Obama ordered in response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I predict that President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will want to make sure that our actions are proportionate to what occurred, based on what we know,&quot; she told Capital Download.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the steps Obama took, including ejecting 35 alleged Russian spies, were harsher than those he ordered after reported hacking by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and North Korea and suggested the reason for the difference was political.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conway ridiculed a proposal by House and Senate Democrats on Monday to establish a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate the allegations against Russia. U.S. intelligence agencies reported last week that Moscow, under the direction of President Vladimir Putin, hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, then leaked them in an effort to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton and elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has supported investigations by the House and Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's curious and a little bit humorous that Democrats would talk about anything bipartisan ... given how they have vowed to obstruct everything we do,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There already was &quot;a great deal of information out there&quot; about the hacking, she said. &quot;I do find it to be very ironic that the uptick and the hue-and-cry of 'investigation' and 'information' has occurred after the election results are in. ... The fact is, the Democrats became super-duper interested in this entire issue after the election did not go the way they, quote, wanted and the way they expected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans also have raised concerns about Russia's actions. Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have called for the imposition of tougher sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conway, 49, was campaign manager last year for candidate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. She became the first woman to run a winning presidential bid and is slated to be a senior White House adviser for President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after he is inaugurated Jan. 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A veteran Republican pollster and strategist, she has emerged as one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most combative and public defenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She spoke with USA TODAY's video newsmaker series at the beginning of a crucial week. Obama is scheduled to deliver a farewell address in Chicago on Tuesday. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is slated to hold his first news conference as president-elect Wednesday. The Senate plans confirmation hearings for as many as nine of his Cabinet appointees this week, including attorney general-designate Jeff Sessions and secretary of State-designate Rex Tillerson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conway said she had &quot;hardly thought about&quot; the Women's March on Washington, which is likely to draw thousands of protesters to the National Mall the day after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is sworn in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every single issue and criticism was fully vetted and explored many times over in this election,&quot; she said. Though she said she respected their right to protest, &quot;I would like them to reconsider and perhaps just try to sit down and figure out how to work with their president and their vice president, because he is their president and their vice president, no matter what their hashtags say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some hashtags on Twitter declare #notmypresident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In discussing the outgoing president, Conway said she &quot;absolutely&quot; would watch Obama's farewell address in Chicago on Tuesday -- but she gave what sounded like a warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a great idea for him to do this because he knows that a great deal of what he did is not going to survive this next presidency, or maybe even this next month, in some cases,&quot; she said. &quot;You build a legacy not just by checking a box and passing legislation without a single vote from the other side. Legacies have to be sustained over time; they have to endure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She questioned whether Obama, once he leaves the Oval Office, should lead Democrats in critiquing his successor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's appropriate for any past president to weigh in as they feel comfortable and as appropriate,&quot; she said, then added, &quot;I do recall that President George W. Bush gave a great deal of latitude and courtesy to President Obama and basically said, 'I'm not the president anymore; give him his chance to run the country.' We'd like the same.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
