<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stocks and politics could be setting up for a collision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Improving business conditions and a U.S. stock market flirting with record highs are now trumping risks related to presidential politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Clinton v. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign showdown could still cause problems for the economy and anxious moments for financial markets in coming months as the polls shift back and forth, feared policy proposals gain traction and Election Day nears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warnings of the potential for politically driven tumult are starting to pop up on a regular basis, in terms of:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic growth expectations. Economists polled by the National Association for Business Economics  lowered their 2016 U.S. growth estimate to 1.8%, down from 2.2% in March. And 60% of economists cited &quot;uncertainty surrounding the upcoming election&quot; as a reason for dialing back their GDP outlook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sentiment about the economy. Ethan Harris, global economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said in a report he's concerned about a &quot;confidence shock&quot; between next month's national party conventions and the Nov. 9 election if &quot;threats of tariffs and currency wars, deportation of immigrants, a large expansion of the budget deficit, and talk about the economy and markets being in a bubble&quot; continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employment plans. Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at The Economic Outlook Group, went as far as theorizing the dismal May jobs report  could be due to business leaders &quot;pulling back on hiring and investments&quot; and &quot;turning hyper-cautious&quot; because of the lack of clarity surrounding the outlook for taxes, government spending, trade and foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the market angst surrounds Republican presumptive nominee Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, or what Baumohl refers to as &quot;The Trumpian Effect.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he will slap tariffs on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> imports to the U.S., build a wall along the Mexico-U.S. border and consider relieving Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen of her duties if he gets elected. The mere thought of a global trade war ratchets up Wall Street's angst meter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; says Greg Valliere, chief strategist at Horizon Investments, &quot;would be the mother of all uncertainty for markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wall Street still believes the best outcome for investors is a Hillary Clinton win with the Republicans holding on to at least one branch of Congress, so as to avoid a Democratic sweep and complete control of Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, the market is shrugging off the political sideshow and investors are bidding stock prices higher based on improving business conditions, says Jeremy Zirin, chief equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A big reason for the market's relative calm is a belief Clinton will capture the White House (a PredictWise poll,  closely followed by investors, puts the odds of the Democratic candidate topping the Republican at 73%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But market volatility could start to pick up if &quot;you start to see the gap close,&quot; which will &quot;inject more uncertainty into the election outcome,&quot; Zirin adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One way </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could rise in the polls is if Clinton is hurt by a downturn in the economy,  currently under the stewardship of outgoing two-term Democratic President Barack Obama, analysts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Valliere, who argues election risk has decreased in recent weeks due to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lower odds of winning due to his &quot;self-inflicted wounds,&quot; also believes any sign of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> surprise resurgence would spook markets: &quot;If he were to pull ahead markets would have to start to worry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason investors' angst level would increase is that some of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> more market-unfriendly policies, like his protectionist leanings and plans to pick a fight with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and impose tariffs, would start to &quot;look like they are becoming more likely,&quot; says Andy Laperriere, head of policy research at Cornerstone Macro. &quot;That's more of a risk to markets than the candidates calling each other names.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> looks like he might win, investors will have to figure out how a trade war, or protectionism or anti-immigration policies might impact their investments. Similarly, a Clinton win could give investors pause, as they will likely face higher taxes on investments, as well as get more stringent regulations and oversight of key sectors such as financials and health care, Laperriere adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laperriere says there are two big risks that could cause coming market tumult: &quot;A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> win or a Democratic sweep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If either of those outcomes occur, &quot;you could see investors taking a more conservative approach, or the average businessman saying, 'I am not going to make that marginal investment or job hire because I am not sure what the broader economic environment will look like.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
