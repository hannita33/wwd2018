<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iran has plagued six presidents since revolutionaries overran the U.S. Embassy and took Americans hostage in Tehran in 1979, and it will be one of the hardest diplomatic challenges for the next president as well. The nation is a regional troublemaker, the sworn enemy of U.S. allies Israel and Saudi Arabia, and a key backer of Syria's Bashar Assad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year or even six months ago, there was real fear that Iran's determination to build nuclear weapons would erupt into war. That war didn't happen is a tribute to cooler heads on both sides, and it's the right context for thinking about the entire bumpy road to whatever new relationship the U.S. and Iran are working out. As bad as things are, they could be a lot worse.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's also the appropriate perspective for assessing Iran's recent elections. They didn't change the fundamental nature of the country's leadership or Iran's determination to direct events in its neighborhood.  Hard-liners still control the military, the courts and key sectors of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so -- and this is the good news -- the election was another modest step in the right direction for moderates, who gained scores of new seats in Iran's parliament. Two particularly hard-line members of the Assembly of Experts, the body that will someday pick the next supreme leader, were voted out of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Moderate&quot; is, of course, a relative term in Iranian politics, where many reformers are dead, imprisoned, exiled or simply barred from running for office. Yet these election results are far preferable to ones that could have produced  more hard-line refusal to engage with the West or stick to last year's nuclear agreement, which traded away for at least a decade Iran's plans to build a bomb in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Into this fragile, complicated situation step the two leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination. Ted Cruz vows to &quot;rip&quot; the Iran nuclear accord &quot;to shreds&quot; on his first day in the Oval Office. Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says that if he's president, he'll renegotiate the &quot;insane&quot; bargain that was worked out by &quot;stupid, incompetent&quot; people in the Obama administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cruz's tough talk about tearing up the deal wouldn't just signal that the U.S. can't be trusted to stand by its word from one administration to the next; it ignores the fact that the accord wasn't made only by the U.S. but also by Britain, France, Germany, Russia and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- all of which helped apply the tough sanctions that finally brought Iran to the table. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> blithe claim that he could get a better deal probably either amuses or alarms those other countries, which have said that they won't restart talks if the U.S. unilaterally backs out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For its part, Iran has been as good as its word so far. It shipped 98% of its enriched uranium out of the country, mothballed most of its centrifuges and poured cement into the core of a reactor that could have created bomb-making plutonium. None of this means Iran is turning into a responsible actor on the world stage, but U.S. voters should beware of candidates who'd renege on American commitments and offer simplistic approaches to complex problems. <BR></SPAN></P>
