<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carl Ichan, whose reputation as a successful businessman made him a talking point of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidential bid, is taking a beating in his energy investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares of Oklahoma City-based oil and gas producer Chesapeake Energy Corporation plunged by 50% Monday on rumors that it could seek to file for bankruptcy protection.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chesapeake has since denied the rumors, and the shares closed down $1.02, or 33%, at $2.04 on Monday. Over the last 12 months, Chespeake's shares are down 90% from $20 a share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Icahn's publicly traded investment company, Icahn Enterprises, owns 11% of Chesapeake's outstanding shares, according to regulatory filings. The 80-year-old billionaire, who recently won a bidding war for iconic auto repair company Pep Boys -- Manny, Moe &amp; Jack, didn't immediately return a request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy company stocks are suffering broadly on fears that an economic slowdown in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could spread and reduce demand for oil, natural gas and other fuel sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ichan also owns sizable investments in Cheniere Energy and CVR Energy, according to regulatory filings. Both companies are suffering on concerns of sagging demand, which has pushed oil prices to below $30 a barrel this year, the lowest levels since 2003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares of Cheniere Energy are down 68% over the past 12 months to $23.64 a share. Shares of CVR Energy, meanwhile, are down 31% this year to $28.48.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chesapeake currently has no plans to pursue bankruptcy and is aggressively seeking to maximize value for all shareholders,&quot; the company said in a statement Monday. The rumors started on a report that Chesapeake had started working with restructuring law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday, Chesapeake said Kirkland has served as one of Chesapeake's counsel since 2010 &quot;and continues to advise the company as it seeks to further strengthen its balance sheet following its recent debt exchange.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
