<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> scored the political upset of the century, his critics have worked through four of the five stages of grief at breakneck speed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denial: As  state after state turned orange, media mavens and politicos wondered whether they had gone color blind. Election analysts kept reloading the vote tally from American Samoa trying to convince themselves this can't be happening!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anger: Progressives rampaged through their progressive cities to smash the windows of their progressive neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bargaining:Celebrities shared memes insisting Hillary Clinton  won, linking to stories of the growing popular vote gap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Depression: Colleges hosted cry-ins and communal primal screams. One lost soul wrote an op-ed declaring that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election made her abandon her search for a mate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if you've read your Kubler-Ross, you know the fifth stage has been absent from the collective spleen vent: Acceptance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, every day of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition brings another round of hyperventilation. His detractors were outraged by how long it took </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to make Cabinet nominations, then a few days later switched their outrage to his actual choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were outraged that a tiny meeting of &quot;alt-right&quot; racists praised him. When </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> condemned the wannabe Nazis, the press blamed his supporters for falling for &quot;fake news&quot; and something called &quot;Pizzagate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can you believe what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said to Pakistan's prime minister -- or that he accepted a congratulatory call from Taiwan's president? What will the totalitarians in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> think?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But none of that pearl-clutching compared with the outrage over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweets about flag burning or recounts or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or Hamilton or Saturday Night Live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sad!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's face it: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a, ahem, unique president-elect. Acceptance might come a little slower for those who have grown accustomed to an urbane, smooth-talking Democrat in the West Wing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me offer a little friendly advice: Breathe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look, I was a lifelong Republican until </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won the nomination. I voted third party rather than sign my name to his reactionary agenda. I'm not the combover interloper's biggest fan, to say the least. But hitting the fainting couch every time The Donald acts like he's acted all his life is a recipe for cardiac arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worse still, if you panic over every misspelled tweet or unsourced transition rumor, no one will take you seriously if and when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> really crosses the line. If Democrats learned anything from 2016, it's that they shouldn't have spent the past 50 years calling every Republican a racist, sexist or homophobe. Don't be the boy who cried wolf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's going to be a long four years, with plenty of real decisions to get outraged about. If you keep losing your mind every time Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> acts like Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, you're going to guarantee a long eight years.</SPAN></P>
