<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama gave an optimistic assessment of the campaign against terror on Tuesday, thanking U.S. troops for their help in &quot;breaking the back&quot; of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think Obama had a foreign policy set in place to fight terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did in the U.S., though, which I believe was to promote terror by bringing in a large number of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Davis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama believes that his weak response to terrorism is a solution. All it has done is embolden terrorists, allowing them to grow and undermine the safety of this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lou Creola</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to Obama's strategy, the Islamic State of terrorism is losing, badly, and we're minimizing anything that terrorists could use as tools to recruit more people to their efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terrorists are not emboldened. They would like nothing more than for the West to characterize this as an all-out war on Islam because that would push Muslims into their corner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josh McNeill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we are doing now seems like putting a finger on a leaky pipe. Thus, I don't think we should be the only country fighting terrorism at the level that we are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think we should be generally keeping terrorism out of the U.S. When countries like Russia and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> join us in fighting terrorism with the same intensity the U.S. is, then a more direct approach would be good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce Mort</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the president who said he was going to end all of the wars the U.S. was actively participating in, how can Obama's time in office be seen as anything but a failure?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chad Clausen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All those immigrants entering Europe are a byproduct of terrorism, which was not dealt with under Obama's watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terrorism has, can and will result in a major cultural displacement, which will threaten world order, especially when there is a leadership vacuum abroad.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We asked our followers if they thought President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be able to handle threats to national security effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, because someone who can't handle a tweet doesn't give me confidence he can handle a world crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">@Adampro941</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes! </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is choosing smart, savvy, experienced people for key positions. They will keep us safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">@patrck1950</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can't even handle a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; parody. How the heck is he going to handle national security threats? Scary times!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">@JoelStern7</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, I do and more effectively than now. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won't play games, and those pushing him will soon learn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">@RamonaRedden</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm skeptical, given </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> past performance. He seems too reactionary.</SPAN></P>
