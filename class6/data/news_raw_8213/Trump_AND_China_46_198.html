<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz lobbed their harshest attacks yet at Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, trying to slow the celebrity billionaire's momentum before Super Tuesday's primaries, which could vault him far ahead in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 10th GOP debate at times deteriorated into personal, vindictive bickering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two U.S. senators ganged up on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a slate of topics -- immigration, health care, his family money, his personal finances, and basic fitness for the presidency -- during the CNN event in Houston. It was a change of pace for Rubio, who has generally avoided direct conflict with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and it made this the most contentious debate yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cruz questioned whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is even a Republican, citing his past support for Democratic policy positions and candidates, including Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 2013 when I was leading the fight against the 'Gang of Eight' amnesty bill, where was Donald? He was firing Dennis Rodman on 'Celebrity Apprentice,'&quot; Cruz said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rubio also ridiculed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for claiming he's the one that introduced the topic of immigration reform to the 2016 race, blasting him as &quot;only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired back that he was the only one on stage who had hired anyone, period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two remaining candidates, John Kasich and Ben Carson, fought just to get a word in. Kasich asked the moderators to take control of all the bickering. Carson at one point, begged for speaking time, noting the debate rules that candidates could respond to attacks. &quot;Can somebody attack me, please?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rubio referred to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> now-defunct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University as a &quot;fake&quot; school: &quot;You know what they got? They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; Cruz picked up on this attack and predicted a pending fraud trial brought by students would derail </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggestion to put a high tariff on Chinese exports to the United States, Rubio mocked the businessman: &quot;You are going to be starting a trade war against your own ties and your own suits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case against Rubio and Cruz was that they're both inept politicians, who either melt down under pressure or mislead voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are all talk and no action. This guy's a choke artist,&quot; he said, referring to Rubio, &quot;and this guy's a liar&quot; referring to Cruz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks were an effort to dent the commanding position </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is in after his easy wins in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. The latest delegate count: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 82, Cruz 17, Rubio 16, John Kasich 6 and Ben Carson 4. Next week on Super Tuesday, 595 delegates are up for grabs -- about half of the 1,237 necessary to win the GOP nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer asked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> whether he would release his tax returns as 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney has demanded. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he is routinely audited and &quot;I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously.&quot; Cruz said that underscores the need to see the returns, in case there's fraud. <BR></SPAN></P>
