<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and aides braced for a busy week Sunday by threatening tariffs on companies that move jobs overseas, while downplaying </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protest of an unprecedented phone call between the American president-elect and the leader of Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just days after praising a deal providing tax breaks to a company for keeping jobs in the U.S., </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> renewed his threat to slap tariffs on the products of companies that outsource in the future.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be a tax ... soon&quot; of 35% for companies that go overseas and try to sell goods &quot;back across the border,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said during a Sunday tweet storm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aides, meanwhile, described the president-elect's call on Friday with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen as congratulatory in nature and said it does not signal a change in the &quot;one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; policy toward the government in Beijing, at least not right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think I would just say to our counterparts in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that this was a moment of courtesy,&quot; Vice President-elect Mike Pence told NBC's Meet the Press, noting that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had a similar congratulatory call with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Xi Jinping, and &quot;that was not a discussion about policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which claims Taiwan is a renegade province, protested </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pence also told NBC that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is preparing to take office on Jan. 20, and &quot;we'll deal with policy at that time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In putting together an administration, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is planning more appointments and post-election rallies in the days ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect said last week that, on Monday, he would nominate James Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, for secretary of Defense. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is also weighing a number of candidates for secretary of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his Sunday series of tweets, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said no company should leave the United States because he plans to cut taxes and regulations, and those that do move jobs overseas will face consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U.S. without retribution or consequence, is WRONG!&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tweets came days after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and aides celebrated a deal with the Carrier heat and air conditioning company, which abandoned plans to move some jobs to Mexico after the state of Indiana provided $7 million in tax incentives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even some </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters, such as former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, bashed the Carrier deal as &quot;crony capitalism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, critics are taking aim at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> revival of a threat he made during the presidential campaign, saying his claim to tax products made by U.S. companies overseas will lead to higher prices for American consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pres-Elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> means well,&quot; tweeted Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb. &quot;But won't his 35% tariff idea raise prices on American families? How would it not be a new 35% tax on families?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Edwards, director of tax policy at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, says introducing the 35% tariff &quot;would have all kinds of negative and damaging repercussions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For consumers, it could mean paying more for goods, he said. It could also affect U.S. multinational businesses who seek to broaden their reach globally by exporting goods into other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When, for example, Dupont or GE or other American firms set up facilities in Europe or Latin America or wherever, the main purpose is to penetrate those markets and to expand their global sales&quot; which boosts U.S. exports, Edwards says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his Sunday tweets, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said his 35% tax &quot;will make leaving (the U.S.) financially difficult.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeared to be provoked by news that Rexnord, the Indiana-based bearing manufacturer, is planning to move jobs to Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweeted over the weekend. &quot;This is happening all over our country. No more!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Taiwan phone call also triggered a flap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No U.S. president has spoken officially with a leader of Taiwan since the United States recognized mainland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the sole government of the Chinese people in 1979. Under the &quot;one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; policy, the U.S. acknowledges the Beijing government's claim that Taiwan is part of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hitting the Sunday show circuit, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials said the reaction to the Sunday phone call is overblown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was just a phone call at this point,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> adviser Kellyanne Conway said on Fox News Sunday, and &quot;people shouldn't read too much into it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its statement on the call, Taiwan said the two leaders &quot;exchanged pleasantries and shared their views and principles regarding key policy matters, particularly the need to promote domestic economic development and strengthen national defense so that citizens can enjoy better lives and increased security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Friday conversation with the Taiwanese president was the latest in a series of phone calls between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and foreign leaders that have raised eyebrows in the diplomatic community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a call with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> offered &quot;to play any role you want me to play to address and find solutions to the country's problems,&quot; according to a readout from Pakistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> endorsed his aggressive war on drugs, one in which more than 2,000 people have been killed by police in what critics describe as vigilante justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its protest to the U.S. government over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> call with the Taiwanese president, Beijing said, &quot;There is only one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the world and Taiwan is an inseparable part of the Chinese territory.&quot; The statement called the one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy &quot; the political foundation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-US relations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State-run media in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took a lower-key approach, with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daily saying there is no need to &quot;over-interpret&quot; the Taiwan phone call, attributing it to the New York businessman's &quot;inexperience in dealing with foreign affairs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
