<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe meets with President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in New York on Thursday, much will be at stake -- for both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abe is likely to try to salvage at least part of a major trade deal, secure a commitment to Japan's continued defense and establish a working relationship with the next U.S. leader who has a history of bashing Japan and campaigned on a platform of &quot;America First.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting will be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first with a foreign leader since his election victory last week. He has yet to announce his foreign policy team, and people overseas -- particularly in Asia, where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has mounted a challenge to U.S. power and influence -- will look for assurances that the United States will remain engaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's still too soon to know what effect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will have on East Asia, or Japan in particular, until we know more about his specific policies and appointments,&quot; said Sean King, an East Asia specialist with the Park Securities consulting firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Abe can underscore our two countries' shared values and stress how the U.S.-Japan alliance helps keep open markets, energy routes and world shipping lanes ... and convey to the president-elect how much we could both lose if things ever went awry,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few countries were as shocked by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election as Japan, a longtime U.S. treaty ally and major trading partner. Abe dispatched a senior adviser to meet with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> representatives Monday and reworked travel plans to meet with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this week on his way to an economic conference in Peru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the fractious campaign, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promised to kill the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal that is key to Abe's economic plans. The pact, known as TPP, excludes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although TPP cannot go into effect without U.S. support, Abe has continued to push for ratification in Japan's parliament, the Diet, and is likely to warn </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that rejecting the trade deal could push U.S. partners in Asia toward a separate trade deal, known as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, that includes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;There's no doubt that there would be a pivot to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership if the TPP doesn't go forward,&quot; Abe told Diet members last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> questioned whether Tokyo pays enough support for the 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan. The Defense Department has sent additional troops and its newest and most advanced aircraft, warships and weaponry to the Asia-Pacific in recent years as part of the Obama administration's &quot;re-balance&quot; to the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tokyo spends about $1.8 billion a year to  defray the costs of U.S. troops based in Japan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said during the campaign that's not enough and suggested he might draw down U.S. forces if Japan doesn't spend more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Asia Foundation, based in Washington, warned in a report this week that drawing down U.S. forces could trigger an arms race in the region and might  prompt Japan and South Korea to build their own nuclear weapons. <BR></SPAN></P>
