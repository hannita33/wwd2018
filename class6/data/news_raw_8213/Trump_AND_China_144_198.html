<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> win was largely expected to lead the Federal Reserve to rethink lifting interest rates next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some speculated that the makeup of the Fed would change under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the aftermath of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory to become the 45th president of the United States, both of those theories are in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some economists and futures markets still expect the Fed to act after stocks rebounded from a stomach-churning overnight sell-off. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics told investors immediately after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won, while global markets and U.S. stock futures were in disarray, that he expected the Fed to hold off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But after markets rallied Wednesday following </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> conciliatory victory speech, &quot;you could see the Fed following through,&quot; he told investors in a conference call. He noted economic growth and inflation are likely to pick up in coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed lifted its benchmark rate in December for the first time in nine years but has held it steady since amid market volatility, the United Kingdom's Brexit vote, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic slowdown and meager U.S. inflation. The Fed signaled in its post-meeting statement last week it's poised to raise its federal funds rate from a historically low 0.4% in December, barring adverse shocks to the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic growth accelerated in the third quarter after a sluggish nine months, job growth has been steady and wage gains picked up in October, auguring more rapid inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist of the Economic Outlook Group, said the Fed will move next month in part to provide space to lower rates again next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday, Fed fund futures gave about 76% odds of a rate increase in December, unchanged from the previous day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other economists said the Fed is likely to take a pass next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's just too much uncertainty out there now,&quot; said economist Gus Faucher of PNC Financial Services Group. <BR></SPAN></P>
