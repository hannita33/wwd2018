<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clock's ticking on Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first 100 days in office, and if the post-election stock market rally is to continue, the nation's 45th president must now make good on promises to enact policies that will make it easier for U.S. companies to profit and prosper and American workers to better share in the prosperity, investors say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has to start delivering,&quot; says Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. &quot;How much time the market will give him amid the high expectations, I don't know.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 6.2% gain in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index from Election Day to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inauguration Friday -- the fourth-best  rally for a president-elect -- was driven largely by speculation about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promise to slash the federal tax rate for U.S. companies and to push for deregulation to boost corporate profitability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> met with top CEOs at the White House, reiterating his &quot;America First&quot;  blueprint and sending a clear message that boosting the U.S. economy is a top priority. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he plans to &quot;cut taxes massively&quot; for corporations and the middle class and pare back business regulations &quot;by 75% and maybe more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when it comes to the stock market, which is moving into more of a &quot;show-me&quot; mode, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promises of things to come carries less weight now. Investors have become more skeptical as to how much of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agenda will come to fruition. Those concerns are reflected in the stalling out of the &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally.&quot; The S&amp;P 500 has slipped roughly 1% since its Jan. 6 record close and has posted losses the past two weeks. The index was down 0.4% Monday despite </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> latest promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The market got ahead of itself with all the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> euphoria,&quot; says Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer at First America Trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Wall Street wants to see details about how big a tax cut corporations will actually get. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Monday he sees the corporate tax rate, now 35%, falling to 15% to 20%, which is lower than a plan laid out by fellow Republicans. Investors want to know how big an infrastructure bill </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can get passed and how quickly. Wall Street also wants more details on what types of changes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is seeking from his plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says has resulted in U.S. jobs fleeing to Mexico and Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A big question is whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> main focus is what Wall Street perceives as his more market-friendly plans, such as lowering taxes, bolstering fiscal spending and paring back regulations on businesses while keeping consumer protections in place, says Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Or the more bearish </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policies, such as imposing border taxes on imports to the U.S., and other moves perceived as anti-free trade, such as branding </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a &quot;currency manipulator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they get tax reform, fiscal spending and repatriation of foreign profits done, it will be good for the market,&quot; Arone says. &quot;But if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ... labels </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a currency manipulator, or talks about trade restrictions and tariffs that could prove problematic for the U.S. and the global economy, that would give me pause.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
