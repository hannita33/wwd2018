<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential election is eight months away, but &quot;political risk&quot; is already being felt on Wall Street as money and politics collide in a flurry of often &quot;polarizing and populist&quot; campaign sound bites that investors fear could weigh on the economy, financial markets and global trade.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is political risk on the rise? Yes,&quot; says Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott: &quot;The polarizing, populist rhetoric pointing at select industries, trade and tax policy is an influencing factor in the market's volatility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wall Street loves certainty. But the 2016 race for the White House is all about uncertainty with no shortage of unknowns and potential plot twists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, handicapping this year's circus-like presidential race and its impact on markets has become increasingly difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One wild card is Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the real estate investor best known for his stint on the reality TV show The Apprentice, who has climbed to the top spot in the Republican race despite wobbly support from his own party and withering criticism Thursday from 2012 GOP candidate Mitt Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rise &quot;magnifies the uncertainty,&quot; Luschini says, due in large part to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> anti-establishment, unpredictable, &quot;unconventional ... and unscripted&quot; campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plan to lower tax rates for individuals, investors and corporations is viewed as growth-friendly, many of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> other campaign comments are &quot;protectionist&quot; in nature, which worries free-trade advocates, Wall Street pros say. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says he will build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico to impede illegal immigration. He branded </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a &quot;currency manipulator.&quot; And he's issued unkind words about U.S. companies that set up shop overseas to reduce their tax bills or gain other competitive advantages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's perceived as a populist and nationalist who will reverse the course of globalization,&quot; says Nick Sargen, senior investment adviser at Fort Washington Investment Advisors. &quot;The possibility of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency could cause a stir abroad and possible selling of U.S. securities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rhetoric could also cause a &quot;trade war,&quot; says Axel Merk of the Merk Funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic front-runner and establishment candidate Hillary Clinton also gives some Wall Streeters pause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton has been a vocal critic of the pharmaceutical industry for charging exorbitant prices for prescription drugs, raising fears of drug-price controls. The former first lady and secretary of State is also a proponent of making the banking sector less risky and has proposed levying a &quot;risk fee&quot; on banks, imposing a tax on high-frequency trading firms and holding financial employees and executives accountable when they break the law, according to her campaign website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton, however, is less of a wild card than Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders, says Michael Farr, president of money-management firm Farr, Miller &amp; Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although Hillary is not generally embraced by Wall Street, she is a known quantity,&quot; Farr says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's presidential campaign is a choice between &quot;establishment&quot; candidates and &quot;anti-establishment&quot; hopefuls, says Erik Davidson, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Private Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The establishment candidates represent some level of certainty,&quot; he says. &quot;At least you know what you will be getting.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
