<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today is two months until the presidential election. Do you know where your candidate's tax returns are?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the candidate is Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the answer is no. He steadfastly refuses to do what every major party candidate has done in the past nine elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there is no law requiring candidates to disclose their taxes, presidential contenders of both parties have understood that it is necessary to show that they have nothing to hide and are free of financial conflicts of interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitt Romney released his returns in 2012, even though they exposed his foreign bank accounts and relatively low tax rate. Hillary Clinton released her returns this year, even though they disclosed the unseemly specter of her husband making millions of dollars from a for-profit university. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, plans to release his own returns soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> claims that he should be the exception. The Republican nominee continues to insist, most recently in a Labor Day interview with ABC News, that he really, really wants to release his taxes but can't because he is being audited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is totally bogus. Audits are in no way affected by an individual's decision to release his or her returns. They do not come with gag orders from the IRS and are not prejudiced in any way by publicity. The decision to release or not release is purely at the discretion of the person being audited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision not to come clean inevitably raises questions about what he might be concealing. Without his tax returns, voters will have no way of knowing basic facts: how much money he makes, how much he pays in taxes, and how much he gives to charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For someone who has never held public office and whose main qualification is his success as a businessman, these are important questions. The returns would also shed light on whether he got rich mainly by enriching others, or by manipulating the bankruptcy code and aggressively avoiding taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> personal finances is the issue of what shady behavior might lurk in his far-flung business empire -- such as an improper $25,000 contribution from his family foundation to the attorney general of Florida, whose office was poking around at allegations of fraud at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also has had to turn to some rather unconventional funding sources, including the Bank of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the wake of his six corporate bankruptcies. It's a good bet that tax returns would have more to say on these topics, and perhaps others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asserts that his financial disclosure report provides sufficient clarity. But these forms were devised by Congress to satisfy the public's interest in transparency without requiring much specificity from the candidate. By </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> own admission, his tax returns in most years are far thicker than his 100-page disclosure report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters have every right to know more about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> finances. They haven't gotten anything close to what they deserve. <BR></SPAN></P>
