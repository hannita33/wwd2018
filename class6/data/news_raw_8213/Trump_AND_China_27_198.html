<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While attacking Hillary Clinton and other career politicians, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took aim Tuesday at two other prominent election targets: globalization and free trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very, very wealthy ... but it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said during a speech targeting free trade in a nearly shuttered former steel town in Pennsylvania.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech devoted to what he called &quot;How to Make America Wealthy Again,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> offered a series of familiar plans designed to deal with what he called &quot;failed trade policies&quot; -- including rejection of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with Pacific Rim nations and renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico, withdrawing from it if necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presumptive Republican presidential nominee also said he would pursue bilateral trade agreements rather than multinational deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans also would target one specific economic competitor: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He vowed to label </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a currency manipulator, bring it before the World Trade Organization and consider slapping tariffs on Chinese imports coming into the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton and other politicians, meanwhile, &quot;watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were plunged into depression-level unemployment,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in a dusty old aluminum plant in Monessen, part of what was once known as &quot;The Steel Valley&quot; along the Monongahela River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echoing his mantra of &quot;America First,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vowed to use only American steel -- and aluminum -- on U.S. road, bridge, and construction projects, employing only American workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attacked Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, for past support of trade deals, including TPP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton says she now opposes the Pacific Rim trade agreement and other &quot;bad trade deals&quot; that are hurting U.S. workers. Pledging to appoint a &quot;trade prosecutor&quot; during a speech in Ohio this week, Clinton vowed to go after &quot;unfair trade practices like when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dumps cheap steel in our markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A prominent Clinton supporter -- Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio -- called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a hypocrite, saying he has benefited from trade deals that have helped him sponsor clothing lines made in other countries.  Brown said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has &quot;high-priced accountants&quot; who are &quot;cashing checks from products that he's had manufactured in other countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his speech in a warehouse stacked with  aluminum parts, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Clinton came out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership only &quot;when she saw my stance,&quot; and predicted that she would still sign the trade pact if elected to office. &quot;Her whole career, she has betrayed the American worker,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tends to ignore the benefits of a globalized economy, including easier and increased movement of goods and services across borders that leads to greater selection and cheaper prices for consumers.</SPAN></P>
