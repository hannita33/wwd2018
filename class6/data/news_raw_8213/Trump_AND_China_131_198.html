<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chevrolet Bolt EV, Tesla Model 3 and electric vehicles in general face a radically new regulatory and political playing field as a professed climate change skeptic prepares to occupy the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The budding </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration so far has been short on policy specifics. But just two days after the election, automakers' chief lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, urged the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team to revise not only the fuel economy standards, but also the Obama administration's autonomous vehicle standards, on the grounds that they could cost its member companies billions of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The short answer is that we don't know what will happen with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration and electric vehicles,&quot; said Dave Reichmuth, senior engineer for the Union of Concerned Scientists clean vehicles program. &quot;It might be awhile before we understand the policy priorities for the new administration.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reichmuth points out that the EV tax credit is embedded in the larger federal tax code, so removing it would require action from Congress. So it's not likely to be changed soon, even if that was the direction that was chosen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's worth noting that many of the cars receiving the credit come from U.S. assembly lines -- Tesla in Fremont, Calif., the Volt and Bolt in the Detroit area  and the Nissan Leaf in Smyrna, Tenn. None of this will shake automakers' resolve to advertise and sell these plug-in vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bolt EV comes off a week when it won two Car of the Year awards, one from Motor Trend, the second from Green Car Journal. Its certified 238-mile range on a full charge should ease consumers' anxiety about being stranded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bolt comes to market, beginning in California, at least one year ahead of the Tesla Model 3. Both are in the same price range -- about $30,000 or slightly less after the $7,500 federal tax credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have six now, and four are already sold. Mid-December is the target week for when we get any more,&quot; said Brian Satterlund, new car sales manager at Ron Tonkin Chevrolet in Portland, Ore., which has more public charging stations per capita than any U.S. city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 1,100 miles south in Redwood City, Calif., about 40 customers have preordered Bolts, according to Michael Little, a sales consultant at Boardwalk Chevrolet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those people have paid a $1,000 deposit that holds your place in line,&quot; Little said. &quot;We're expecting to receive 39 Bolts the week of Nov. 28 and another 14 on Dec. 12.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the turmoil in Washington, D.C., the West Coast remains a strong market for EVs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California alone accounted for 54.5%, or 62,119, of the plug-in electric vehicles sold in 2015, according to hybridcars.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's largest state also has its own EV tax credits -- $2,500 for battery electrics and $1,500 for plug-in hybrids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Sperling, founding director of the University of California-Davis Institute for Transportation Studies, said the industry's letter to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team should not be interpreted as a plea to drop emission or fuel economy standards altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are global companies, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Europe are moving forward with their incentives for non-gas-burning vehicles. Whatever the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration does, the rest of the world won't abandon the Paris Agreement to reduce the global growth of carbon emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The industry has made a massive investment in electric vehicles,&quot; Sperling said. &quot;While some would prefer to slow it down, most companies are going to continue along that path.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
