<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Mattis, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nominee to head the Pentagon, testified Thursday that he supports efforts to engage with Russia but doubted the two countries would find ways to cooperate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have very modest expectations about areas of cooperation with Mr. (Vladimir) Putin,&quot; Mattis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has spoken somewhat admiringly of the Russian leader and suggested the two countries could cooperate in fighting the Islamic State.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mattis faced mostly polite questioning during a confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, suggesting his nomination will not face serious opposition in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic leaders expressed hope that Mattis, a blunt-talking retired Marine four-star general, would be a moderating influence on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whose controversial statements and tweets have fueled concerns about his character.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You will help oversee national security policy for a president who lacks foreign policy and defense experience and whose temperament is far different from prior presidents,&quot; Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., told Mattis. &quot;Many Americans, and many in this body on both sides of the aisle, are rightly concerned about how he may respond when he is tested by Russia, Iran, North Korea and other transnational threats such as cyber.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mattis, a combat leader with more than four decades of uniformed service, is a departure from most recent Defense secretaries, who came from the ranks of civilian government service or politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican-led Senate passed a waiver 81-17 Thursday to allow Mattis to run the Pentagon, since federal law requires a seven-year gap between retirement from the military and assuming the Cabinet post. The statute was designed to safeguard the principle of civilian control over the military. The last retired general to head the Defense Department was George Marshall in 1950.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House Armed Services Committee also backed the waiver in a 34-28 vote. The full House is to vote Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mattis described growing global threats and said the U.S. armed forces must remain the best led and &quot;most lethal&quot; in the world, admitting the nation has &quot;shrunk our military capability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mattis said there are &quot;an increasing number of areas where we will have to confront Russia,&quot; adding that Putin is &quot;trying to break&quot; NATO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mattis said if he is confirmed he would meet with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration's new security team to craft a strategy to confront Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More broadly, threats from Russia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and global terrorism represent the biggest threat to world order since World War II, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mattis faced questions from lawmakers about the integration of women into the infantry and other &quot;combat arms&quot; jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women have served extensively in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, but until recently, they have been barred from some &quot;combat arms&quot; jobs, such as the infantry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Obama administration, Defense Secretary Ash Carter ordered that all jobs, including the infantry, be open to women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., cited speeches Mattis made expressing concerns about allowing women into the infantry, a physically demanding job that requires living for long periods of time under primitive conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mattis said he was coming into the job without preconceived ideas. &quot;I have no plan to oppose women in any aspect of our military,&quot; Mattis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his chief concern was military readiness and the &quot;lethality&quot; of the force, which could suggest he might review some aspects of the policy if it could be shown that it hurt capabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Marine Corps asked in 2015 for an exemption for its infantry units after a study that showed mixed-gender infantry squads were not as combat-effective as all-male units. Carter denied the exemption request, and the Marine Corps is taking steps to open the infantry to women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mattis is revered inside the Marine Corps, where his aggressive style and frank conversation  were prized by young Marines. He commanded troops in Afghanistan in 2001 and  Iraq in 2003 and 2004. He served as an infantry battalion commander during the  Gulf War in 1990-91. He headed U.S. Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East, and  met frequently with leaders throughout the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mattis retired in 2013, amid reports the White House squeezed him out. <BR></SPAN></P>
