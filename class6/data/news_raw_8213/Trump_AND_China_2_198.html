<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How did </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> become the second-largest economy in the world and so intertwined with the U.S.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: With a population of nearly 1.4 billion, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the world's largest country. It has taken advantage of its bountiful labor force to fuel an export-oriented economy. In short, it became richer by transforming itself into the world's factory. American companies fully exploited the opportunities, rushing to outsource manufacturing there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result was a burgeoning middle class in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that formed a new export market for American products. More Chinese students can now afford to study in the U.S., often forming the largest international student group at prestigious universities. Chinese tourists pack American hotels in major cities. And the Chinese government began investing heavily in U.S. Treasuries. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is now America's largest debtor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What is a trade deficit, and why has our trade deficit with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> widened?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: A trade deficit occurs when a country's imports of goods and services exceed its exports, or goods and services shipped abroad. The U.S. trade deficit across the globe totaled $531.5 billion in 2015, up from $508.3 billion a year earlier. In other words, Americans consume more foreign goods and services than the country ships overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vast majority of the U.S. deficit derives from trade with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The gap with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rose to $365.7 billion in 2015 from $343.1 billion a year earlier. That's because more U.S. companies continue to outsource to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to take advantage of cheap labor, and those goods are then shipped to the U.S. Meanwhile, U.S. exports to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are growing as wages in that country increase and residents consume more, but not nearly as quickly as imports. The standard of living in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is still relatively low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> puts high tariffs on many American products while U.S. tariffs on Chinese products are low. And the dollar is strong, particularly in relation to the Chinese yuan. That makes U.S. goods more expensive for Chinese customers, and Chinese goods cheaper for Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What U.S. goods are exported to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and which Chinese goods are imported to the U.S.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Some of the goods exported by the U.S. include industrial supplies, foods, airplanes, and car parts and machinery. Goods imported to the U.S. from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> include consumer electronics and clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Why has </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> such a big issue?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Politics plays a huge role.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  knew that the message of bringing jobs back from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would resonate with voters in Rust Belt states.  &quot;There's certainly a sense in heartland America that trade has not worked well for average workers, especially in the manufacturing sector,&quot; says Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University. &quot;It's a lot easier to blame the external boogeyman as the main culprit for the job losses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What does </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> want from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: As seen in his recent negotiations with Carrier to keep operations in the U.S., </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has shown that the appearance of victory matters to him. So he's looking for concessions, says Mauro Guillen, an economics professor at the University of Pennsylvania. &quot;What he wants is to score some kind of victory, at least symbolic,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He may also have more substantive goals in mind, says Matthew Kahn, an economics professor at the University of Southern California. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could negotiate to broaden local market access for American companies, restrict its theft of U.S. intellectual property and continue Chinese investment in U.S. real estate and universities. &quot;I think he wants </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to consume more of our exports,&quot; Kahn says. &quot;He wants more American success there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been accused of currency manipulation. Does this continue? How does it affect our trade policy and American companies' operations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pegs the yuan to the dollar, giving the government much control over its value. Most advanced economies let  currencies &quot;float,&quot; allowing market forces to dictate their currency value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has deliberately devalued its currency, which made its exports cheaper. But the practice has faded in the past two years, Prasad says. With the Chinese economy cooling, market forces have driven the yuan to an eight-year low against the dollar in November. And </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> central bank and other state-owned banks have been intervening to ensure it's not depreciating too far, Prasad says. &quot;Right now, it's doing the reverse of currency manipulating,&quot; he says. &quot;It's helping the U.S.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How does the trade deficit with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> affect the U.S. economy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Consumer goods have gotten cheaper because companies can make them at low cost in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there's no denying that American manufacturing jobs have been lost due to offshoring. Free trade &quot;may come at the expense of some jobs in the U.S. But Americans have developed a taste for cheap consumer goods,&quot; Guillen says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has threatened to slap Chinese imports to the U.S. with 45% tariffs. Would that be effective in narrowing the trade deficit and bringing jobs back to the U.S.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Unlikely, economists say. Any measures to lower imports of Chinese products -- say, a tariff on a specific industry -- will likely result in a tit-for-tat response from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, resulting in higher prices for U.S. exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many U.S. manufacturers then will simply move operations to other countries with low costs, such as Vietnam. Raising tariffs is not a guaranteed remedy for regenerating U.S. manufacturing jobs, Prasad says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides imposing tariffs on American goods, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could seek to make accessing the Chinese market difficult for American companies. That could mean unforeseen licensing requirements and administrative procedures. Chinese students could be held back from attending American universities. Airbus' planes could be favored over Boeing. Intellectual property laws may not be enforced as aggressively. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;can start to restrict its market even more,&quot; Prasad says. &quot;There's a lot they can do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, higher prices on Chinese imports to the U.S. will affect working-class Americans more disproportionately, possibly leading to concerns about inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: What is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> endgame?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Despite </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweets that were antagonistic toward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, few economists expect him to risk a full trade war. But if he followed through on some campaign promises -- such as tariffs or formally declaring </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a currency manipulator -- &quot;that'd signal an opening salvo,&quot; Prasad says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists say </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may be approaching the issue as a business dealer, bluffing and stretching boundaries to extract better deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the United States' need for access to the Chinese market isn't waning, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must tread carefully in his dealings, they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economy is slowing down. Why is this worrisome to Americans?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: The Chinese economy continues to grow, just not at the rate it  did a few years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A slowing Chinese economy would mean less global demand for oil, steel, food and other commodities as well as fewer purchases of American real estate and luxury goods, and perhaps even a slowdown in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> purchase of U.S. Treasuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: How is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trying to spark faster economic growth?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Facing more competition from countries with low-cost labor, such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, the Chinese government has started to shift from an export-driven economy to one fueled by domestic consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the initiative has been slow to take effect as the Chinese are known to be aggressive savers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They don't have Medicare or Social Security,&quot; Guillen says. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has 400 million people still living in poverty in rural areas. They're not ready to move toward a consumer-oriented economy.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
