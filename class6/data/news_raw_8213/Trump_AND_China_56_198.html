<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angst over trade is rusting the lock Democrats have enjoyed on the industrial Midwest in recent presidential elections, turning the region into perhaps the central battleground in the contest between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From eastern Iowa to western Pennsylvania, the Rust Belt  has proven widely and unexpectedly receptive to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> candidacy and may represent his only viable pathway to victory, party leaders, operatives and observers said in interviews at both party conventions over the past week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recognizing this, both campaigns are building infrastructure in the states and formulating key decisions based on how they'll play with Midwestern voters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we don't have a change of the map from Pennsylvania through Iowa, then we're not going to win this election,&quot; two-time Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum told Iowa's convention delegation in Cleveland last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President  Obama carried Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and their collective 70 electoral votes in 2012. Should that Democratic firewall erode and some or all of those states flip to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it could represent the most significant electoral swing of any region in the country: If all five went for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while the rest of the electoral map remained unchanged from 2012, he would win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And polling from across the region suggests </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is competitive. Clinton holds leads in all five of those states, according to polling averages compiled by Real Clear Politics, but with margins of less than 6 percentage points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iowa is the closest, with averages showing a 0.5 percentage-point advantage for Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You go right across -- Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa are all places where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is at or ahead of Romney's numbers,&quot; political statistician Nate Silver  told The Des Moines Register in Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iowa, a perennial presidential swing state, sits on the far western border of the industrial crescent surrounding the Great Lakes, but appears to be among the most competitive and will be a frequent stop for both candidates in the weeks to come -- including on Thursday, when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> makes his first visit to the state since the Feb. 1 caucuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is the Midwest looking so close?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider the views of Jesse Gonzales. The 26-year-old from Lakewood, Ohio, was a magnet for  reporters on the first day of the Republican National Convention last week when he went strolling through a downtown Cleveland plaza wearing a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign hat and an AK-47 rifle strapped to his back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the most critical political issue he saw -- besides maintaining rights of gun owners -- was a lack of economic opportunity. And he blamed trade policy for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is not being protectionist enough,&quot; Gonzales said. &quot;It's the government's job to ensure that our economy is functional and they failed to do so. They've made sure that other country's economies flourish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Dennis Kucinich, a former congressman from Cleveland and Democratic candidate for president, pointed to global trade and free-trade agreements as the primary factor putting the Rust Belt in play this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trade has stripped this area not just of the financial power of major industries but also thousands of small manufacturing and companies&quot; he said. &quot;NAFTA, the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership all are part of a disaffection that working people have with both political parties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kucinich, known as a liberal during his time in office, said he was not comfortable with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> political style but credited him with recognizing the political potency of trade and addressing the issue more clearly than any  candidate in the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton has taken a more nuanced approach on the trade issue. As first lady, a U.S. senator and secretary of State, she took a range of positions on various trade deals, and since becoming a presidential candidate she has suggested changes are necessary to the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership. Her chief Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders, ran heavily on opposition to free trade during his challenge to Clinton -- leading </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to explicitly court Sanders voters in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals &amp; global special interests, we welcome you with open arms. People first,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweeted on July 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Santorum, who represented western Pennsylvania in Congress before going to the Senate, recalled attending a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> event in the traditionally Democratic town of Monessen, Pa., last month and encountering several onetime Democrats now supporting the GOP nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is able to get voters who feel disenchanted from Democrats because Hillary Clinton is a Wall Street globalist,&quot; Santorum said. &quot;She is a not a blue-collar, working person's candidate, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans in Cleveland contended that vice presidential nominee Mike Pence's addition to the ticket would further boost </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chances in the region, as the Indiana governor reflects Midwestern values and quells doubts about the nominee's inconsistent record and bombastic rhetoric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a conservative, Midwestern governor who's had a good track record of bringing jobs to Indiana,&quot; Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said. &quot;He's stable, reliable and he's both a social and economic conservative. I think he reassures people who may have had some misgivings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton, in turn, is taking no chances in Iowa and across the region. After the convention, she'll travel across Pennsylvania and into Ohio for her first campaign swing as the party nominee.</SPAN></P>
