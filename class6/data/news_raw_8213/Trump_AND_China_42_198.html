<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most critical foreign policy challenges President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will face in the early days of his administration is what to do about the nuclear saber rattling that continues to emanate from North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ringing in 2017 with a New Year's Day address, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told the world that the year ahead would see North Korea test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), perhaps one capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because North Korea denies most information to the outside world, no one knows for sure whether Kim's claim is true or whether North Korea possesses the technological know-how to launch a missile on a suborbital trajectory and have it return to Earth on target. Last year, it tested its intermediate-range missile and failed seven of eight times.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has signaled that he has a plan, but it remains under wraps. He did tweet that &quot;North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Basics of deterrence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether successful or not, an ICBM test by North Korea would be very much against U.S. interests. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should act to counter it as early as possible. A turn to the basics of deterrence would be the path most likely to succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For deterrence to be effective, America should make clear to North Korea and its 33-year-old autocratic leader that an ICBM test will neither empower the Kim regime nor advance its nuclear capability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When North Korea threatened ICBM development in 2006, former Defense secretary William Perry and Ashton Carter, who now holds the job, recommended that the United States destroy any test missile on its launch pad. That plan, however, was considered too escalatory and raised fears that North Korea might respond by firing artillery at U.S. allies in the region, such as South Korea or Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could announce a plan to use U.S. missile defenses to shoot down any test ICBM after its launch. Shooting down North Korea's test vehicle would be a spectacular demonstration of the futility of the Kim regime continuing to pursue its nuclear ambitions, and far less escalatory than dropping bombs on North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration could threaten to undermine the Kim regime's power through new information operations if North Korea tests an ICBM. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also could pressure </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to intervene, though Presidents Obama and George W. Bush had similar hopes and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> never delivered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tweeting at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made clear his dissatisfaction with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> failure to intervene in a recent tweet: &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been taking out massive amounts of money and wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!&quot; But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might be more willing to intercede if it knows that the United States is prepared to take major action against the Kim regime to stop its testing of ICBMs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim has parallel goals in pursuing nuclear weapons: One is to distract his people from the many economic and social failures of the Kim family regime by showing the world that North Korea is a nuclear peer of the United States. The other is to demonstrate his ability to strike the USA with nuclear weapons. He hopes to thereby coerce U.S. agreement to a peace treaty with North Korea to end the 1950s Korean War, which could lead to an eventual withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea. Without U.S. forces in South Korea, Kim might be emboldened to pursue the only form of reunification he supports -- North Korean conquest and absorption of South Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though a test is merely a test, if Kim orders enough of them during 2017, North Korea could succeed in resolving the many problems its missile program has encountered. That's why a strong U.S. response is needed now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There clearly are risks to any response that could provoke the mercurial Kim, but the risks of allowing North Korea to have a proven ICBM capable of carrying a nuclear payload are far greater. If even a single nuclear-armed North Korean ICBM were to strike a U.S. city, it could kill or seriously injure several hundred thousand Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should be clear on how he would respond, not just to the threat of attack, but also to the tests that could make such an attack possible in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kim should know that testing ICBMs will bring no benefits but will instead extract costs.</SPAN></P>
