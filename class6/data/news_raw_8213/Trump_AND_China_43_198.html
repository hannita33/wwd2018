<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one has made more bonehead statements in this presidential run than Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Pundits sometimes attribute this to inexperience. They're wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been crafting his campaign since at least 1980, when Rona Barrett asked him whether he'd ever seek the nation's top job. Why would a gossip columnist pose such a question? Maybe </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> planted the idea?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1988, he assured Oprah Winfrey that if he ever sought the presidency, he'd probably win. Then in 1999, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> formed a presidential exploratory committee on the Reform ticket. His first primary would be in California, where he made his pitch on Jay Leno's Tonight Show.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a producer for the show, I booked and worked directly on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appearances, and I'll never forget that one. Leno introduced </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as &quot;the next president of the United States,&quot; and he walked out to the strains of Hail to the Chief while flashing victory signs. Leno was going for a joke. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was serious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real estate mogul went on to win the Golden State Reform Party primary in 2000, but soon dropped out of the race when it became apparent he had no chance of winning the presidency. He has never liked losing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dry runs on TV</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would return to The Tonight Show in 2004, ostensibly to plug his new NBC show, The Apprentice. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> went out of his way to push his political views. And it didn't stop there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During subsequent bookings on both NBC with Leno and CBS with David Letterman, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hinted at his interest in a presidential bid. I thought  he was doing it as a ruse to promote The Apprentice and later Celebrity Apprentice; I chalked it up to  unconventional but effective marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now that he is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, I realize I had it backward: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wasn't posing as a presidential candidate to boost his Nielsen ratings. He was actually making a campaign dry run under the guise of being a celebrity. I've reviewed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interviews with Leno and Letterman over the years, and discovered he had regular talking points:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OPEC is ripping off our country with high gas prices despite huge oil reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is doing a number on us with unfair trade practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're spending billions to build the infrastructure of Iraq but nothing to rebuild our cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to bring back jobs to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sound familiar? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been honing his campaign shtick for more than 30 years, like a comedian testing material to come up with a killer set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he has made clear he sees late-night shows as integral to a campaign -- for instance, comparing Mitt Romney unfavorably to President Obama in 2012 because &quot;Obama, say what you want, he was on Jay Leno, he was on David Letterman. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a monster, as his critics contend? I don't think so. Now, I don't claim to be an insider. But I had a 10-year relationship with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and my phone calls were always returned, sometimes by him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Backstage at The Tonight Show, he was always pleasant and never asked for special treatment. His wife, Melania, and his adult children were equally gracious. People who worked for him, including women, were loyal and supportive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capable of change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is he racist? In my experience, no. I've read his books, The Art of the Deal and The Art of the Comeback, and I think they reflect his business philosophy: Make outrageous demands, and then back off and negotiate a deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does he have flaws? Yes, he has a bad case of inflated self-esteem, which severely clouds his vision. Just before a scheduled chat with Leno in September 2005, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> greeted me by saying, &quot;I'm here to save your sorry network.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he pointed out that The Apprentice was rated No. 1. Except it wasn't. The ratings had started to slip at the time. I thought he was joking, so I laughed. But he didn't, and neither did his staffers. It was obvious that they hadn't told him about his dropping Nielsen numbers. You can't be president if you only hire yes-people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> biggest problem? A tendency to be small and petty. He loved gossiping about people like Rosie O'Donnell with Leno and other hosts. This is a serious character flaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> capable of changing? I think so. He took direction from executives at The Apprentice by adding famous people and renaming it Celebrity Apprentice, averting a possible cancellation. Recently, he has used teleprompters to make major campaign speeches and toned down at least some of his bonehead remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's huuuuuge.</SPAN></P>
