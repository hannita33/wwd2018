<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With just weeks left until Election Day, Kevin Doane remains undecided. Mostly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll be honest with you. When it comes time, I probably won't know until the end,&quot; said the 63-year-old owner of a title company in this small Rust Belt city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doane grew up a Democrat but became a reliably Republican voter. This year, that streak may end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know one thing: I won't vote for Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; he said. &quot;Absolutely not.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what passes for certainty in Clark County, where Springfield is the county seat and largest town. It's a swing county in the quintessential swing state. In 2012, Clark County supported GOP candidate Mitt Romney, but by only 523 votes out of 64,301 cast for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its purple-county status isn't the only reason Clark County matters this year, either. For </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to win the election, he must steal away blue-collar Democrats from Hillary Clinton -- people who, like Clark County's residents, generally are whiter, poorer and less educated than Ohio as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio has a larger share of white residents without college degrees than nearly any other swing state. That's why it has remained close or leaned a few points toward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while Clinton pulls ahead in other states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Clark County, it's clear not all of these blue-collar voters are sold on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. His protectionist promises and rhetoric about job-stealing immigrants resonate with some of the county's fence-sitters. But many others are turned off by his inability to campaign with discipline and stay on point on the topics they care about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And despite what the stats -- and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- may say, others just don't feel the desperation he describes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even five years ago, beleaguered Clark County might have been more interested in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> message, said Michael McDorman, president of the Greater Springfield Chamber of Commerce and a Springfield native with deep family ties to the manufacturing industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now, the county is clawing its way out of its economic hole, diversifying with new service-sector jobs and rejuvenating its downtown. Even manufacturing is hiring again, bringing back blue-collar jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're starting to see a change in Springfield. We're starting to see people believe in themselves again,&quot; he said. &quot;We're starting to see us move forward and take some risk in order to move forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven years ago, Cheri Crothers returned with her husband to Springfield, her childhood home. She found a city transformed, but not for the better. She reels off a list of manufacturers that disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were driving through Springfield, and there was closed-up Robbins &amp; Myers; William Bailey's gone, SPECO's gone,&quot; said Crothers, a Democrat. &quot;A lot of these manufacturers that I remember as a child growing up here, that were so active, were not here anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kyle Koehler owns the tool and die company K.K. Tool Co. in Springfield and represents Clark County as a Republican in the Ohio House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, became law in 1994 and was hailed by both Republicans and Democrats as a tool to eliminate barriers to trade and investment between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Springfield, NAFTA is still a dirty word. While other factors lured away jobs and sometimes shut down entire factories, NAFTA bears some of the blame -- and gets plenty of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before NAFTA, Koehler recalled, you could walk into a home improvement store and pick up steel wool made by International Steel Wool and see &quot;Springfield, Ohio&quot; on the back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of NAFTA, that company packed up, went to Mexico and in a year folded and was gone,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a good, vital company that was in Springfield that provided jobs, and not only was it no longer in Springfield, it no longer existed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company shut down in 2002 and reopened in 2010, but it never returned to Springfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The post-NAFTA job losses felt fatal to an economy centered on manufacturing. In 2000, 30% of the county's gross domestic product, or GDP, came from manufacturing. In 2014, only 17% did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, only two manufacturers -- Navistar and Honda -- break the top 10 private employers in Clark County, a list historically dominated by manufacturing. The county's top private employers are now the local health care system, Community Mercy Health Partners, and a call center for insurance company Assurant Specialty Property, according to the chamber of commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For McDorman, the chamber president, the past 15 years have been the aftermath of job losses that peaked at the turn of the century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We really hit rock bottom in 1999 or 2000,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the aftershocks continued, even as Springfield began to chart a path forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loss of good-paying manufacturing jobs gut-punched the area's middle class. In 2001, only one in five of the county's population earned lower-tier incomes. By 2014, a third of the population did, according to a Pew report this year. Median household income fell more than a quarter in 15 years, to $53,957 in 2014, according to a Pew analysis of U.S. Census data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doane, the title company owner, said he can't bring himself to vote for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but understands why the candidate's message might resonate with some voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's a lot of unhappy people, and they're just really unhappy with the system. And I think they think </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is an answer,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Springfield's economy is changing, and its emerging future bears little resemblance to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> statements about a revival of manufacturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speedway, the convenience store chain, is expanding its headquarters in Clark County, adding 450 jobs. EF Hutton, a financial services provider, opened its doors in late September and plans to hire more than 400. McDorman said a medical supply company is planning to relocate to downtown Springfield with 300-plus jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even manufacturing isn't disappearing entirely. Koehler said his business is expanding and taking back work from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our heart and blood is manufacturing, but with people like EF Hutton coming to town, bringing white collar jobs, professional jobs, that's important,&quot; said Koehler, the state representative. &quot;We've sort of diversified over the years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manufacturing is still a thing. It's just not the only thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lynda Smith, the Republican Party chairwoman for Clark County, says &quot;a lot&quot; of Democrats are asking about switching to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. She doesn't ask questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union workers, who generally vote overwhelmingly Democrat, remain a political force in Clark County. Jason Barlow, president of the United Auto Workers Local 402, which represents local workers at Navistar, said internal polling has shown some GOP union members are considering Clinton, while some Democratic members are considering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. On the whole, he said, the 1,200-member union is likely to break down along party lines as it has in the past. And the 4,300 union retirees might lean more toward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This election here, it's been an anomaly,&quot; he said. &quot;Our membership has had ... interesting debates, let's just say that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shift in Clark County's economy means the blue-collar union bloc may not matter as much as it once did. The largest voting bloc in the county, according to GOP chairwoman Smith, is undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anne Robinette, 50, is a registered Republican. But she's undecided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary has too much baggage following her, and Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is too much of a reality TV show,&quot; said Robinette, a collections manager. .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under a baking sun on a busy Springfield street corner, the Jarrell brothers hold signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brothers look like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters. But looks can be deceiving. Neither plans to vote for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Understand,&quot; Richard Jarrell said, &quot;you've got to play both sides of the fence sometimes.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
