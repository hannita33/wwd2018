<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 2016 Nobel Prize laureate will be announced Friday at 5a.m. ET.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize are kept secret and not revealed by the Norwegian Nobel Committee until 50 years later, organizers do release the number of nominations: 376 this year -- 228 individuals and 148 organizations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone can technically be nominated for the $930,000 accolade, but only a person deemed qualified by the Nobel committee to nominate candidates can do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 2002, the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) has produced a shortlist of candidates that it says merit the distinction. The shortlist is chosen by PRIO Director Kristian Berg Harpviken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday, Harpviken dropped Colombia from his list after voters rejected a peace deal that would have ended 52 years of conflict between the government and rebels. According to Harpviken, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the actress Susan Sarandon have been nominated -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for &quot;his vigorous peace through strength ideology, used as a threat weapon of deterrence against radical Islam, the Islamic State, nuclear Iran and communist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; and Sarandon for &quot;helping refugees in Greece&quot; over Christmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harpviken's 2016 Nobel Peace Prize shortlist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Svetlana Gannushkina (Russia)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gannushkina is the founder of the Civic Assistance Committee, a group that offers legal aid, education and assistance to migrants and refugees. Her work has focused on the human rights of displaced people and different ethnic groups in Russia and former Soviet republics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moniz (USA)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was speculation last year that the prize would go to Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif, Secretary of State John Kerry or the European Union's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, for their work on the Iran nuclear deal. Harpviken said that amid what appears to be easing tensions and renewed diplomatic contacts between Iran and the West, the award should be shared between the energy ministers of Iran and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White  Helmets (Syria)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Composed of regular citizens, the Syrian Civil Defense, or &quot;White Helmets,&quot; is a team of volunteer emergency workers who risk their lives to pull out civilians trapped in the rubble of buildings targeted by bombs in Syria's five-year civil war. The network of about 3,000 volunteers has saved about 60,000 lives, according to the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward  Snowden (USA)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To some, Snowden is a traitor who should be jailed for leaking information about secret U.S. surveillance programs. To others, he is a heroic whistle-blower whose revelations about U.S. snooping led to political and legal changes and who does not deserve exile in Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeanne Nacatche Banyere, Jeannette Kahindo Bindu and Denis Mukwege (Democratic Republic of Congo)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trio are gynecologists who specialize in treating victims of rape and sexual violence. Banyere and Bindu have provided help to survivors of sexual attacks across the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Mukwege set up a hospital dedicated to this work and personally treated thousands of women. <BR></SPAN></P>
