<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is ending his presidential bid the same way he began it: Defiant and provocative, breaking campaign norms and ignoring experts' advice -- and continuing to appeal to a slice of the American electorate ready to disrupt a political system they complain isn't working for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidate himself has no shortage of grievances: Voter fraud he claims will take place in cities such as Chicago and Philadelphia. Polls he disputes that show him trailing Hillary Clinton by growing margins. A news media he labels as corrupt. &quot;The press has created a rigged system and poisoned the mind of so many of our voters,&quot; he said at a campaign rally Tuesday in Colorado Springs, a lead-up to Wednesday's third presidential debate in Las Vegas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the debate opened with a clash over Supreme Court appointments, winning the White House would require the billionaire businessman to stage the most dramatic political comeback in modern American history. Clinton's national lead is the largest any candidate has held in decades three weeks before Election Day. But his new message -- that journalists and the political establishment are working in collusion against him to rig the election -- helps guarantee that his campaign will have a continuing impact even if he loses on Nov. 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some ways, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is like a bull trying to make sure as many teacups as possible are shattered before he leaves the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">china</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, he doesn't seem to be making a concerted effort to reach out to independents and other swing voters by adopting a more presidential mien. House Speaker Paul Ryan and other senior Republicans have had no notable success in urging him to moderate his tone. Especially since the second debate, as he faces allegations of  sexual misconduct from a dozen women, he has been fiercely attacking Clinton's character and repeatedly complaining about a rigged election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That approach is designed to gin up his core supporters and, perhaps, discourage Clinton's supporters from showing up to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also invites ridicule from Democrats. President Obama told him to &quot;stop whining&quot; and dismissed the idea that it would even be possible to rig the election, which depends on  independently run voting systems in each state and the District of Columbia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have never seen in my lifetime, or in modern political history, any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place,&quot; Obama said with apparent astonishment at a White House news conference Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, Clinton has her own problems. She is on the defensive over the WikiLeaks release of thousands of emails that among other things contain purported excerpts from cozy speeches she delivered to Wall Street bankers. An FBI document that was just released suggests that a senior State Department official and an FBI official discussed a quid pro quo aimed at changing the classification of information in an email sent to the private server she used exclusively while secretary of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the campaign's final weeks, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> burn-down-the-house strategy is likely to have an impact that will be felt not only by President Hillary Clinton, if she wins, but also by a divided Republican Party. Regardless of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> own role down the road, if he loses the election, the discontent he has tapped more effectively than any other political figure this year isn't going away after the ballots are counted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has created a roiling force that will make national politics and policymaking an even bumpier ride than it has been in recent years,&quot; predicts Steven Schier, a political scientist at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., and co-author of Polarized: The Rise of Ideology in U.S. Politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> allegations of a fixed election, while not backed up by evidence, could raise questions among some about the legitimacy of Clinton's victory, just as his discredited suggestions that Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States raised questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accusations of criminal misconduct by Clinton, which regularly sparks chants of &quot;Lock Her Up!&quot; at his rallies, could encourage Republicans to demand investigations of the new president. His hard line on immigration and trade could make it more difficult for GOP lawmakers to consider compromises that would help get legislation passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he has affected the political landscape itself. He has blurred the lines between politics and celebrity. He has crossed the traditional boundaries about what is appropriate to say and do in a political campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the second debate, he invited several women who had accused former president Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the third one, he invited Patricia Smith, who blames Clinton for the death of her son during the 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. And, oddly, Malik Obama, the president's half-brother who has endorsed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. <BR></SPAN></P>
