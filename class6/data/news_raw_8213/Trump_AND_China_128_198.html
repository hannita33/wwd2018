<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As anyone who watches reality television knows, the genre might be entertaining, but its correlation to actual reality is tenuous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is a good place to start with the much-awaited foreign policy speech delivered Wednesday in Washington by  candidate Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to burnish his presidential credentials.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with The Apprentice, the show that helped him become a household name, the Republican front-runner sought to provide appealing fare for a certain demographic. In this case, the primary audience was voters opposed to trade, resentful of immigrants, distrustful of foreign governments and wistful for a time when America wielded more power in a simpler world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reaching out to this group, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vividly portrayed a world that does not exist: America's allies would be more respectful after being lectured to, while its enemies would be dealt with by bluster. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would fall into line after enduring unspecified economic pressure. And troubled regions of the world would be stabilized through American disengagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inexplicably, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declared that &quot;America First&quot; would be &quot;the overriding theme&quot; of his administration's foreign policy. A non-interventionist approach might have its merits in certain situations. But the America First movement got its name espousing an isolationist approach at exactly the wrong moment, urging the United States to stay out of World War II as Adolf Hitler was rampaging through Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> secondary audience was the foreign policy elite, the equivalent of TV critics. And the early reviews were harsh. On CNN, foreign policy experts Fareed Zakaria and David Rothkopf used the same word to describe the speech: incoherent. Fellow Republican Lindsey Graham tweeted, &quot;Not sure who is advising </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on foreign policy, but I can understand why he's not revealing their names.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> worldview, things happen because he says they will. He made a number of proclamations to this effect. His unspecified plan to defeat the Islamic State terrorist group echoed Richard Nixon's secret plan in 1968 to win the Vietnam War. ISIL &quot;will be gone if I'm elected president,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vowed, &quot;And they'll be gone quickly. They will be gone very, very quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things might happen that way on TV. But not in reality. Or perhaps we should say real reality. <BR></SPAN></P>
