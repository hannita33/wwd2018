<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Balough lives 2,000 miles from Silicon Valley, but it might as well be on the other side of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have many jobs here,&quot; says Balough, 65, a high school teacher in West Plains, Mo., who voted for President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;We have lumber mills, but a few shoe and clothing factories got shipped out. As far as we're concerned, the two coasts and the Midwest are two different cultures. It's like Europe is different than America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory over Clinton -- an outcome few in the tech industry supported and many failed to believe would happen -- has engendered a mix of shock, anger, grief and denial in Silicon Valley. It's also prompted many to ask: Why and how did the companies that have become the most valuable in the U.S.  lose touch with great pools of their customers?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing seems certain: While many of those voters engaged with this election using the fruits of the tech industry's latest advances, sharing curated news on Facebook, settling arguments via Google and checking notifications on an Apple iPhone, few thought they were enjoying a direct economic benefit from the U.S. tech industry. In some cases, it has hurt them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steel mills &quot;can't keep up with cheap imports&quot; or advances in technology, says Ray Rogg, 54, a steel worker from Erlanger, Ky. &quot;The more automated and technical things are, and with better computers, it eliminates people,&quot; says Rogg, who has worked 26 years at the TMK Ipsco mill in Wilder, Ky. &quot;It winds up streamlining things and taking away jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tech boom may have created vast wealth and a swath of  high-paying jobs  around metro areas such as San Francisco and Seattle, but a nationwide surge in tech jobs has failed to follow. Much of the Rust Belt, South and Midwest are still reeling from the economic dislocations of globalization, the financial crisis and a technology-driven boom in productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Manufacturing jobs in the current economy are going away -- we are moving to a service economy,&quot; says Steve Bennet, an adjunct professor at San Jose State University who specializes in entrepreneurship and venture capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In interviews with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> voters across the nation, they described themselves as working men and women who  want decent-paying jobs, with affordable health care, so they can take care of themselves and their families. Many ultimately overlooked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> off-putting comments because their underlying fear and anxiety about the economy runs deep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deep red, in fact. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> handily beat Hillary Clinton 70%-26% in counties dominated by manufacturing, according to exit polls by Edison Research. He rolled to a 60%-37% advantage in the 121 reporting counties with the highest rates of unemployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silicon Valley's success hasn't translated to jobs, as machines and on-demand work replace low- and middle-income work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employment at computer and electronic companies has plummeted 45% since the 1990s, according to Labor Department statistics. They employed 1.03 million in the U.S. in August, down from 1.87 million in 2001. In the same 15-year period, total employment at semiconductor makers was halved, to 359,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> blue-collar supporters aren't likely to be fans of the 1099 (sharing) economy,&quot; says Rakesh Agrawal, a former PayPal exec who runs freelance-marketplace Redesign Mobile. &quot;They grew up with stable jobs with good work-life balance, cheap health care and employer-paid pensions. That is not today's economy, and that's certainly not the gig economy that Silicon Valley is creating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hardware production has shifted overseas, as exemplified by Apple's large manufacturing facilities in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Ireland and chip maker Micron's massive offshoring of jobs to Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet while the blue-collar voter came out for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that didn't tell the full story: 48% of his voters made $100,000 a year or more and 43% held college degrees, according to exit polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was intrigued by a non-establishment figure, and I agreed with his policies on immigration and health care,&quot; says Mika Pittman, 44, an IT administrator from Princeton, Minn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Automated technology and services have allowed start-ups to keep their workforces austere -- WhatsApp had 55 people when Facebook acquired it for $21.8 billion in 2014. And tech whizzes at Amazon, Tesla Motors and elsewhere have come up with high-end production lines in the U.S. that minimize people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies such as Amazon and Walmart are seen as marginalizing opportunities for small businesses. &quot;Washington ignores small business,&quot; says Maxine Gutman, 56, an insurance attorney in Parkland, Fla. &quot;I support </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for his business background.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The economy was No. 1 for me,&quot; says Randy Herschelman, 58, a technical recruiter in Dallas. &quot;(</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) understands the bottom line and will delegate the right people to execute his agenda. Obamacare and taxation are killing the middle class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology has had as much to do with the jobs drop as pure economics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The future, meanwhile, is expected to bring drones, robots, driverless cars and machine learning that further reduce demand for jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Digital technology is at ground zero of what's happening. It delivers enormous benefits but it also has enormous costs,&quot; says Paul Saffo, a futurist based in Silicon Valley. &quot;The bad news is that technology accelerates the disruption in jobs. The good news is that technology gives people a place to complain about it when they don't have a job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
