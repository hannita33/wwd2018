<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the transition chairman, are taking a &quot;structured&quot; and &quot;methodical&quot; approach to putting together a presidential administration, spokesman Jason Miller said, and &quot;we're not going to rush&quot; the process.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to make sure that they're people that we are confident will pass confirmation and they're going to be people that we think can implement the president-elect's vision,&quot; Miller said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said on social media. &quot;I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a day of meetings at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> heard from one of his critics: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said he had a &quot;candid&quot; meeting with the president-elect about his concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They included proposed tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy, stepped-up deportation plans, support for &quot;stop-and-frisk&quot; police policies and a possible registry of Muslim migrants, said de Blasio, who pledged to be &quot;open-minded&quot; but &quot;vigilant&quot; about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top aides have drifted in and out of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in the week since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election, many of them potential appointees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them: Ex-New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is up for secretary of State; Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a possible attorney general or Defense secretary; retired general Michael Flynn, being discussed for the Pentagon as well as national security adviser; and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, a former Republican primary rival of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who is being talked about for attorney general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cruz declined to address speculation about his future, saying, &quot;I look forward to working very closely with the president-elect, the vice president-elect to repeal Obamacare and to confirm a strong conservative Supreme Court justice to protect the rights of all Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of a tweet storm Wednesday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cited some of the nations whose foreign leaders have spoken with him since the election. His list: Russia, the United Kingdom, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saudi Arabia, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The transition team put out a list of 29 world leaders who have spoken with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or Pence since last week's election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pence spent part of Wednesday in Washington at a lunch with Vice President Biden and their wives. <BR></SPAN></P>
