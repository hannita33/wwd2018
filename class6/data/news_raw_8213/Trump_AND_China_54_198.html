<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pro-U.S. foreign policy of South Korean President Park Geun Hye is at risk now that she appears to be on her way out over a growing corruption scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Park, whose approval ratings are an abysmal 4%, faces possible impeachment by South Korea's legislature  -- if she doesn't resign first -- and massive street protests over the power she is accused of granting to a controversial personal friend, Choi Soon Sil. Prosecutors allege that Choi, the daughter of a deceased cult leader who mentored Park, used her relationship with the president to extort $68 million in corporate donations to foundations Choi controlled and invested the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Park spearheaded several policies with U.S. approval that could be jettisoned along with her:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NORTH KOREA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Park's initial policy toward North Korea was to engage through trust-building measures, but her approach made an abrupt turnaround after the North's nuclear test in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It affected everything with North Korea, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Japan,&quot; said John Delury, who teaches international studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. &quot;Now, with the equally sudden demise of the president, it puts into question the new hard-line policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, Park ordered South Korean companies to pull out of the Kaesong Industrial Complex to protest a North Korean missile launch. The plant, which uses North Korean labor and South Korean management and expertise, was a major source of funds for the North and one of the few remaining avenues for cultural exchange between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If she leaves office, &quot;the liberal opposition would reopen it,&quot; Delury said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Park's new approach was in line with U.S. efforts to isolate North Korea and deprive it of foreign sources of income. President Obama said in September that new and existing sanctions show North Korea there are &quot;consequences to its unlawful and dangerous actions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathleen Stephens, who served as U.S. ambassador to South Korea from 2008 to 2011, said opposition parties are likely to call for more active efforts to re-engage with Pyongyang on a raft of issues and to argue that Park's hard-line policy has not worked. It would be &quot;a major project&quot; to reopen relations with the North, but options would include a resumption of food and humanitarian aid, plus family reunions that took place in past years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chung In Moon, a foreign affairs adviser to South Korea's opposition, called in September  for suspending joint military exercises with the United States and for encouraging dialogue with the North. Such a move by South Korea would be seen as a step toward rejecting the U.S. security umbrella in the region that has existed since the 1950s, said Yun Sun, an analyst at the Stimson Center, a Washington think-tank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MISSILE DEFENSE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test, in September, Park approved the deployment of a U.S. missile-defense system called the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) to protect South Korean cities and 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in her country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed deployment angered </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- South Korea's most important trading partner -- which sees the system as a threat to its aircraft and missile capabilities. The deployment is controversial among South Koreans who question the system's effectiveness, Delury said. &quot;There is evidence already that North Koreans are figuring out a way around it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Korea's liberal opposition party, which seeks better relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in hopes it could temper North Korea, is among the fiercest critics of THAAD. Though the liberals may not cancel the $850 million system financed by the United States, they could probably block its expansion. If President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> follows through on his campaign promise to make U.S. allies pay more for their defense, the THAAD deployment could be scrapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A liberal (South Korean) president could call </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bluff,&quot; Delury said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JAPAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Park's government ordered South Korea's military this year to exchange security information for the first time with Japan, a bitter enemy in past decades. The arrangement was encouraged by Obama and his predecessors who've long sought to reconcile the U.S. allies, so they could cooperate on security and form a unified front against North Korea and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many South Koreans continue to distrust Japan because of its occupation of Korea during the first half of the 20th century, said Jenny Town, assistant director of the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. &quot;South Koreans are always very skeptical of too much military cooperation between South Korea and Japan because of the history between the two countries,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Korea and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> see the arrangement as &quot;the U.S. trying to create collective security,&quot; Town said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRADE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How a post-Park South Korea balances policy toward the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is hard to predict, in part because the United States is going through its own transition, Stephens said. South Korea's trade with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has gotten so big that South Koreans worry about over-dependence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's why the U.S. alliance has come to be more valued,&quot; Stephens said, but Korea has &quot;a huge relationship with Beijing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a candidate, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called the U.S.-Korean Free-Trade Agreement reached in 2012 a &quot;job-killing trade deal.&quot; He threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, which would hurt the economies of all the countries in the region. To save the free-trade agreement, South Koreans would &quot;point out increased trade and services that benefit the U.S.,&quot; Stephens said. &quot;They're watching very closely, wondering what the new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration will do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Korea is also developing an alternative, since it shares a long history with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and trade between the two outweighs trade with the United States and Japan combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many among South Korea's opposition hope to develop a more conciliatory atmosphere toward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Sun said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Chinese feel confident they have a piece of critical leverage over South Korean politicians,&quot; Sun said. <BR></SPAN></P>
