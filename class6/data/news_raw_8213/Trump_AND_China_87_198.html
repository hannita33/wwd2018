<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Monday pledged to cut regulations by 75% and impose a major &quot;border tax&quot; on goods manufactured abroad and sold in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echoing his campaign rhetoric, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told business leaders in a breakfast meeting at the White House that businesses spend more time on paperwork complying with government regulations than on making things.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to start making our products again,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. &quot;If you look at some of the original great people that ran this country, you will see they felt very strongly about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the border tax would help discourage companies from firing people in the U.S., making products overseas and then moving them back into the country to sell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're going to have to pay a border tax -- a substantial border tax,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president said other countries &quot;charge a lot of tax&quot; when American companies try to sell their products there, and he identified </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You want to sell something into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it's very, very hard, in some cases it's impossible,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. &quot;So I don't call that free trade. What we want is fair trade,  and we're going to treat other countries fairly, but they have to treat us fairly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting included chief executives from a dozen companies, including Ford, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Lockheed Martin and Dell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Liveris, CEO of Dow, said afterward that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asked them to come back in 30 days with &quot;a series of actions&quot; that might stimulate manufacturing in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liveris said the group discussed the border tax and who might be helped or hurt by such a move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford CEO Mark Fields said &quot;it was a very, very positive meeting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson said in a statement  she was &quot;encouraged by the president's commitment to reduce barriers to job creation,&quot; including cutting regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I look forward to continuing to work with President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his team on these important issues,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Press Secretary Sean Spicer said  the meeting was productive and ran longer than expected. He said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans to meet with the group next month and then quarterly after that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that's what his focus is going to continue to be,&quot; Spicer said.</SPAN></P>
