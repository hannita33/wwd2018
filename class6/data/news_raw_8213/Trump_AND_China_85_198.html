</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would the market fare better under a President Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or a President Hillary Clinton?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the question investors of all kinds  are asking now that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Clinton are the presumptive nominees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer, according to some of the nation's top market experts: President Clinton. And, the reason can be summed up in two words: trade war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since she would take a less hostile position toward our trading partners, particularly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mexico, her administration could focus more on growth than protectionism,&quot; says Sam Stovall, managing director of S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others share this view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe the market would fare better under Clinton, in part, because we don't know enough about a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration and the potential adverse consequences of trade wars,&quot; says Bob Doll, senior portfolio manager at Nuveen Asset Management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, another expert says Wall Street dislikes both candidates but ultimately prefers Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the financial markets' standpoint, the choice between Clinton and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is really a choice between the lesser of two evils,&quot; says Bob Johnson, president and CEO of the American College of Financial Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Johnson says, there is little doubt that market participants would rather see a Clinton presidency. &quot;Market participants believe they know more about her positions and that a Clinton presidency wouldn't represent a radical departure from the current regime,&quot; Johnson says. &quot;There is a time-worn adage -- 'the markets dislike uncertainty,' and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> epitomizes uncertainty. There hasn't been a more potentially disruptive candidate than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in recent memory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson recited some of the uncertainty that comes with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has advocated some outlandish positions, including suggesting that the U.S. might be able to 'renegotiate' terms of the debt -- essentially paying creditors less than 100 cents on the dollar,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's said he would repeal trade deals, deport Mexicans and punish corporations that move outside the U.S. All of these actions would destabilize the financial markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winners and losers under Clinton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Clinton presidency would likely be good news for gun and ammo manufacturers, renewable energy companies and consumer staples, experts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It may seem ironic that gun and ammo manufacturers would cheer a Clinton victory (and they would likely do so privately), but the fear of gun-control measures would be good for (them),&quot; Johnson says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wind power and solar companies likely would do well under Clinton &quot;as there would likely be even more tax incentives for renewable energy,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Income could rise for lower middle-class Americans with a President Clinton, and that would be good for consumer staples. &quot;If Clinton would be able to champion an increase in the minimum wage, there would be more money in the pockets of lower-middle-class consumers,&quot; Johnson says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Stovall says managed care companies (HMOs) should benefit from the continued promotion of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). And Doll says health care services would fare better than health care products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One sector likely to be hurt: &quot;Restaurants could be adversely affected by the Democrats' desire to push for a hike in the minimum wage to $15 per hour,&quot; Stovall says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winners and losers under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">trump</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Johnson, winners likely would be traditional energy companies, sectors such as fast-food restaurants that rely on minimum-wage labor and large pharmaceutical firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson also says traditional energy companies such as coal, natural gas and oil companies likely would find a more favorable regulatory environment under a President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Others share that opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Coal could do well, as there would be less emphasis placed on clean-air legislation,&quot; Stovall says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Johnson says, &quot;large pharmaceutical firms would breathe a big sigh of relief if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won, as Clinton has been very outspoken about price gouging by pharmaceutical firms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, perhaps not surprisingly, &quot;health care facilities, ... also known as hospital management companies, would most likely be hurt due to (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) promise to undo the ACA,&quot; says Stovall.</SPAN></P>
