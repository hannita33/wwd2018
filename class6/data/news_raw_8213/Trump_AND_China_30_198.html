<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> takes the oath of office today, he will be among the most famous Americans ever sworn in as president. As a prominent real estate developer and man about town, his life and loves have been a staple of the New York tabloids for decades. He has starred in a reality TV show and been the subject of several biographies. Since he announced his long-shot campaign for president 19 months ago, he has been a constant presence on television and Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all know </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. That is to say, we all know of him. We know about the three wives, the five children, the six bankruptcies, the comeback, The Apprentice, the spectacular marketing of the &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; brand and the stunning victory in November. But the paradox is how little Americans really understand this celebrity who is becoming the 45th president of the United States and the first with no experience in government or the military.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tapped into the hopes and fears of millions of Americans in achieving an electoral victory with a mandate to shake up Washington and make the Rust Belt shine again. He ran atop the GOP ticket, yet he is a Republican-come-lately. Beneath his thin skin, it remains murky what really matters to him and what he holds sacred. The unknowns about the new president are substantial, both from a personal standpoint and a policy one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the personal side:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He ran as a billionaire businessman who could cut great deals for America, but much about his finances remains obscure. That's because of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> steadfast refusal to release his tax returns, like every other major party candidate going back nine elections has done. The absence of those returns also robs the American people of understanding the full extent of potential conflicts </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 70, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the oldest person to assume the presidency, and he's clearly a high-energy individual for his age. Yet we know only basic information about his physical health and little about his mental health. He shows classic signs of narcissism. But do those traits rise to a clinical personality disorder? We don't know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modern presidents are subject to a constant barrage of second-guessing, criticism and ridicule. It comes with the territory. Is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> capable of turning the other cheek? Or will he become consumed with lashing back at his critics? So far -- based on his transition Twitter tiffs with everyone from Meryl Streep to Alec Baldwin to John Lewis -- the evidence isn't encouraging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't know whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a serial sexual aggressor. A dozen women have come forward with accusations, which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has vehemently denied. But the Access Hollywood tape from 2005 -- on which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is heard boasting about grabbing women's genitals -- lends some credence to the accusations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the policy side:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relationship between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Russia remains murky. America's intelligence agencies are convinced that President Vladimir Putin directed a hacking and disinformation campaign to help defeat Hillary Clinton. There are open questions about communication between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign and the Kremlin. And while a salacious, opposition-research report suggesting Putin is blackmailing the president-elect is wholly unverifiable, nagging suspicions remain about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> odd reluctance to criticize the autocratic Russian leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign policy views leave the nation wondering whether he's crazy like a fox -- or merely crazy. He persistently praises Putin while threatening a trade war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He talks one minute of engaging in a nuclear arms race, then another about reaching an agreement with Russia to reduce arsenals. His excellent pick for Defense secretary, James Mattis, accurately describes NATO as &quot;the most successful military alliance probably in modern history, maybe ever.&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> calls it &quot;obsolete&quot; and threatens to undermine the European Union. Is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> being reckless, or is there a larger strategy at work?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> takes office with ill-defined or irreconcilable domestic policy views. For example, he wants to cut taxes, invest in infrastructure and the military, leave Social Security and Medicare alone -- and simultaneously reduce the federal budget deficit. How can you do that? You can't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America and the world have a huge stake in a successful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency. But more than any incoming president in memory, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is surrounded by a swirl of uncertainty about his intentions. This is why the excitement that typically surrounds a presidential inauguration is tempered with trepidation this time around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> willing or able to reach beyond his core supporters in an effort to unite a divided nation? That's another unknown, one that the new president has a prime opportunity to address at today's inauguration. <BR></SPAN></P>
