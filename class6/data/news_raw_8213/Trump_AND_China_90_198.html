<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign chairman said Sunday that President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign may have colluded with the Russian government over hacked e-mails in an effort to swing the election.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very much unknown whether there was collusion,&quot; John Podesta said on NBC's Meet the Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without pointing a finger directly at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Podesta said any ties between the Russian hacking and the president-elect's campaign should be revealed to members of the Electoral College before they confirm the election results Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What did '</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc.' know, and when did they know it?&quot; Podesta said. &quot;Were they in touch with the Russians? I think those are still open questions, and the electors have a right to know what the answers are -- if the United States government has those answers -- before the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many pundits have said the Russians wanted to discredit the U.S. election process but did not necessarily aim to elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Podesta cited examples of direct contacts: Russian diplomats' statements that they were speaking to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> adviser Roger Stone's comments in August that Wikileaks had Podesta's e-mails before they were released; and meetings in Russia before the Republican National Convention between a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign policy adviser and Russian intelligence officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All point to the need for an independent investigation, Podesta said -- something incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., endorsed Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schumer said the special panel should focus on Russia, &quot;but also </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Iran, and their hacking our political system as well as our economic infrastructure and social system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on CNN's State of the Union, McCain said &quot;the Russians and others, Chinese to a lesser degree, have been able to interfere with our electoral process. ... This is serious business. If they are able to harm the electoral process, then they destroy democracy, which is based on free and fair elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has rejected the idea of a new bipartisan panel in favor of a probe by the existing Senate Committee on Intelligence. But Schumer and McCain, along with GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, said only a special committee can gather all the evidence because of existing committees' separate jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Fox News Sunday, incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said even if there eventually is proof of Russian hacking, it's &quot;insane&quot; to think the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign coordinated it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course we didn't interface with the Russians. I mean, this whole thing is a spin job,&quot; Priebus said. Furthermore, he said, &quot;there's no evidence that shows that the outcome of the election was changed because of a couple of dozen John Podesta e-mails.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donna Brazile, interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman, said on ABC's This Week that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> win had more to do with his cracking the &quot;blue wall&quot; of Democratic strongholds in the Midwest, from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin. Still, she said, &quot;Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> used this information in ways to also sow division.&quot;</SPAN></P>
