<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carly Fiorina, U.S. spy chief?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evolution from tech CEO to presidential hopeful to possible director of national intelligence -- an appointment floated Monday by The New York Times, which quoted an unnamed Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team member saying she's under consideration for the role -- reflects Fiorina's dogged pursuit of political superlatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fiorina and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had a &quot;positive and productive meeting&quot; on &quot;issues ranging from America's strategic interests and national security challenges abroad to the geopolitical climate across the world and in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; Fiorina spokesman Frank Sadler said in an email to USA TODAY.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> representative was unavailable for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as Hewlett Packard CEO in the early 2000s, Fiorina was a natural politician with a gift for public speaking and an eye on higher office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 2010 and again as the Republican nominee for president this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, she may be in line for a spot in the administration of President-elect  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the former rival who publicly ridiculed her appearance and whom she asked to drop out of the race shortly before the national election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If she gets the job, she would bring a view of cybersecurity that's at odds with tech's biggest companies, which have declaimed U.S. government efforts to override their encryption as dangerous and a threat to personal privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one-time bitter political foes met Monday at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in New York for what Fiorina called a &quot;productive&quot; discussion about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as &quot;probably our most important adversary and a rising adversary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We talked about hacking, whether it's Chinese hacking or purported Russian hacking,&quot; Fiorina told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Republican primary season, Fiorina urged Apple, Google and others to &quot;tear down cyberwalls&quot; to help track down criminals online, a stance that ran in cross currents to Silicon Valley, which publicly supported Apple in its fight with the FBI over hacking into a terrorist's iPhone, and has been building stronger device encryption in the months since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We could have detected and repelled some of those cyberattacks&quot; if we had passed &quot;a law (that) has been sitting, languishing, sadly, on Capitol Hill,&quot; she said at the first GOP debate last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Beltway insiders are uncertain about the likelihood of a DNI appointment, there is no argument Fiorina would be interested -- notwithstanding </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ugly verbal jousting with her on the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a tumultuous five-year reign as CEO of HP, Fiorina displayed a steely resolve, laser-focused intensity and unbowed self-esteem. That was on full display when she almost single-handedly ushered in HP's $24 billion merger with Compaq Computer despite fierce resistance from HP board members and some employees and a contentious court case in Delaware.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The merger, Fiorina insisted, was crucial to the long-term success of the iconic Silicon Valley-based company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">History, however, has not been kind to Fiorina's judgment. By the time she was forced out of HP in early 2005, the merged HP-Compaq had suffered 30,000 layoffs, and a brutal shareholder showdown fractured its executive ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fiorina steadfastly maintained the megamerger was the victim of the dot-com implosion and a deepening recession in Silicon Valley after the Sept. 11 attacks. She insisted she was vilified for her maverick management style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you lead and when you challenge the status quo, you make enemies,&quot; she wrote in an essay published on CNN.com last year. <BR></SPAN></P>
