<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton told USA TODAY on Wednesday she plans to make the case for why Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is &quot;temperamentally unfit&quot; to manage the nation's economy and pledged to end a tax loophole for wealthy Americans by executive action if necessary in a preview of a second major policy address, scheduled for next week, that casts the real estate mogul as dangerous and unqualified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her first interview after meeting with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday night in Washington, Clinton declined to offer a definitive position on one of his key demands as his Democratic presidential bid winds down: that party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz be replaced.  Clinton praised Wasserman Schultz for her commitment to defeating Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month in San Diego, Clinton delivered a blistering speech that cast </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as too dangerous to serve as the nation's commander in chief because of  his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, lack of foreign policy knowledge and his temperament. She has continued those attacks in the days following Sunday's Orlando nightclub massacre, the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech in Columbus, Ohio, next Wednesday, Clinton said she will make &quot;a similar case on the economy that I did on foreign policy: that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is erratic and temperamentally unfit to be responsible for the world's largest economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton pointed to one example of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;incoherent&quot; economic argument by noting that the billionaire has built his populist appeal around leveling the playing field for lower-income Americans, even though she said his tax plan gives a $3 trillion break to millionaires and billionaires over the next 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She pointed out that his proposal would lower rates for hedge-fund and private equity managers by creating a new, lower 15% bracket. &quot;They would actually see their carried interest rate cut by one-third, making the loophole worse rather than closing it,&quot; she said. Previewing her speech next week, she said, &quot;He's either completely incoherent or he hasn't thought one bit about his plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton said she'll pledge that, if Congress does not act, as president she'll ask the Treasury Department to use its regulatory authority to end a  tax advantage, commonly referred to as the carried-interest loophole, that allows hedge-fund managers to pay a lower rate than other taxpayers by counting their income as investment income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton's speech will seek to undercut </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeal to middle- and lower-income Americans who've been drawn to his populist pledges to bring back manufacturing and coal jobs by slapping fines on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and cutting better trade deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal is to demonstrate how his rhetoric does not match his policies, which would disproportionately favor wealthier Americans, according to the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the meeting with Sanders, the presumptive Democratic nominee did not completely dismiss several of his demands as he refuses to concede the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've seen how committed she is to making sure Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not the president,&quot; Clinton said of Wasserman Schultz. &quot;I've not heard any conversations in the party about changes,&quot; she added, noting the Florida congresswoman was recommended by President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As her campaign vets potential vice presidential candidates, Clinton gave another nod to Sanders, indicating she is prioritizing those with a progressive profile. &quot;We've got a great group of Democrats that are progressive and who agree with me about the direction of the country,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the presumptive GOP nominee has doubled down on his proposed temporary ban on Muslims after the Orlando shooting. Party leaders have been critical of the proposal, yet they have not withdrawn their endorsement of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now he is accusing our president of somehow encouraging terrorists and it is really offensive, even pathetic,&quot; she said. &quot;And I do wonder how Republican leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can stay silent while their presumptive party nominee suggests that the President of the United States supports terrorists.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
