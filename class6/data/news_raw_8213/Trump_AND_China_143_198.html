<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why have an Electoral College? Alexander Hamilton made it plain: to ensure that &quot;the office of president will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications.&quot; It is a safeguard against a demagogue putting our country's values and our security at risk.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since his election, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has ignored his serious conflicts of interest; skipped intelligence briefings while overturning generations of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy; could have emboldened Philippine death squads; attacked the cast of the Broadway play Hamilton for speaking out; told whopping lies on Twitter; trashed our intelligence agencies; and defended the Kremlin from charges of interfering with our elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not a partisan issue. Many honorable Republican leaders agree Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a walking, tweeting negation of core American values: liberty, service, compassion, respect for learning, humility and honor. Zero Republican presidents endorsed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 presidential nominee, said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is &quot;playing the members of the American public for suckers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> exhibits the &quot;talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity&quot; feared by the Founders is up to the electors. Twice in our history, the Electoral College has denied the presidency to winners of the popular vote -- Grover Cleveland and Al Gore -- with no serious charges of election &quot;rigging.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday, it could deny the presidency to a candidate whose qualifications are in question and who  lost the popular vote dramatically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Electoral College need not elect  Hillary Clinton. It could choose a consensus candidate who might begin to heal our fractured republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our Founders wisely provided a mechanism to address this chaotic situation; it is folly not to use it. Thoughtful GOP leaders should join together today to release the electors to vote their conscience -- to save their party and our nation from years of tumult and danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our country would be forever in their debt.</SPAN></P>
