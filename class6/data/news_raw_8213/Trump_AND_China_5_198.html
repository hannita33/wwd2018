<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Dave Shogren, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign-trail threats to impose massive tariffs on imports from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mexico were more than just vote-rousing bluster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were a loaded gun pointed at the heart of his St. Louis-based food-export business. Shogren knew those countries almost certainly would respond in kind, pummeling his sales to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which account for half his business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> threw </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> under the bus, I cringed,&quot; says Shogren, CEO of U.S. International Foods, which exports products such as snack foods, nuts and soft drinks. So he has taken a flurry of trips to his secondary Asian markets in recent months to develop sales leads in case the U.S. finds itself in a trade war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won the presidential race, many U.S. importers and exporters fear his bare-knuckled ultimatums could significantly dent their revenue if he follows through.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are concerned and are just starting to take a look at where they're vulnerable,&quot; says Marianne Rowden, head of the American Association of Exporters and Importers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team couldn't be reached for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few may be more worried than Boeing. A recent editorial in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> state-run Global Times asserts </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;will take a tit-for-tat approach&quot; if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gets tough on trade. &quot;A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus, U.S. auto and iPhone sales in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boeing spokeswoman Kate Bernard says, &quot;Anything that undermines our competitive position is concerning.&quot; Boeing is the largest U.S. exporter with about 70% of its revenue derived from abroad, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is its biggest customer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernard says Boeing executives &quot;are looking forward to working with the (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) administration to protect our markets and interests overseas,&quot; adding that &quot;the losers (in a trade skirmish) are American workers.&quot; Boeing employs 140,000 in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All told, &quot;We have 11.5 million jobs today that depend solely on exports,&quot; Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker said in an interview. &quot;If we start a trade war, don't underestimate. ... There will be consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has dialed back his harshest rhetoric since he won the presidential race. One of his economic advisers, private equity investor Wilbur Ross, told Yahoo Finance, &quot;There aren't going to be trade wars.&quot; Rather, he said, administration officials will coax trading partners like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mexico to buy more goods from the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, even &quot;an aborted trade war&quot; -- in which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> uses threats as a cudgel and then backs off -- could set off financial market turmoil and a shift in supply chains that leads to higher import prices or product shortages, according to a September report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides slapping 35% tariffs on Mexico and 45% on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has threatened to withdraw from the World Trade Organization and rip up existing deals, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. In the end, any restraints on imports are likely to be more modest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services totaling $531.5 billion in 2015, &quot;we are now moving into a different area,&quot; says Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sees it as far more of a zero-sum game. And he sees the U.S. as a loser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> goal: prevent U.S. manufacturers from offshoring their production and convince those that already have to move back to the U.S. Some of them will, but most are likely to relocate to other low-cost countries to skirt any new duties, says Peterson senior fellow Gary Hufbauer. That, he says, could force </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to hit those countries with tariffs as well, spawning new trade battles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, new tariffs would cause U.S. import prices to rise, increasing costs for U.S. consumers. And limiting imports would hurt U.S. companies, such as auto manufacturers that source parts from Mexico. Exporters, particularly in agriculture, would suffer as affected countries retaliate. A full trade war would mean the loss of 4.8 million U.S. jobs, while an aborted conflict would cost 1.3 million jobs, Peterson estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Big companies don't like uncertainties&quot; and are likely already considering early contingency plans, says Peterson senior fellow Sherman Robinson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So are smaller firms. U.S. International Foods has done well because Chinese groceries trust the quality of food made in America, Shogren says. But cashews, for example, are already cheaper from Vietnamese suppliers, and supermarkets would readily switch if tariffs drove up his prices further. Since August, he has been on multiple trade missions to Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Cambodia to expand his customer base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WIN-911, of Austin, which sells software for factory automation, relies on exports for about 15% of its revenue, and that's expected to grow to about 50% in three years, leading to a pickup in hiring, says company Chairman Robert Brooker. But noting that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mexico make up 20% of his exports, he worries about &quot;retaliatory tariffs or other trade restraints from these and other countries that would impede our future growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. pork producers, which export about a quarter of their products, are already hurting from a glut that has depressed prices. If there were new tariffs from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or Mexico, &quot;They'll just cut production,&quot; says David Warner, spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council. That would push up prices for U.S. consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Importers are also nervous, especially small firms that rely on cheaper overseas products to compete with larger companies, says Todd McCracken, president of the National Small Business Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, there are U.S. suppliers of the molds that Progressive Molding Technologies needs to make the medical devices and other plastic products it churns out for its business customers. But the cost from Chinese suppliers is about 55% less, saving his customers tens of thousands of dollars per mold and driving the Medina, Ohio, company's growth the past eight years, says President Laird Daubenspeck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if 45% tariffs were added to the Chinese molds, he would stick with them because they'd still be 10% cheaper than the U.S. versions, he says. But his sales would be hurt substantially because customers would drop products too costly to roll out, jeopardizing his plan to add six workers to his staff of 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some U.S. firms, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the only option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only Chinese suppliers make certain hydraulic parts in large quantities for the construction equipment produced by Cincinnati-based Mesa industries, says CEO Terry Segerberg. Without it, &quot;We would pretty much be up a creek,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the jitters, business leaders are approaching the new administration with a wait-and-see attitude. &quot;Trade is very much going to be at a pause now,&quot; says John Engler, president of the Business Roundtable. &quot;I think (business CEOs) are very hopeful that economic growth will be a top priority. No one's pressing the panic button and saying the world is ending.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boeing is the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">largest U.S. exporter with about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">70%</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of its revenue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">derived from abroad, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is its biggest customer. <BR></SPAN></P>
