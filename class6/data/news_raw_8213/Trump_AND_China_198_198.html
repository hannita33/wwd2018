<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Easing the big Bentley Bentayga away from the curb, you realize rather quickly that this SUV will be unlike any you've ever driven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's uncannily quiet and smooth. It's like this 5,379-pound behemoth rolls on a sheet of glass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next you notice amazing power. For that, we thank the 6-liter, 12-cylinder engine -- one of the last of its gas-guzzling breed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Love it or resent it as you may, just being in the Bentley is a rare pleasure. A chance to spend some road time in a Bentayga is akin to being accidentally locked in a Tiffany store -- an SUV fit for a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's not often that we get to take a spin in a $270,000 vehicle, including options, of any sort. Even at Bentayga's base price of $229,100, you could buy a bevy of conventional U.S. midmarket SUVs for the same outlay -- one for every day of the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bentayga is among the first among a new breed of super-luxury SUVs. Maserati is giving the American introduction to its new Levante SUV next week at the New York Auto Show. Rolls-Royce has its own, the Cullinan, on the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bentayga is filled with little delights. Note how the seats have 16-way power adjustments -- both front and back. Or how little water jets emerge from the otherwise flush front end to squirt grime off the headlights in stormy weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a pleasure to drive. That amazing suspension, my seatmate from Bentley assures me, comes from a high-power computerized system that makes constant adjustments for any surface. Because it's an SUV and off-road capable, Bentayga also has a system that raises and lowers the front and rear ends to provide extra wheel clearance for tearing over sand dunes or thrashing through the snow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process is helped along by controls on the center console that allow drivers to switch the car's terrain mode. There's also comfort, sport and other settings for regular driving. They not only stiffen or loosen the cushiness of the suspension but determine how hard it is to turn the  wheel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bentayga's monster engine is good for 600 horsepower. It can catapult itself from zero to 60 mph in four seconds. Top speed is 187 mph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The engine, like many these days, shuts off at intersections to save fuel. And it has the ability to shut off 6 cylinders when they are not needed. Bentley boasts that it is 10.2% more fuel efficient than its existing 12-cylinder engine, which, in other Bentley models, averages 15 miles a gallon.  Bentayga's mileage rating is yet to be released for the U.S. A gas-electric hybrid option will follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Self-driving? Sort of. The Bentley has adaptive cruise control, so it can track cars in front of it, and does a pretty good job of keeping itself centered in a lane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interior is, as you might expect, sumptuous. Our test car was finished in a shiny &quot;piano black&quot; trim. With no wood grain showing, any material could have done the job. But Bentley assures that it is, yes, real wood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the moment, Bentayga is available only as a two-row SUV. A three-row version is next. In back, Bentley has poured a lot of attention into creating options for the cargo bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The version we tested had a nifty pull-out seat that fits over the tailgate. Our favorite option for the back would have to be the &quot;Integrated Milliner Hamper Set,&quot; which comes with a mini-fridge, &quot;fine Linley </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">china</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cutlery&quot; and crystal glassware. Basically, it's a picnic set straight from Downton Abbey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, Bentley makes much about how its cars can be ordered with pretty much custom anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 17 stock paint colors, but the custom list takes the hues up to 90, though Americans generally will take what they see in a showroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The test car came in purple, the color of royalty. Seemed appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bentley expects to sell about 5,000 Bentaygas a year when deliveries start by early June, about a third of them in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
