</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The image was startling but a look into what could be tech's  future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being ostracized by the  industry for most of the election year, there sat venture capitalist Peter Thiel, beaming, to the left of President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower Tech summit in mid-December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around him was a ring of glum-faced and pensive tech titans, including Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Alphabet's Larry Page and Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silicon Valley's billionaire leaders had disavowed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during the campaign, throwing their weight behind  Hillary Clinton. Only Thiel stumped for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and after the tech industry had turned on him for that and his role in Gawker's failure, he was luxuriating in the I-told-you-so moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The display of power portends a roiling year or two in tech. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> railed against Amazon and Apple in tweets about corporate taxes and cyber security; now he's likely to shape those issues as well as immigration reform, job creation, trade with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> deregulation and more as he vowed during a bruising campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tech is unusual in that the industry does not depend on government regulation or transfer payments the way that banking, pharma, defense, agriculture and energy do,&quot; says Roger McNamee, founding partner of venture-capital firm Elevation Partners. &quot;All tech needs is policy stability and access to global markets. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prides himself on being unpredictable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a topsy-turvy year for tech, which generated $3.5 trillion in domestic economic output and accounted for more than 15 million people, or 8.4% of total U.S. employment, according to the Computer Technology Association. There were winners and losers among companies and technologies; new faces emerged while others faded; and driverless cars and drones became more visible in our streets and sky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High-profile meltdowns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether computer breaches that compromised the personal information of millions of consumers to a targeted hack by Russian operatives that conceivably tilted the U.S. presidential election, the very nature of conflict transformed this year, McNamee says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with the advent of the Internet of Things, the battlefield could extend to our homes, security experts warn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samsung's stumble with the self-igniting Galaxy Note 7 was an epic meltdown of quality control, distribution and marketing. Though it didn't dislodge the South Korean electronics giant as the pre-eminent smartphone seller globally, it undercut  trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yahoo disclosed it had been the victim of two megahacks that compromised more than 1.5 billion accounts and jeopardized its $4.8 billion deal with Verizon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our friends, the bots</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artificial intelligence is officially a craze -- Facebook, Apple, Google and Microsoft are among those with aggressive plans. Virtual reality became more of a reality. Drones are popping up in all shapes and sizes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Self-driving cars took to the streets in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and California. Fully autonomous cars won't be available for a few years, but a Morgan Stanley study estimates they will lead to productivity gains of $507 billion annually as consumers spend less time commuting and more time in meetings, writing reports and other business tasks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bots were ubiquitous, especially in the spread of fake news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was nothing fake, however, over fears on what AI and increased automation will do to the workforce. This is sure to draw the attention of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who lambasted Apple for exporting jobs overseas and discussed jobs creation at the  tech summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> effect</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His focus on immigration reform will undoubtedly pinch H-1B visas and heighten the urgency for increased STEM education. What is unclear is how it might play into tech's stuttering attempts to become less homogenous by hiring more of the women and minorities who buy its products but have little role in their design.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 500,000 computing jobs open in the U.S., with an expected 20% growth rate over the next decade -- yet only 55,000 bachelor degrees in computer science were doled out in 2014, according to Code.org and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's more important than ever,&quot; says Dennis Yang, CEO of Udemy, an online learning marketplace with more than 14 million students in 190 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tech's impasse with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration over job creation seems inevitable, but there may be hope. In his meeting with the reluctant CEOs, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vowed to keep the channels of communication open and meet quarterly. <BR></SPAN></P>
