<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican and Democratic conventions the next two weeks are likely to highlight the sharply divergent economic visions of presidential candidates Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Hillary Clinton and prompt closer scrutiny of their plans.  At the Republican gathering in Cleveland this week, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is expected to lay out his swashbuckling blueprint for shaking up the status quo. The real estate mogul has advocated slashing both personal and business taxes, including for the wealthy, aggressively confronting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on trade, and repealing much of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Clinton is largely proposing to maintain and tweak the Obama administration's policies by raising taxes on the wealthy, investing in infrastructure, lifting the minimum wage and toughening financial reform. Here's a breakdown:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proposes streamlining the seven tax brackets into three, with the top rate falling to 25% from 39.6%. All Americans would pay less in taxes, with the lower-income owing nothing. But high-earning households, who tend to spend less of their savings, would derive the biggest benefits, according to the Tax Policy Center. Itemized deductions would be sharply curtailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The corporate tax rate would fall to 15% from 35%, while the rate for smaller businesses that now pay the personal income tax rate would also drop to 15%. In exchange, most tax breaks would be scrapped. Companies that have stockpiled earnings overseas with their foreign units to avoid U.S. taxes would pay a one-time 10% tax, as well as taxes on future foreign profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impact: The lower rates for both households and companies initially would spur more consumer spending and business investment. And the decline in the corporate rate theoretically should make the U.S. more competitive with other countries, attracting multinationals and creating jobs. Moody's Analytics estimates the economy would grow 3.7% in 2017 under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plan, vs. 3% under current law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the overhaul would cut federal revenue by $9.5 trillion over 10 years, the TPC estimates. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said the loss could be offset by closing tax loopholes, increased income in a more vibrant economy and eliminating government waste, fraud and abuse. But both Moody's and Oxford Economics say the bulk of the gap would have to be financed by more borrowing that swells the deficit. That would cause interest rates to spike, dampening borrowing by both households and businesses and triggering a recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That swamps any benefits you get from lower taxes,&quot; says Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi. Oxford estimates the economy would slide into recession in 2018, and 3 million fewer jobs would be created during his term compared to the status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dan Mitchell, senior fellow at the conservative Cato Institute, says the lower tax rates would be a boon for the economy and could be funded by eliminating some federal departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calls for raising taxes on high-income households, with nearly all of the increases borne by the top 1%, TPC estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton hasn't yet echoed President Obama's call to trim the corporate tax rate to 28%, but Zandi believes she ultimately will adopt a similar plan, making the U.S. more competitive. Like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Clinton intends to discourage the practice of merging with a foreign company to avoid U.S. taxes. Most of the company would have to be owned by foreign shareholders to get the tax benefit. Tax credits also would be offered to businesses that hire apprentices, share profits with employees or invest in communities that face manufacturing job losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impact: The tax proposals would increase federal revenue by $1.1 trillion over the next decade, the TPC says. The windfall would be spent on initiatives such as paid family leave, education and economic development. Zandi says the tax plan largely would be neutral for the economy. Oxford economist Gregory Daco says the spending programs would provide a modest boost to growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is taking a bareknuckled approach to the nation's massive trade deficit with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He wants to declare </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a currency manipulator because of its past efforts to push down the value of the yuan, bolstering its exports at the expense of U.S. shipments to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He has threatened to slap a 45% tariff on Chinese imports and a 35% tariff on Mexican imports. He opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal with Pacific Rim countries, which Congress has not ratified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impact: Such hefty duties would almost certainly trigger retaliation from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mexico, crimping exports to those countries and hurting U.S. economic growth, Zandi says. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he's aiming to bring thousands of manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But Zandi says it's unlikely companies will take such a step given the uncertainty of how long the tariffs would remain in place. And Daco says U.S. companies doing business in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be unlikely to quickly shift to the U.S., where they'll have to pay significantly higher wages. Also, large tariffs would increase U.S. consumer prices by 3% within 18 months, Zandi says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has called his threats a negotiating strategy. And Cato's Mitchell says it could be effective if it works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says she wants to crack down on Chinese currency manipulation, and her website says she'll &quot;stand up to Chinese abuses.&quot; She has not been specific but says she'll triple the number of trade enforcement officers. She initially supported the Trans-Pacific trade deal but reversed herself during her campaign against Bernie Sanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impact: Would largely retain President Obama's open trade policies that have supported U.S. exports, Zandi says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minimum wage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially said he opposes a hike in the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage. Months later, he said he supports a higher pay floor for American workers but would prefer to leave it to the states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impact: Little or none, as he largely would maintain the status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supports a boost in the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour. Also says she'll encourage states and localities to go further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impact: A Congressional Budget Office study in early 2014 found that increasing the federal minimum to $10.10 an hour within two years would lift 900,000 people out of poverty but result in 500,000 fewer jobs. Daco, however, says that if the increase is implemented gradually, it would just modestly temper hiring while boosting consumer spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Infrastructure investment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doesn't have a specific proposal but says he has discussed a &quot;trillion-dollar rebuilding plan&quot; to revamp the nation's crumbling highways, bridges, airports and waterways, according to New York magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impact: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says the initiative would create 13 million jobs, in line with the jobs candidate Bernie Sanders said his $1trillion infrastructure plan would generate. Each dollar invested in infrastructure bolsters productivity and increases gross domestic product by about $1.23 a year later, Moody's says. The question is how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would pay for the program while cutting more than $9 trillion in tax revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wants to spend $275 billion over the next five years and create a $25 billion infrastructure bank to support projects. Would fund the plan by closing corporate tax loopholes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impact: It would increase economic growth by 0.3 percentage points the first year, Daco says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dodd-Frank financial reform</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says he would dismantle most of the 2010 law passed in the wake of the financial crisis. It created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and requires large banks to keep more capital buffers, among other things. He has said it has restricted bank lending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impact: Modification of targeted provisions in the law could bolster economic growth, Daco says. But a wholesale repeal would wreak havoc for banks, which have spent millions to implement it, Zandi says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would defend the law and expand it by imposing a &quot;risk fee&quot; on the largest banks, toughen a rule that bars them from making risky trades with their own accounts and tax high-frequency trading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impact: Additional constraints on financial firms could have a small negative effect on the economy, Daco says, while further reducing the odds of another crisis. <BR></SPAN></P>
