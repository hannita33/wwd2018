<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The auto industry's showdown with Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over made-in-Mexico, sold-in-the-U.S. vehicles revved up Tuesday as  General Motors and Ford  moved to fend off attacks on their commitment to American manufacturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ford announced it would cancel a planned  $1.6 billion Mexico plant and expand a Michigan factory, creating 700 jobs, after withering criticism from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, General Motors was forced to defend its Chevrolet Cruze production in Mexico after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweeted: &quot;Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The developments illustrate the new era of give-and-take for Detroit's Big 3 automakers, whose relationship with the president-elect figures to be complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On one hand, there's a gaping divide between U.S. automakers and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on trade. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to renegotiate or trash the industry's treasured North American Free Trade Agreement, which he blames for weakening American manufacturing. He also has threatened  a 35% tariff on American companies' products made overseas and sold in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other ways, however, the auto industry is welcoming change, even after eight years of a White House that rescued GM and Chrysler from liquidation. &quot;Automakers are facing a situation where they have to consider the political consequences&quot; of their decisions, AutoTrader.com analyst Michelle Krebs says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some key questions for automakers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Does moving production back to the U.S. lead to higher costs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Yes. Labor costs for automotive assembly are 80% lower in Mexico than in the U.S., according to a report in August 2016 by the Center for Automotive Research. Although security and transportation costs are higher in Mexico, the country still offers considerably lower cost of production, particularly on small, fuel-efficient cars with thin profit margins.  So shifting production back to the U.S. likely would hurt the bottom line for automakers and suppliers. &quot;That could have a pretty substantial impact on profitability,&quot; LMC Automotive analyst Jeff Schuster says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Are threats of tariffs enough to prompt  companies to bring back manufacturing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Hard to say, since details are lacking. But few in the industry believe the threatened 35% tariff is actually feasible. &quot;I believe 35% is almost inflammatory,&quot; says Michael Harley, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book, noting Ford's 2016 profitability could have been wiped out if it had to pay the tariff. &quot;It gets everyone's attention, but it's nearly impossible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the pressure on the auto industry  could be persistent. That could have major ramifications on future decisions on automakers' global operations. &quot;We're going to see pressure from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his tweets, and you are going to see public scrutiny,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Does Ford's announcement portend similar moves by other automakers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Possibly, especially if  automakers can pull off announcements that generate  headlines for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to trumpet while making few substantive changes to their actual policies. Optics may matter more than substance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But don't expect a significant shift in manufacturing from Mexico to the U.S. The Center for Automotive Research projected that the U.S. share of North American automotive production would fall from an all-time low of 63% in 2016 to 58% in 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Will all these moves lead to higher car prices?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Not for now. If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> follows through on the threat of a 35% tariff, Mexican-made cars will likely become more expensive for American consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theoretically, though, &quot;it might end up with more jobs here,&quot; Center for Automotive Research analyst Kristin Dziczek says. &quot;If we have more jobs, more employment and wages go up, and prices go up too, that's OK. If wages don't go up and prices go up, that's a problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Why might the auto industry capitulate  on Mexico?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Ulterior motives. Although expanding in Mexico makes financial sense, automakers may be willing to relinquish some Mexico production plans in exchange for  concessions in other areas. Currying favor with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration is  important to the auto industry, which wants Washington to loosen fuel-economy regulations and avoid a potentially devastating trade war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ford's move reflects that strategy, Schuster says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's clearly a lot going on that's below the surface of this,&quot; Schuster says. &quot;It's likely to gain some influence on other activities that's coming down the road.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
