<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why aren't Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> businesses held to the same standard as the Clinton family's charity? Republicans Karl Rove and Newt Gingrich have piously called for the Clinton Foundation to be shuttered. USA TODAY says it should be wound down and its important work transferred elsewhere. The New York Times proposes that a giant wall be built between anyone named Clinton and the foundation if Hillary Clinton wins the White House -- a wall that presumably will be paid for by the millions of people the charity helps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, there has been little to no discussion about how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could be the most indebted major party candidate for president in U.S. history, while also being the least transparent nominee since Watergate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters still have no idea how much self-proclaimed billionaire </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to cut his own taxes. Without his tax returns, which he has promised and failed to release two dozen times since 2011, voters have no idea if the Republican nominee for president even pays any taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">$650 million in debt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> companies represent a vast array of properties, investments and licenses around the world. And these businesses also appear to hold at least $650 million in debt to a variety of lenders, including Goldman Sachs, the Bank of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Deutsche Bank, which is probably not German for &quot;America First.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the reportedly huge debt and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> six corporate bankruptcies, we have to assume the exclusive goal of these ventures is profit -- at least for him. He received millions in compensation as his casinos went broke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization's golf courses, resorts and various other holdings don't get in involved with anything as sordid as saving the lives of AIDS patients. Even so, anyone who cares about the office of the presidency should be calling for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his family to completely divest from his business interests should he be elected president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The candidate's three oldest children, Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr., are all executive vice presidents of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization. He has suggested that they will take over day-to-day operations of his company, shunning the &quot;blind trust&quot; that nearly all modern presidents have relied on to avoid the appearance of any conflict of interest. Instead of avoiding suspicions, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is -- as usual -- encouraging them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even if it's strangers instead of his kids running his business, it's impossible to separate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interests from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization. &quot;To put your identity into a blind trust is a little bit difficult,&quot; government professor Andrew Rudalevige told NPR. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> identity is literally his business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'My own feelings'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the value of the conglomerate is  tied not only to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name but also to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mood. In a 2009 deposition, he said his net worth &quot;goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his wealth and his &quot;feelings&quot; on the line, U.S. policies will become inextricable from the president's business strategy. Would a country win favor from the most powerful nation in the world by propping up </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> businesses? Would the president avoid conflict with a nation that offers him sweet tax credits?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many people believe that a fortunate son whose entire life has been about leaving his even more fortunate kids a conglomerate larger than his parents left him -- and now eliminating any taxes they might pay on their inheritance -- would put the nation's interests over his own?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Probably about as many as those who believe that Mexico will pay for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> imaginary border wall -- 13% in a recent poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We saw candidate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prioritize profit over sense when he took a few days off in the middle of his presidential campaign to open a golf course in the swing state of Scotland. And we have decent evidence that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> overwhelming interest in his own interests wouldn't change even if he happened to win in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this Jackson Pollock landscape of a presidential election, one of the most revealing splatters mostly went unnoticed. This summer, we learned that the last time </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> considered running for president, in 2011, he reportedly pitched NBC the idea of filming Celebrity Apprentice from the White House, as president of United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presumably, each episode would have ended with one of the members of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> celebrity Cabinet being fired -- or deported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a not too surprising peek into the mind-set of a reality star who sees everything, including the job of the most powerful person in the world, as fodder for his TV career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the world can live without the Clinton Foundation, we'll find a way to make do without </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> home furnishings.</SPAN></P>
