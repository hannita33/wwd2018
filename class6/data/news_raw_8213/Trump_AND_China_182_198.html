<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hispanic population living in the USA is growing at the slowest rate since official record-keeping began nearly 50 years ago, according to a report released Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hispanics grew by an average of more than 5% annually throughout the 1970s, '80s and '90s, driving much of the population growth in the country. According to a new report from the Pew Research Center, that number started falling in 2007 with the Great Recession and continued to slide to a record-low 2.1% growth rate in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic research at Pew and a co-author of the report, said the drop is because of lower levels of legal and illegal immigration to the USA from Mexico and lower birthrates among Hispanics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These two together are slowing Hispanic population growth at the national level,&quot; Lopez said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report comes as immigration and the role of Hispanics in the USA continue to play a central role in the presidential election. Republican Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has focused his campaign on stopping illegal immigration and slowing legal immigration, while Democrat Hillary Clinton has vowed to protect some undocumented immigrants from deportation, trying to maximize her appeal with Hispanic voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lopez said Hispanics continued driving much of the country's growth in recent years, accounting for 54% of the nation's population growth since 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As fewer Hispanic immigrants enter the country and more Hispanics settle into their communities, the group is not spreading around the country as widely as it once did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The share of U.S. counties with at least 1,000 Hispanics grew from 27% in 1990 to 38% in 2000 and 46% in 2007, according to the report. Since then, the share of U.S. counties with at least 1,000 Hispanics has grown only 4%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lopez said the counties that remain with small numbers of Hispanics are mostly remote places that don't have job markets to lure large numbers of people, Hispanic or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're talking about counties in rural Alaska or rural Montana,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe the Latinos have dispersed across all the counties that have economic opportunities for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report highlighted the rise in immigration from other countries, including </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and India. The growth rate of the Asian population in the USA is higher than the Hispanic population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, said that's partly because the large number of Hispanics in the USA makes it difficult to maintain such a high growth rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 55 million Hispanics in the USA, which represents 17.4% of the population. Capps said it's difficult to imagine that Hispanics could return to the days of 5% annual growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexico's economy has improved, meaning fewer people are immigrating to the USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other findings from the report:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only areas that saw drops in their Hispanic population from 2007 to 2014 were focused in a rural corner of western Texas, southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. Lopez said those are agricultural areas with older populations, meaning people are dying faster than immigrants are moving in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 72% of Hispanics in counties with the fastest-growing Hispanic populations speak English proficiently, compared with the national average of 68%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The states with the largest number of Hispanics remained California (15 million), Texas (10.4million), Florida (4.8 million), New York (3.7 million) and Illinois (2.2 million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">States where Hispanics make up the largest percentage of the population are New Mexico (48%), California (39%), Texas (39%), Arizona (31%) and Nevada (28%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pew conducted its review using data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The bureau began counting Hispanics in 1970. <BR></SPAN></P>
