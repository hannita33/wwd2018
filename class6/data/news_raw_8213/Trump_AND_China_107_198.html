<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple CEO Tim Cook said he felt it was necessary to &quot;engage&quot; when President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- who has railed against Apple and other tech firms -- invited him and about a dozen tech executives to attend a summit in New York last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Personally, I've never found being on the sideline a successful place to be,&quot; Cook told employees on Apple's internal employee information service. &quot;The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it's in this country, or the European Union, or in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or South America, we engage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it's very important to do that because you don't change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best. In many ways, it's a debate of ideas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments were first reported by news site TechCrunch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cook and some of tech's biggest names -- Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, among them -- met with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to discuss jobs, immigration policy, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, cybersecurity and corporate tax rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of our key areas of focus are on privacy and security, education,&quot; Cook said. &quot;They're on advocating for human rights for everyone, and expanding the definition of human rights. They're on the environment and really combating climate change, something we do by running our business on 100% renewable energy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who dinged Apple over security and jobs and Amazon on corporate taxes, told the assembled execs at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower, &quot;I want to add that I'm here to help you folks do well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called the meeting productive, but many in Silicon Valley questioned the participation of the executives, most of whom supported Democrat Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cook offered a reason his CEO brethren probably agree with -- better to participate than pass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We very much stand up for what we believe in,&quot; Apple's CEO concluded. &quot;We think that's a key part of what Apple is about. And we'll continue to do so.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
