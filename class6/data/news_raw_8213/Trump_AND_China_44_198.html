<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration will carry over more than 50 key Obama administration officials after Inauguration Day as  he tries to ensure continuity while putting his own team in place, the transition team said Thursday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them: Adam Szubin, the acting Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence whose nomination by Obama was stalled in the Senate for 20 months. He will serve as the acting Treasury secretary until </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nominee Steven Mnuchin is confirmed by the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> announced his intent to nominate former Georgia governor Sonny Perdue as Agriculture secretary on Thursday, the last of 21 Cabinet-level nominations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That leaves more than 5,000 lower-level appointments to be made, including the important deputy and assistant Cabinet secretaries often charged with running the departments day to day. The incoming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration emphasized Thursday that people would be in place to respond to national security threats or natural disasters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York Jets owner Woody Johnson has been tapped to serve as President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ambassador to the United Kingdom, a transition official confirmed Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> himself alluded to the diplomatic post for Johnson on Thursday, referring to him as &quot;ambassador&quot; during remarks at a celebratory luncheon in downtown Washington. At one point, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Johnson was &quot;going to St. James,&quot; a reference to the official title held by the top U.S. diplomat in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transition official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the nomination has not been formally announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson, a veteran Republican fundraiser and donor, served as a top fundraiser for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Republican National Committee during the general election battle.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attended a luncheon with several of his Cabinet picks Thursday, and it seemed he just couldn't help but gush about them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He name-checked South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, his choice to be United Nations ambassador.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're going to send her over to speak to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We're going to send her over to speak to everybody,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. &quot;I think we're going to do a lot of great things, Nikki, right? Thank you for going through this, you did a fantastic job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lamented the Democratic gantlet of criticism run by Tom Price, whom he picked to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They wanted to end his career so fast, and then they found out, 'man, he's smart,'&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a lot of smart people. ... We have by far the highest IQ of any Cabinet ever,&quot; he quipped to the crowd at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Hotel in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporters were escorted out of the room shortly afterward, just minutes after the remarks began.</SPAN></P>
