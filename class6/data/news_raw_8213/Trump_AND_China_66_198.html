<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory in the presidential election Tuesday is likely to intensify business uncertainty in the near term and slow economic growth  the next few years as the U.S.  retreats from open-trade policies that have defined the past generation and cracks down on undocumented workers, economists say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those policies could more than offset a jolt to consumer and business spending from tax cuts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts  have tamped down forecasts calling for a  recession by 2018 based on the assumption that even a Republican Congress will pass only modified versions of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposals. Some economists say the Federal Reserve is likely to forgo an anticipated interest rate hike in December and  keep rates lower for longer, mitigating some of the damage to  growth and financial markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not a cataclysmic event for the economy,&quot; says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. But, he adds, &quot;at the very least, it means the economy will grow more slowly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many firms are likely to be gripped by anxiety. &quot;The uncertainty ... will cause businesses to be more cautious in their hiring and investment,&quot; Zandi says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uneasiness will be greatest for multinationals that depend on exports for much of their revenue and businesses that employ legal and illegal immigrants, says economist Gus Faucher of PNC Financial Services Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, Zandi expects the economy to grow an average 1.75% a year in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> term, down from a 2% baseline, creating 400,000 fewer jobs annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a look at some of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposals and what they could mean for the economy:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to slash taxes across the board for households by combining the seven tax brackets into three. The top rate would fall to 33% from 39.6%. All Americans would pay less taxes, but the biggest benefits would go to the wealthy, according to the Tax Policy Center. The savings should boost consumer spending  the next two years, Zandi says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporate tax rates would plunge to 15% from 35%, and the rate for smaller businesses that pay the personal rate would drop to 15%. That should help make the USA a more attractive location for multinationals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tax revenue would fall by $6.2 trillion over the next decade, the TPC says. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says the shortfall could be closed by new revenue from a more vibrant economy and spending cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zandi expects a debt-wary Congress to pass only about a third of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cuts. Still, he says, the deficit would swell and interest rates would rise, curbing borrowing and economic activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is likely to make good on his pledge to declare </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a currency manipulator because of its efforts to push down the value of the yuan, Zandi says. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has threatened tariffs of 45% on Chinese imports and 35% on Mexican products, and wants to kill a proposed trade deal with Pacific Rim countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More likely, Zandi says, are modest tariffs and tougher inspection and other standards that curb imports, raising prices for U.S. consumers. That could spark retaliation by affected countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aims to coax manufacturers that have moved jobs abroad to return to the USA and discourage offshoring by U.S. manufacturers. Zandi says such a scenario is unlikely because of uncertainty over whether the trade barriers will be permanent. Faucher says the tariffs are unlikely to outweigh offshoring's other benefits, such as lower overseas wages and taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigrant workers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to deport millions of undocumented immigrants and build a wall along the Mexican border. Undocumented workers make up about 5% of the labor force, and the departure of some would make it tougher for employers to find employees, Zandi says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Infrastructure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unveiled a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that his advisers say  would add nothing to the deficit and create 13 million jobs. Private firms would invest $167billion funded by tax credits passed by Congress, and the rest would be financed by debt, due to low interest rates. <BR></SPAN></P>
