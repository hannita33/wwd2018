<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">631 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mae Leng, a software engineer from the San Francisco area, heard U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio make a reference to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during an early January campaign speech in Boone, she patiently waited for him to finish and walked up to speak directly with the candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leng, a native of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who is now a U.S. citizen, chatted with Rubio about American relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not the kind of experience she could have had in California -- or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, for that matter. Only in Iowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Personally, I feel this is much better of an experience compared to watching them on TV,&quot; said Leng, who noted she is neither a Republican nor a Democrat. &quot;We are an immigrant family from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, love the American democracy and freedom, and would like to make our contributions as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the diners, gymnasiums and coffee shops that make up Iowa's campaign trail, prospective voters are joined by countless caucus tourists who flock here to snag a front-row seat to the kickoff of the presidential nominating contest. Some come to observe; others come to throw their support behind a candidate. And others come to take advantage of Iowa's media spotlight to advance their own causes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, Iowa is a place where  people can secure face time with the next president, ask a pointed question or snap a selfie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some caucus tourists quickly hop over from neighboring states to catch a glimpse of their favorite candidates. Others travel from the farthest reaches of both coasts. And some are so drawn to the political process that they decide to call Iowa home -- at least for a little while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last April, Rob and Claudia Host moved from Hawaii to West Des Moines so they could volunteer for Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't describe us as political junkies by any means,&quot; Rob Host said. &quot;But we'd watched the Iowa caucuses from afar and we thought, 'What would it be like to live in Iowa during the caucuses?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Iowans get in on the act as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the John Wayne Birthplace Museum in Winterset on Tuesday, Ryan Comstock of Clive, Iowa, found himself waiting for the third time in five days to catch a glimpse of businessman and Republican presidential candidate Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- the man he plans to caucus for on Feb. 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm an autograph collector, too, so that's part of the draw for me,&quot; Comstock said. &quot;But he's always entertaining. Every time you see him, you kind of warm up a little bit to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One morning last week, Justin Scott all but ran to the microphone to ask the first question of Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am an atheist voter. ... How do you plan to stand up for all Americans, not just believers or Christians?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fiorina was the eighth candidate whom Scott, 34, has videotaped. Scott, a professional photographer from Waterloo, said he was inspired by activists working to raise the visibility and understanding of atheists. And with each new video he posts, he said, he hopes to highlight the importance of the separation of church and state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walter Pesaresi, like many dedicated Ben Carson supporters, was first enamored by the retired brain surgeon the moment he called out President Obama at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said, 'That man needs to be president,'&quot; recalled Pesaresi, who's 65. &quot;Then I said, 'No, he's too good for politics.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month, the former middle school American history teacher carved out half a week to trail Carson across Iowa -- though he lives in Manhattan, Kan., where his caucus vote must wait until March 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pesaresi said he doesn't believe the polling numbers that show Carson trailing in Iowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's going to do it,&quot; he said. &quot;He's going to come in either first or second.&quot;</SPAN></P>
