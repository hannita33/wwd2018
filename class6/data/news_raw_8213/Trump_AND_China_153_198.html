<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congressman Darrell Issa on Wednesday re-introduced legislation to change eligibility requirements for H-1B visa exemptions and limit the outsourcing of jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Protect and Grow American Jobs Act, co-authored by Issa, R-Calif., and U.S. Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., addresses what's sure to be a hot-button issue this year amid repeated vows by President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to overhaul immigration laws. But it faced opposition last year in Congress and could encounter more resistance this time around.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who has worked on immigration overhaul for more than a decade and frequently discussed the topic with Issa, says the bill would hurt Silicon Valley -- which includes her district -- and plans to introduce legislation of her own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome to the tech political climate in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reshaping immigration is a central tenet of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> push for companies, in particular tech, to invest and hire more in the U.S. He has directed his wrath at Apple for its vast offshore operations in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Ireland, underscoring his frayed relationship with the tech community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issa's legislation &quot;will ensure that our valuable high-skilled immigration spots are used by companies when the positions cannot be filled by the existing workforce,&quot; Issa said in a statement. It was inspired after Disney, Southern California Edison and other companies came under fire for skirting the visa program to replace American workers with less-expensive foreign workers from overseas, a spokesman for Issa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In essence, the bill is intended to close a loophole in the nation's high-skilled immigration system being used by some companies to import cheaper foreign labor, its proponents say. It would raise the salary requirement for the positions to $100,000 a year, up from $60,000, and eliminate the master's degree exemption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lofgren says the bill &quot;doesn't do anything&quot; to stop outsourcing and will prompt companies that abuse the program to concentrate in higher-paying areas where $100,000 would still undercut American wages. (The median income in Silicon Valley is $115,000, she says, with engineers commanding more than $140,000 for starting pay.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says: &quot;It is clear (Issa) is feeling the heat to do something with outsourcing a major issue in his district,&quot; which comprises northern portions of San Diego County and southern Orange County. <BR></SPAN></P>
