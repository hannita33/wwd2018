<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contours of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign policy are becoming disturbingly clear. Newspapers have labeled his thinking on international affairs &quot;isolationist&quot; and &quot;unabashedly non-interventionist,&quot; yet those terms fail to capture the more alarming elements of his philosophy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> apparently is prepared to abandon the United States' most important alliances, even at the risk of those countries acquiring nuclear weapons. In other words, he is prepared to end the decades-long U.S. policy of extended deterrence -- protecting close partners against nuclear attack and thereby limiting the spread of nuclear weapons. Moreover, the presidential candidate gives little indication that he understands the implications of these radical policies for global security and stability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One theme running through </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign policy is his disdain for U.S. alliances and allies.  He has called U.S. treaties &quot;one-sided,&quot; labeled NATO &quot;obsolete&quot; and repeatedly called on South Korea and Japan to contribute more to U.S. basing costs overseas. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeared surprised in a Washington Post interview to learn that allies pay a substantial portion of U.S. overseas basing costs, with none more supportive than Japan. Yet he also seemed unmoved by this information, insisting that allies should pay no less than a full 100% of U.S. overseas costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arms race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A refusal to do so would force a President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to begin withdrawing troops, he told The New York Times. When informed this might cause South Korea and Japan to acquire nuclear weapons, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrated a flippant comfort, stating that the U.S. &quot;may very well be better off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It hardly bears noting that abandoning U.S. treaty commitments and acquiescing to nuclear proliferation are completely at odds with decades of U.S. foreign policy. In the darkest days of World War II, American civilian and military leaders identified the merits of establishing a network of overseas bases to allow the United States to address foreign military threats before they could reach the homeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, since after its own use of nuclear weapons against Japan, the U.S. opposes any  countries developing nuclear weapons, on the theory that more arsenals would lead to a more dangerous world, no matter who owned the weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political science studies show that countries under a major power's &quot;nuclear umbrella&quot; are far less likely to seek their own weapons. The converse holds true: When allies grow  concerned about whether their security patron will make good on  treaty promises, they are more likely to seek an independent arsenal. When the U.S. began a major troop withdrawal from Asia during the Nixon administration, Japan and South Korea considered going nuclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Unpredictable' policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To understand why </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> views on extended deterrence are terrifying, one must examine his other positions on nuclear policy and strategy. In a December debate, he appeared to be unfamiliar with the nuclear triad, made up of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and bombers that can deliver nuclear weapons to their targets. Just days ago, he refused to rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State terrorist group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of the many national security non sequiturs in his Times interview, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commented that no one could be sure whether the U.S. nuclear arsenal even worked. This was presumably an allusion to the fact that America observes a de facto moratorium on nuclear testing, but it is contrary to all scientific and technical evidence and a wildly misleading comment at best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps most unsettling, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repeatedly insists that the United States must be more &quot;unpredictable&quot; in its national security policy. His naivet&eacute; about the world's most dangerous weapons leads one to infer that he might not have considered the fact that a nuclear Japan and South Korea could lead to dangerous arms races with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and North Korea, proliferation by other states in East Asia and regional instability that invites major crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign policy interviews might appear to be itinerant ramblings, but on at least one issue, he is crystal clear: He is absolutely not sold on the role that alliances and extended deterrence have played in U.S. global security policy since 1945. Coupled with his erratic nuclear policy positions, this prospective commander in chief's views are not just irresponsible: They are cataclysmically dangerous.</SPAN></P>
