<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After delegates to the Republican National Convention officially selected Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mike Pence as their candidates Tuesday, they set their sights on Hillary Clinton amid excoriating speeches and cries of &quot;Lock her up!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is scheduled to accept the nomination in a speech Thursday. He appeared on video high above the convention floor to thank the convention. &quot;This is a movement, but we have to go all the way,&quot; he said. &quot;We are going to win the presidency and bring real change and leadership back to Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indiana Gov. Mike Pence was heralded by the state's lieutenant governor, Eric Holcolm, as &quot;a great man of integrity, a proven conservative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It didn't take long for the ebullient mood to turn negative as a parade of speakers castigated Democrat Hillary Clinton over her e-mail controversy, the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya, and even her treatment of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie listed what he called Clinton's crimes around the world, from Cuba to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> each time asking the crowd, &quot;Guilty or not guilty?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guilty!&quot; came the response each time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharon Day, co-chair of the Republican National Committee,  targeted former president Bill Clinton's private life -- a theme likely to be repeated over the next couple of days. &quot;As first lady, you viciously attacked women who were sexually abused at the hands of your husband,&quot; Day said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Speaker Paul Ryan, who came late to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bandwagon, sought to bring the party together with a more positive, policy-oriented message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without much mention of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he called for the election of &quot;a conservative governing majority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What do you say that we unify this party?&quot; he said. &quot;Let's get on the offensive, and let's stay there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signs of continuing discord were evident off the convention floor. In the midst of the roll call, Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- who placed third in the nomination contest -- wasn't even in the hall. He was speaking to members of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a political campaign, what you say should be what you mean,&quot; Kasich said, adding that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> convention &quot;is not where I think I need to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As soon as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweeted about the roll call, Clinton's campaign responded by urging supporters to text, register and &quot;make sure he never becomes president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the night, Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and vanquished presidential candidates Christie and Ben Carson were among those who urged a united effort to defeat Clinton, the leader in most national polls. <BR></SPAN></P>
