<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversial director Oliver Stone gives bad reviews to both major presidential candidates, saying Democrat Hillary Clinton &quot;scares me&quot; because of her hard-line foreign policies, and Republican Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is &quot;too erratic&quot; for the Oval Office.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stone faulted Clinton and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for ignoring  issues such as the government's cyberwarfare and surveillance capabilities, the focus of his new movie, Snowden. The biopic, out Sept. 16, is the chronicle of National Security Agency whistle-blower Edward Snowden, the contractor who lives in Moscow after leaking classified documents in 2013 that revealed massive government surveillance of Americans as well as foreigners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These candidates have not talked about cyberwarfare and Snowden. They are staying away from it,&quot; Stone said Thursday. &quot;What kind of election is this? ... It's trivial, superficial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oscar-winning Stone, who made critically acclaimed box-office hits such as Wall Street and Platoon, has been at the center of numerous controversies over the story lines of his films on political subjects such as John F. Kennedy's assassination, Richard Nixon and George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Handicapping the  election, Stone said, &quot;I don't think </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has a chance.&quot; The director said, &quot;I will eat my hat -- I don't have a hat. I will eat my (expletive) shirt if he wins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under a Clinton presidency, Stone said, &quot;we're in for an even rockier road: more war, more violence, more death.&quot; Stone said he might vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein or Libertarian Gary Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stone  agreed with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the NATO alliance should be re-examined now that its original enemy, the Soviet Union, no longer exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether he has another political project in mind, Stone said with a laugh, &quot;Make fun of Hillary Clinton. ... </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not as much a threat, but a good comedy on Hillary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stone said he hopes Snowden will focus the public's attention on U.S. cyberwarfare programs that are  used as  weapons against countries around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movie details the extent of U.S. covert activities in this field. In one scene, a cyberwarfare team in Hawaii accidentally causes a power blackout throughout Syria in 2012, but the United States blamed the outage on Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is fighting a rebellion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stone said he talked to Snowden nine times to make sure the movie provided an accurate account of the classified programs Snowden had been assigned to or knew about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director complained that the United States accuses  Russia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and North Korea of hacking U.S.  computers but is mum about its own hacking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans need to re-examine government policies that have led to so many wars and own up to a troubled history, Stone said. In a twist on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Make America great again&quot; slogan, he said, &quot;We need to think about what we are. Let's make America honest again.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
