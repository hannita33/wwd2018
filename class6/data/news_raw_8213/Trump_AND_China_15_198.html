<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crossing President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> path is proving to be treacherous, and he's not even in office yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Areas of the market </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> waged a war of words against -- especially tech firms, emerging markets including </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Brazil and Mexico and beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act -- are being hit on the stock market. These drubbings quantify just how different </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> expected administration will be and how costly being on the wrong side appears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Investors are already repositioning their portfolios in favor of what they view as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration policies,&quot; says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at money management firm BMO Private Bank. &quot;Seemingly quiet trading on the surface masks the turbulence that's going on underneath.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors already are taking </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at his word to roll back long-standing policies toward free trade, health care reform and push for changes in the technology industry. Some of the areas to suffer already include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology stocks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been conspicuously left out of the market's rally since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory.  The Nasdaq 100, an index of the largest non-financial stocks in the Nasdaq, is down 1.2% since the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election, lagging the 1.3% rally by the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and 2.6% rise by the Dow Jones industrial average. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has routinely fingered technology firms as a source of job losses and low tax rates. Amazon.com (AMZN) has especially been in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cross hairs. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is the owner of The Washington Post, which has been a steady critic of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has accused Amazon of controlling too much of domestic commerce and paying too little in taxes. Shares of Amazon.com are down 5.8% since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won the election, making it the 13th-worst-performing stock in the Nasdaq 100. Bezos on Thursday tweeted a congratulations to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But Amazon.com isn't alone as Apple (AAPL) has been targeted by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> due to its heavy reliance on overseas manufacturing. Apple is down 3% since the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emerging markets. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has routinely railed against several of the U.S. international trade pacts, stating these deals put other nations at a bigger advantage than the U.S. Investors expect revisions to these trade agreements that could slow down trade with other countries. That belief is priced into various emerging markets stocks. The Vanguard Emerging Markets exchange-traded fund sank 5.5% over the past few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all emerging nations will be hurt equally, according to research by money management firm Causeway Capital. &quot;The disposal or renegotiation of trade deals would disproportionally hurt those economies with a significant dependence on exports such as Taiwan, India, South Korea and Mexico,&quot; the report says. &quot;We expect more domestically focused economies, such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Thailand and Indonesia, to be less affected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospitals. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> effect on health care is largely yet to be determined, but investors are already assuming the worst for hospitals. Seeing the repeal of Obamacare will likely increase the number of uninsured patients going to hospitals, which will be a cost for them. Tenet Healthcare (THC) is the second-worst-performing stock in the S&amp;P 1500 since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won, declining 28%. In fact, health care facilities companies account for four of the 15 worst-performing stocks since the election, which is more than any other industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors' fears may prove overblown, though.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans to lower corporate tax rates might encourage tech companies holding cash overseas to bring it to the U.S. and boost dividends. <BR></SPAN></P>
