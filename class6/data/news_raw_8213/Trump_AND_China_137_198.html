</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">504 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the campaign, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> described human-caused climate change as a scam and a hoax, and he vowed to take the United States out of the Paris accord, a global effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions and the warming they cause.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the election, the president-elect has changed his tune, telling Fox News Sunday that he is &quot;open-minded&quot; about the Paris agreement, and that he had &quot;good meetings&quot; recently with climate activists Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are encouraging words for the two-thirds of Americans rightfully worried about global warming. But there seems to be a disconnect between those words and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> actions in putting forth a slate of climate change skeptics for key administration jobs:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most troubling among them is Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma attorney general and fossil fuel industry ally, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt has sued the EPA -- unsuccessfully more often than not -- to block federal efforts to limit the poisons flowing from power plants, reduce smog, protect waterways, and cut climate-harmful methane. Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune compares putting Pruitt at the EPA to &quot;putting an arsonist in charge of fighting fires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> architect for EPA transition is Myron Ebell, director of a Washington think tank funded by coal and oil interests and a noted global warming skeptic. Ebell has accused  scientists of &quot;manipulating and falsifying the data&quot; on climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect's consideration for Interior secretary is Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash. A strong opponent of greenhouse gas regulations, she once said that Gore &quot;deserves an 'F' in science and an 'A' in creative writing.&quot; If approved as Interior secretary, Rodgers would oversee energy policy on a half-a-billion acres of public land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leading contender for secretary of State is Rex Tillerson, chief executive of energy giant ExxonMobil. Tillerson, to his credit, acknowledges that climate change is a threat and supports a carbon tax. But given his background, it's hard to imagine Tillerson promoting a transition away from fossil fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Pyle, a former Koch Industries lobbyist who is handling the transition at the Energy Department, authored a wish list for rolling back Obama administration climate initiatives: pulling out of the Paris accord; increasing energy production on federal lands; canceling President Obama's Clean Power Plan; and scaling back vehicle emission standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. leadership on climate issues is vital because America is second only to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. More than 190 countries signed the Paris accord, and if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pulls the U.S. out, other nations discouraged by America's action might leave as well, vastly increasing the odds of highly dangerous warming with rising seas, growing drought and severe weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On climate change issues, it's important to watch not just what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says, but also what he and his appointees do. Nothing less than the future of the planet could depend on it. <BR></SPAN></P>
