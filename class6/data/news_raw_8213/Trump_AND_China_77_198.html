<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Monday offered more of his economic vision, but with few particulars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did tweak the dramatic tax cuts he proposed months ago. He still wants to compress the current seven personal income tax brackets to three. But the rates  have been raised to 12%, 25% and 33%, from 10%, 20% and 25%.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change appears partly aimed at critics that say the overhaul will increase the U.S. deficit by $9.5 trillion over 10 years. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also proposed a new tax credit for child care expenses that could offset any savings, says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's analytics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reiterated his plan to slash the current 35% corporate tax rate to 15% and chop taxes for small businesses -- which mostly pay personal tax rates -- to 15% as well,  transforming the country from the highest-taxed nation to among the lowest. That should prompt more multinational companies to locate in the U.S. Zandi estimates all the cuts would juice the economy initially, spurring growth of 3.7% in 2017, compared to 3% under current law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to jump-start America,&quot; he said in a speech on his economic plan at the Detroit Economic Club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did little to explain how the tax reductions would be offset other than suggesting less taxed consumers and businesses will spend and invest more, creating a more vibrant economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plan to work, substantial spending cuts likely will be necessary, and the billionaire made no mention of that. As a result, both Moody's and Oxford project the plan would trigger massive deficits and sharply higher interest rates that lead to a recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On trade, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to brand </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a currency manipulator, stop the country from stealing U.S. intellectual property and force its government to no longer subsidize its exports. Previously, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he would slap </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with 45% tariffs if the country doesn't change its practices  as part of an effort to close the trade gap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tariffs on other countries' imports likely will cause them to retaliate with hefty duties on U.S. products, hammering U.S. exports and shrinking the economy. It's unlikely that low-level manufacturing jobs in sectors such as apparel that have shifted overseas will come streaming back while the country's trade policy remains uncertain, Zandi says. More likely is that the jobs will move to other low-wage countries such as Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he will release more details in coming weeks. <BR></SPAN></P>
