<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told factory workers near Detroit on Thursday that her economic plan will bring jobs back to the American heartland, while her opponent Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was offering nothing but a pessimistic view of America as a failed Third World state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her speech at Futuramic Tool &amp; Engineering in suburban Warren, Mich., Clinton tried to paint a stark contrast with the plan offered Monday by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the Detroit Economic Club.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blasting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for what she called his pessimistic view of America, she told the crowd, &quot;There is nothing we can't do if we do it together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrasting her own  message with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, she said, &quot;He is missing so much about what makes Michigan great. He describes America as an embarrassment. He says we're becoming a Third World country. Look around you, my friends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton also addressed trade, an issue on which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has criticized her for supporting deals that cost American jobs. Promising to get tough with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and any other nation that tries to &quot;game the system&quot; or kill American jobs, Clinton said she would impose tariffs on trade cheaters and appoint the first &quot;chief trade prosecutor&quot; to enforce trade regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying America's best days are still ahead, she told the crowd, &quot;This is personal for me,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm a product of the middle class.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade rhetoric, Clinton said, &quot;His approach is based on fear, not strength.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also drew an Olympics analogy: &quot;If Team USA was as fearful as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Michael Phelps and Simone Biles would be cowering in the locker room, afraid to come out and compete. Instead, they're winning gold medals,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rattling off a host of ideas, she said she wanted broadband Internet service in every home, paid family leave, a higher federal minimum wage, clean water in Flint, initiatives for small business and entrepreneurs and a program to modernize infrastructure. She also said she wanted students to be able to refinance their student debt at affordable rates, and she hopes to boost community college training programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she will work to put Americans to work building and modernizing roads, airports, bridges and ports. &quot;We are way overdue for this,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign, in a series of email responses to Clinton's remarks, slammed the Democratic presidential nominee and what it called her &quot;failed economic agenda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now the American economy is only working for the rigged system in Washington and on Wall Street, yet Hillary Clinton is running to keep things as they are,&quot; said Dan Kowalski, deputy national policy director for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in a statement. &quot;Clinton's plans today will short circuit our economy by raising taxes, increasing spending and killing jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before her speech, Clinton toured the Futuramic plant with owner Mark Jurcak and met with employees who are making rocket boosters for NASA and parts for the F-35 fighter jet. She asked about the materials used in the components and talked with employees about their training and background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Warren company has a working apprenticeship partnership with Macomb Community College to train the workers in advanced manufacturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was told about the absolute perfection that is required to do this work,&quot; Clinton told the crowd. &quot;What is happening here can happen in so many places if we put our mind to it and support advanced manufacturing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
