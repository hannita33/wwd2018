<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate steady Wednesday and left the door open to a December rate hike amid an improving economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement after a two-day meeting, the Fed said it decided to keep its federal funds rate at a historically low 0.4%.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed said &quot;the case for a rate increase strengthened,&quot; but policymakers decided, &quot;for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That largely mirrored the September statement, except the Fed added that only &quot;some&quot; advances are needed, suggesting a rate hike may be at hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement added that &quot;inflation has increased somewhat since earlier this year&quot; and removed its previous assertion that &quot;inflation is expected to remain low in the near term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed's preferred measure of annual inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, is still below its 2% annual target, but it has edged up steadily this year, reaching 1.7% recently. That could pave the way for a rate hike as soon as December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stocks, already on pace for a seventh day of losses, fell further after the statement but shortly began staging a recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some economists said the Fed was unlikely to send an explicit signal of a December rate increase similar to a reference in October 2015 to a possible hike at the &quot;next meeting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With markets already pricing in an increase anyway, Fed officials would prefer not to close off their options, economists said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Absent substantial shocks, they're set on December,&quot; says UBS economist Drew Matus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among potential shocks are a contested presidential election next week or a victory by Republican Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that roils markets, economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Wednesday's statement was released, fed fund futures reckoned there was a 72% chance the Fed will lift its benchmark rate at a Dec. 13-14 meeting, up from 68% a day earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unlikely the Fed would act just days before the election, potentially disrupting markets and coloring perceptions of the economy and presidential candidates </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fed has stood pat since raising its federal funds rate in December for the first time in nine years, citing factors such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic slowdown, the United Kingdom's Brexit vote,  volatile markets and a spring slump in U.S. job growth. <BR></SPAN></P>
