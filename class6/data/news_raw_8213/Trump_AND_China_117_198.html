<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps nowhere has the Republican Party's accommodation of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> been more awkward and more shameless than on the issue of trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> again denounced the North American Free Trade Agreement as &quot;the worst economic deal in the history of our country&quot; and &quot;a horror show&quot; -- all while introducing his NAFTA-backing running mate, Mike Pence. And on Monday, the GOP convention in Cleveland approved a platform that reads like a criminal indictment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic practices and is considerably more hostile to trade than the one adopted four years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republican leaders in Congress have already given up on scheduling a vote this year on the 12-nation trade pact known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which excludes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and would help American movie makers, software designers, drug companies and other industries that benefit from international commerce. The party platform says TPP approval shouldn't be rushed or undertaken in a lame duck Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a message no doubt goes down well in hard-hit Rust Belt communities where the presidential election will be contested. In recent decades, certain manufacturing industries, such as textiles, have contracted severely, and most government programs to retrain displaced workers have been a shambles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, a message that focuses only on the casualties of trade is misleading and manipulative. It is a bad idea for a party that has long branded itself as the party of free enterprise. It is even worse news for the nation as a whole. Trade is a major force behind innovation and improvements in quality that help keep the American economy on its toes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without competition from Japan, Detroit would probably still be making the shoddy cars that were its hallmark in the 1970s. And without the ability to sell globally, companies such as Apple, Facebook and Google would probably not be the iconic brands they are today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade gets a bad rap -- from progressive Democrats as well </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> backers -- because its benefits are taken for granted, its beneficiaries are hard to identify and organize, and its victims are readily recognizable when a plant closes. But its upsides include lower costs and more choices for consumers, and thriving exports in agriculture, technology, health care, financial services and even many areas of manufacturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A strong case can be made that technology, and not trade, is the major disruptive force (for good and bad) in employment. This can be seen in the fact that manufacturing output has continued to grow even as 5 million manufacturing jobs have been eliminated since 2000. It can also be seen in the declines in employment in retail, travel, media and other industries not impacted by trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, to hear </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> talk, one would think that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mexico and a few other countries are responsible for all disruptions in the workforce, and that Americans get nothing out of trade. If the GOP seeks a vibrant future -- for itself and for the U.S. economy -- it will turn away from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> defeatist trade policies. <BR></SPAN></P>
