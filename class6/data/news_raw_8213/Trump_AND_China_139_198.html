<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decried the state of the nation's nuclear arsenal Thursday, saying in a tweet that it had to be strengthened &quot;greatly&quot; during uncertain times.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes,&quot; he tweeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made his remarks a day after receiving a national security briefing from a group of mostly senior military officers, including Air Force Lt. Gen. Jack Weinstein, deputy chief of staff for strategic deterrence and nuclear integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nuclear arms reduction expert reacted with alarm to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweet. Joseph Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, said similar statements by Russian President Vladimir Putin could trigger a destabilizing nuclear arms race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States and Russia have 95% of the world's nuclear weapons, but smaller nuclear powers, such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> North Korea, India and Pakistan, may view their statements as a call to bolster their own arsenals, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the two guys with the biggest arsenals are talking about expanding, they're sending a message ... that it's time to start their engines,&quot; Cirincione said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An alternative, he said, would be for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Putin to establish a relationship in which arms reduction is a centerpiece. &quot;He could assure his place in the history books with the deal of a lifetime,&quot; Cirincione said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its 2017 budget, the Pentagon has several initiatives designed to modernize its nuclear arsenal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them is a $2.1 billion program to develop a radar-evading, long-range bomber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report in 2015, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that Obama administration plans to modernize nuclear forces would cost nearly $350 billion over 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. David Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, has emphasized the importance of the service's nuclear mission during a trip this week to U.S. air bases. He said the Air Force's top priority is maintaining a safe, secure and effective nuclear enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world has seen a dramatic reduction in the number of nuclear weapons in the past 25 years, Pentagon records show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1991, Pentagon data show, more than 7,600 nuclear warheads have been deactivated, while the United States, Russia and former Soviet republics have destroyed more than 3,600 missiles and launchers, 33 submarines, 155 bombers, more than 1.6 million chemical munitions and more than 4,000 metric tons of chemical weapons. <BR></SPAN></P>
