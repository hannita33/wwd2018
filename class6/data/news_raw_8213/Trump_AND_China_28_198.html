<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a forceful argument Tuesday for globalization and pushed back against talk of protectionism that was a hallmark of President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic policy during his campaign.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No one will emerge as a winner in a trade war,&quot; he said at the World Economic Forum before a crowd of 1,250 global leaders and CEOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people blame economic globalization for what has gone wrong in our world,&quot; Xi said. &quot;It is true that economic globalization has created new problems, but this is no justification to write off economic globalization all together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xi's attendance at the annual gathering for business leaders and the international elite comes as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has sought to present itself as a force for stability after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election and the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union. Both of those events were perceived as victories for anti-establishment forces. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has threatened to slap tariffs on some foreign-made goods and sanction </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for manipulating its currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xi, the first Chinese head of state to visit the forum, did not mention </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by name, but he addressed many of the trade and economic issues </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> raised during his  campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Say no to protectionism,&quot; Xi said. &quot;It is like locking yourself in a dark room. Wind and rain are kept out, but so are light and air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xi said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would keep its door &quot;wide open&quot; to free trade and would not start a trade war by devaluing its currency. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contributed 39% to world economic growth in 2016, an increase of 14.2 percentage points from 2015, according to the International Monetary Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speech was loaded with Chinese proverbs, American expressions and mixed metaphors. In committing to sustainable development, Xi said, &quot;We know only too well that there is no such thing as a free lunch in the world and that no pie will fall from the sky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xi also invoked the words of President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, which he had seen with President Obama during a state visit to the U.S. in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No country should view its development path on its own,&quot; Xi said. &quot;Development is of the people, by the people and for the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Scaramucci, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition aide and the only member of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> team to attend the forum, said the administration wants to work with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;We want to have a phenomenal relationship with the Chinese, but if they really believe in globalization and the words of Lincoln, then we need to find a way to get more symmetry in trade deals,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IHS Markit chief economist Nariman Behravesh said Xi's remarks on opening up </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to more imports and direct foreign investment were encouraging but should be viewed with caution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actions speak louder than words. A lot will depend on what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does,&quot; Behravesh said. &quot;This is a good set of commitments on his part. It is encouraging, but we will see what the follow through is.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
