<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Hillary Clinton vied for the title of commander in chief Wednesday, each touting their own experience and saying the other lacks the judgment and temperament to lead the nation's armed forces in perilous times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a &quot;Commander in Chief Forum&quot; sponsored by NBC News, Clinton, a former secretary of State, stressed her support of the raid in 2011 that killed 9/11 plotter Osama bin Laden. She said she has the essential quality for the job of president: &quot;steadiness -- an absolute rock steadiness &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former first lady and U.S. senator said it was &quot;a mistake&quot; to use private email while at the State Department, but she denied that she mishandled classified information.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, appearing after Clinton at the NBC/MSNBC forum, cited problems in the Middle East, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and elsewhere that he blamed on the policies of President Obama and Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need change,&quot; the New York businessman said, arguing that he will bring a &quot;common-sense&quot; approach to the demands of being commander in chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a national security speech earlier in the day, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attacked Clinton for her support of military action in Iraq and Libya, saying, &quot;She's trigger-happy and very unstable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the forum, Clinton called her vote in favor of the Iraq War a mistake, but she noted that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also initially supported the invasion in 2003 and has shifted his position in the years since. &quot;I have taken responsibility for my decision,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;He refuses to take responsibility for his support. ... That is a judgment issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told the forum he was &quot;totally against the war in Iraq&quot; because it destabilized the Middle East. &quot;I have good judgment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC News moderator Matt Lauer asked the candidates to discuss their own ideas and refrain from attacking their opponent, a request not always honored. The candidates took questions from veterans invited to participate in the forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said praise from Russian President Vladimir Putin would not affect his policy toward Russia. He said Putin has &quot;been a leader far more than our president has been a leader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech earlier Wednesday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proclaimed a goal of &quot;Peace Through Strength.&quot; He told an invited crowd at Philadelphia's Union League club that he wants a foreign policy &quot;focused on advancing America's core national interests -- so important -- promoting regional stability and ... easing the tensions within our very troubled world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton unveiled a list of endorsements from 95 retired generals and admirals -- most of whom had previously announced their support  -- who cited her years as secretary of State and as a U.S. senator in contrast to the New York businessman who lacks experience in government and has attacked global allies as well as adversaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton &quot;is the only candidate that has the experience, temperament, critical thinking and level-headed leadership to keep America safe and our partnerships strong,&quot; retired Air Force general Lloyd Newton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton communication director Jennifer Palmieri said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is reduced to &quot;taunts and insults&quot; because he cannot defend his own record. &quot;You could dismiss these actions as insecure schoolyard behavior, but this man is running to be president of the United States,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cited his own endorsements from 88 generals and admirals Tuesday.  Wednesday, he called for increased defense spending and an end to the automatic series of congressional budget cuts known as sequestration. He said that would permit the financing of more submarines, ships and troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GOP candidate did not supply an overall cost estimate for his plans, though he said &quot;budget reforms&quot; and the collection of unpaid taxes would help finance them. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget reported that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans would cost $150 billion, even if his cost offsets materialized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinton campaign released an ad this week showing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> making remarks viewed by some as disparaging toward the military, including an attack on Arizona Sen. John McCain, a former Vietnam prisoner of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rucker Culpepper, who runs Clinton's get-out-the-vote effort for military veterans' families, said, &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been disrespecting our veterans and military for decades, proving he's unqualified and temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
