<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the nation nears full employment --  a sort of finish line for the jobs recovery -- many of the factory towns hit hardest in the Great Recession are already there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven of the 10 metro areas with the highest concentrations of manufacturing jobs had unemployment rates below the 4.7% U.S. rate in May, the latest local data available, according to the Labor Department, Wells Fargo and Moody's Analytics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buffeted by automation and foreign imports, employment in communities such as Hickory, N.C., and Dalton, Ga., are likely to remain well below pre-recession levels. But at least the towns are growing jobs again, including in factories buoyed by the housing and auto recoveries, and trying to diversify their industrial bases. Manufacturers are competing  against cheaper imports by automating some functions and providing better quality and service.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some cases,  low unemployment rates are at least partly byproducts of smaller labor forces after many laid-off workers retired or moved to cities with better  opportunities, reducing the number of jobless residents. Still, they signify a measure of stability and  return to gradual job growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Small factory towns seem to be making their peace with globalization and technology,&quot; Wells Fargo economist Mark Vitner says. That's no small achievement for communities that rely so heavily on one or two sectors, says Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it comes against the backdrop of a  vitriolic presidential campaign in which Republican Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says trade deals have ravaged many factory towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hickory area, a  furniture-making hub and large producer of textiles and fiber-optic cables, had a 4.9% jobless rate in May, down from nearly 15% in 2009. It lost 20,000 jobs in the 2001 recession amid a flood of imports and the fiber glut, and 18,000 more in the Great Recession. About  5,000 jobs have come back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams-Sonoma, which makes sofas and chairs at a 600-worker plant there, delivers custom-made pieces to its Pottery Barn and other  stores about a month after the order is placed, compared with about three months for Chinese imports, giving it a leg up, says Darryl Webster,  vice president of upholstery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the housing recovery has bolstered sales. But with the Hickory area's labor force -- the number of people working and looking for jobs -- 5% smaller than in early 2010, finding skilled workers is a struggle. Webster says he has been trying to fill 50 job openings for several months, forcing him to offer new hires $1,500 signing bonuses.  Many young adults leave for college in bigger cities, such as Raleigh, and don't come back, says Daniel Hearn, CEO of the Catawba County Chamber of Commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another town benefiting  from the housing recovery is Dalton, which calls itself the world's carpet capital. It was devastated in the housing crash. Unemployment, which topped 10% as recently as 2013, now is  5.7%, in part because of a shrunken labor force. Still, payrolls, more than a third of which are factory jobs, are up 9% the past three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To survive,  companies have automated and employ fewer workers, says Carl Campbell, head of economic development for the Dalton-Whitfield County Joint Development Authority. Officials, he says, are also recruiting other industries, such as autos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moody's economist Alex Lowy calls Dalton the country's &quot;least industrially diverse metro area,&quot; making it tough to attract skilled workers. But Campbell says local employers can draw from nearby big cities, such as Chattanooga, Tenn., about 30 miles away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, factory towns riding the housing and auto recoveries face risks. The jobless rate in auto haven Kokomo, Ind., is 4.9%, down from 17% in 2009. But the vehicle market has peaked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a concern,&quot; says Mike McCool of the Greater Kokomo Economic Development Alliance. <BR></SPAN></P>
