<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America needs a functional working relationship with Russia. Hillary Clinton understands its importance, having attempted to &quot;reset&quot; relations at the beginning of her tenure as secretary of State.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As late as June 2013, Clinton reportedly told a private audience that she &quot;would love it if we could continue to build a more positive relationship with Russia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agrees, but his reasoning is perhaps clearer than Clinton's. He views the world through the lens of foreign policy realism -- the belief that nation-states remain dominant in the global system, and countries seek to pursue their own national interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> argues that America should develop a foreign policy that recognizes and addresses the most direct threat to our security. He contends that the Islamic State terrorist group, having openly declared its intention to attack the USA, must be dealt with immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout history, nations have often understood that the enemy of our enemy is our friend. As the United States allied with the Soviet Union to defeat Nazi Germany, Washington should seek similar cooperation with Moscow to defeat ISIL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese expansionism and militarization, as witnessed in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, could also shape </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Russia policy. He understands that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, given its economic prowess, is emerging as a superpower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has warned, &quot;Don't ever let </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Russia get together.&quot; Pursuing policies that increase the probability of a Sino-Russian alliance are reckless and potentially place America in grave danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, there is much noise surrounding </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Russia policy, the vast majority of which is partisan chatter. When our national interests are considered through the lens of common sense, the current dangerous level of hostility between the United States and Russia -- as evidenced by Mr. Putin's recent nuclear saber rattling -- is not justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> instincts to avoid a massive divergence of interests with Russia are correct. Given the geopolitical stakes, it's certainly worth a try.</SPAN></P>
