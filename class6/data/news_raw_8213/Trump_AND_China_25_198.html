<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was quite a year. We said hello to President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. We said goodbye to Prince, Muhammad Ali and John Glenn. We saw the power of peaceful protest at Standing Rock. And we saw the power of hate and gun violence, once again, this time at a gay nightclub in Orlando. We listened as an anonymous survivor of a sexual assault by a Stanford swimmer changed the national conversation on rape. We witnessed history as the first Latina was elected to the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was unspeakable loss and times that affirmed our faith in America. As 2016 comes to a close, USA TODAY revisits one story from each state -- the big news, the best investigations and the moments we can't stop talking about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alabama</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNPARALLELED LOSS IN STATE'S 'LITERARY CAPITAL'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harper Lee, among America's  most influential authors, died Feb. 19 in her  hometown,  Monroeville, Ala. To Kill a Mockingbird -- about a lawyer who defends a black man falsely accused of rape in the Jim Crow South -- won the 1961 Pulitzer Prize, sold more than 30million copies in English, is taught in schools  and has inspired artists from Truman Capote to Taylor Swift. &quot;What that one story did, more powerfully than 100 speeches possibly could, was change the way we saw each other and then the way we saw ourselves. Through the uncorrupted eyes of a child, she showed us the beautiful complexity of our common humanity and the importance of striving for justice,&quot; President Obama said in awarding  Lee a National Medal of the Arts in 2011. Mockingbird was her  only novel until 2015's Go Set a Watchman, which, despite tepid reviews, reaffirmed her as a stalwart anti-racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALASKA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHERE CLIMATE CHANGE IS A DAILY REALITY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alaska was so warm this year, snow was shipped in for the Iditarod sled dog race, ice melt forced polar bears into the paths of schoolchildren, and the state saw its biggest landslide in decades, partly due to retreating glaciers. Here, climate change is not abstract -- especially in the state's western corner, where people's relationship with nature is a matter of life and death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARIZONA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHERIFF ENDS YEAR WITH A BANG -- OR WHIMPER?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheriff Joe Arpaio, aka &quot;America's toughest sheriff,&quot; was criminally charged with contempt of court in October. In November, he lost his election, defeated after 24 years in office. Known nationally for immigration crackdowns and racial profiling, advocates for migrants celebrated. &quot;Sheriff Arpaio didn't lose by coincidence; he was taken down by the people he hunted,&quot; Carlos Garcia said. Not one to leave quietly, Arpaio renewed his claim Dec. 15 that President Obama's birth certificate was forged (a theory  debunked by fact-checkers and ultimately  abandoned by  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arkansas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE DUGGARS ARE STILL COUNTING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TLC may have pulled the plug in 2015 on its hit series 19 Kids and Counting after  the revelation Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar's son, Josh, sexually molested five young girls, including his own sisters, but in 2016, the Duggar family still made headlines. This year: Jinger Duggar married soccer player Jeremy Vuolo. Jessa and husband, Ben Seewald, announced they're expecting a  second child. So did Jill. And Josh Duggar got out of rehab and returned to Arkansas, months after he'd checked into a &quot;faith-based&quot; facility in Illinois.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">California</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHANGING  DISCOURSE ON SEXUAL ASSAULT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her words were raw and excruciating. &quot;You don't know me, but you've been inside me, and that's why we're here today,&quot; said Emily Doe, the anonymous victim of a sexual assault in 2015 by Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner. The powerful impact statement she read in court gave voice to sexual assault victims and forced the nation to have an important conversation about rape culture. Turner, who assaulted Doe near a trash bin while she was unconscious, was sentenced to six months in prison, a seemingly lenient punishment that drew national outrage. He  served only three months. In the aftermath of the case, California passed a law requiring longer sentences to be served in state prison for defendants convicted of assaulting unconscious victims. Doe was named one of Glamour magazine's 2016 Women of the Year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PEYTON MANNING SAYS GOODBYE TO THE NFL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Future Hall of Famer Peyton Manning capped  an  18-year career by winning Super Bowl 50 in his final NFL game -- propelling the Denver Broncos to a 24-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers. Like Broncos president and former Denver QB John Elway, Manning retired  as a champion. He became the oldest quarterback to start a Super Bowl and the first to win Super Bowls with multiple franchises.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GUN VIOLENCE AD WITH A  TWIST GOES VIRAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gun violence can be stopped if you know what to look for. That's the message of the ad  &quot;Evan,&quot; which went viral this year. A  folk song sets the tone for a romance that unfolds with expert pacing. Then it  comes to a shattering halt. The spot is from the Sandy Hook Promise, a non-partisan, non-profit group launched by families who lost loved ones four years ago in Newtown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delaware</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOE BIDEN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020? POSSIBLY, MAYBE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe Biden, a former Delaware senator and  two-term vice president, said he's not ruling out anything -- including a run for the White House -- as Democrats look to the future after a stinging election. Biden ran for president in 1988 and 2008. In announcing his decision not to run for 2016, a grieving Biden, whose son, Beau, died of brain cancer at age 46 in 2015, said the country needed &quot;a moonshot&quot; to cure cancer. President Obama put him in charge of that initiative in January.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFTER PULSE SHOOTING, WE MOURN THE VICTIMS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar Mateen's voice went from emotionless to frenzied, speaking with police negotiators  June 12. Referencing U.S. airstrikes in the Middle East, Mateen, 29, of Fort Pierce  killed 49 and left dozens injured at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, in one of the deadliest shooting rampages  in U.S. history. He was killed after a three-hour standoff. After initial plans to turn Pulse into a  memorial, owners recently decided to keep the LGBT club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Georgia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAD IN 'HOT CAR' CASE GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors said he knew his 22-month-old son sweltered in a hot car for seven hours. The jury agreed. Justin Ross Harris was found guilty in November on all charges in the  death of son Cooper in 2014. Prosecutors argued  that Harris wanted to live a child-free life. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole plus 32 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hawaii</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">75 YEARS AFTER ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than seven decades after Japanese forces struck the heart of the  Navy's Pacific Fleet in a fiery ambush at Pearl Harbor, thousands of veterans, military officials, dignitaries and a dwindling number of survivors gathered there Dec. 7 to remember the dead and the start of a war that changed the world.  Pearl Harbor gave birth to the &quot;Greatest Generation,&quot; said Tom Brokaw. Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe toured the site with President Obama, marking the first formal visit by a Japanese leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Idaho</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO'S TEACHING THE CHILDREN?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We trust them with our kids, but what don't we know about teachers' troubled pasts? A USA TODAY Network investigation found flaws in the nation's fractured systems for checking teachers' backgrounds. Several teachers have left or been removed from positions after misconduct came to light, including Idaho high school teacher James P. Verity. Verity lost his teaching license in Oregon over allegations of a sexually charged relationship with an 18-year-old student but found a fresh start teaching  in neighboring Idaho. The  investigation prompted a state-by-state audit of a privately run database of disciplined teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illinois</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHICAGO HITS GRIM MILESTONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gun violence defies comprehension in Chicago. In 2016, the nation's third-largest city surpassed 700 murders. There is no shortage of maladies plaguing Chicago. It is mired in billions of dollars of debt, unemployment for young black men hovers just below 50%, and Chicago's African-American population has plummeted by nearly 200,000 since 2000 as the black middle class has looked for greener -- and safer -- pastures. The city blames the violence on a combination of increased gang activity and weak gun laws, but anti-violence activists point to a lack of economic opportunity. Diane Latiker, who heads the Chicago organization Kids Off the Block, said, &quot;Chicago has long been one of a Tale of Two Cities. Nothing has changed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indiana</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USA GYMNASTICS ENABLED SEX PREDATORS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of sexual misconduct by coaches has haunted USA Gymnastics for decades, but an  investigation by The Indianapolis Star  revealed the organization's  policies enabled predatory coaches to continue working with children, despite warnings of misconduct. At least 368 gymnasts have alleged some form of sexual abuse at the hands of their coaches, gym owners and other adults working in gymnastics. And it's likely an undercount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iowa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOV. BRANSTAD HEADING TO </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CHINA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He helped deliver Iowa's electoral votes to Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.  Gov. Terry Branstad will serve the new administration as U.S. ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Branstad  has known Chinese President Xi Jinping since 1985, when Xi visited Iowa on an agricultural mission, and considers him &quot;an old friend.&quot; He's conducted numerous trade missions to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to promote Iowa agriculture products. Branstad, 70, is the longest-serving governor in U.S. history, serving four terms from 1983 to 1999 and a term and a half since 2011.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kansas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOY DIES ON  WORLD'S TALLEST WATERSLIDE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was called Verr&uuml;ckt, the German word for crazy or insane. At 168 feet high, it was taller than Niagara Falls and the Statue of Liberty. Officials announced the ride would be demolished after  the death of Caleb Schwab, 10,  son of Rep. Scott Schwab. Caleb died from a fatal neck injury  suffered on the ride in August at the Schlitterbahn Water Park in Kansas City. The ride propelled rafts with two to three riders at speeds of up to 65 mph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kentucky</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOODBYE TO THE GREATEST, MUHAMMAD ALI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world mourned when boxing legend and Louisville native Muhammad Ali died June 3 at  age  74. Ali was an Olympic gold medalist and three-time heavyweight champion,  but he was so much more. His flair in the ring (&quot;Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee!&quot;) and genius for trash talking (&quot;I'm so mean, I make medicine sick&quot;) won him worldwide celebrity. At the height of his fame, he became a leading civil rights and anti-war voice. His opposition to the Vietnam War in 1967 cost him the belt and led to a three-year ban from boxing. After retiring, Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1984. Even in illness, Ali was an inspiration, his trembling hands lighting the Olympic torch for the 1996 Atlanta Games. His Louisville funeral was attended by thousands, including former president Bill Clinton, who saluted him as a &quot;universal soldier for humanity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louisiana</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEY, REMEMBER US?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While America descended from its  Olympics high and focused on the  presidential election, Louisianans were fighting for survival. In August, the Southern state experienced  flooding so horrific that the Red Cross called it the worst natural disaster since Superstorm  Sandy. About 40,000 homes and 13 lives were lost.  The lack of national interest in the flood could be because Americans are becoming numb to the onslaught of human suffering. &quot;There is a bit of disaster fatigue,&quot; says Susan Moeller, professor of media and international affairs at the University of Maryland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CANNABIS CHRISTMAS? NOT YET, MAINERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although  Maine narrowly voted in favor of legalizing marijuana in November, those opposing the measure aimed to snuff out the flame. If a recount, which could take until January, upholds passage, Maine will follow  Massachusetts to  become the second Northeastern state to legalize marijuana. The law would allow adults to have up to six mature plants, 12 immature plants and an unlimited number of seedlings without a state license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Massachusetts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAVID ORTIZ, BOSTON'S GREATEST BALL PLAYER, IS OUT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He didn't go out the way he wanted: David Ortiz, the 6-foot-3 Red Sox slugger from the Dominican Republic, ended his 20-year career in a sweep to the Cleveland Indians in October. It wasn't long, though, before chants of &quot;Thank you, Papi,&quot; began, and Ortiz saluted the city he came to embody. After joining the Red Sox in 2003, Ortiz brought three World Series rings to Boston in nine years, including its first in eight decades. He became the city's voice, delivering a defiant, legendary speech in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing. He'll go down as one of the greatest Red Sox players of all time -- perhaps the most important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michigan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12 MONTHS LATER, FLINT'S WATER REMAINS  UNSAFE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama declared a state of emergency in Flint, Mich., in January, but the city's water still isn't safe to drink without  a filter. Lead levels spiked after the city swapped water suppliers in 2014. The state skipped necessary anti-corrosion treatments, letting lead leach from miles of old service pipes into residents' taps. Everyone who drank the city's tap water was exposed, including as many as 8,657 children, Census data showed. The harmful impacts are considered most severe on young brains and nervous systems. In one of its last votes of the year, Congress approved legislation worth more than $120 million to deal with the  crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minnesota</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GENRE-DEFYING ICON PRINCE IS GONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When music legend Prince died in April, it seemed as though the whole world stopped to mourn. The pop icon blended funk and rock with his own fierce individualism, winning seven Grammys, one Oscar and a spot in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. His body was found in an elevator at his estate in suburban Minneapolis. The cause: an accidental, self-inflicted overdose of a painkiller. The singer didn't have a will, leaving the fate of his fortune to play out in court.  Fans celebrated the sassy prodigy who created Purple Rain, Let's Go Crazy and When Doves Cry -- all on a single album. Prince album sales rose 11,500% the week after his death, per Nielsen data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mississippi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHOCKING ACT OF RACISM BY STUDENTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a story one could hardly believe was written in 2016. One or more white students placed a noose around the neck of a black football player at the Stone High School in Wiggins, a small town near Biloxi. The NAACP said the  incident happened in October during a break in football practice, and the noose was &quot;yanked backward&quot; while on the student's neck. &quot;This is 2016, not 1916. This is America,&quot; said Mississippi NAACP President Derrick Johnson. Days later, a student was disciplined, according to the school district's lawyer, who could not name the student or the specific punishment, citing privacy rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missouri</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RAMS FANS FURIOUS AS TEAM LEAVES ST. LOUIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 21 years in St. Louis, Rams fans learned in January their beloved franchise officially would move back to Los Angeles. Builders broke ground on Rams owner Stan Kroenke's $2.6billion Inglewood stadium project in November. It will include an entertainment, retail and office development covering nearly 300 acres near the L.A. airport. &quot;I think this is going to be one of the greatest complexes in the world,&quot; NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said of the Inglewood plan.  The Rams are 4-10 and recently fired coach Jeff Fisher.  That seems to be OK with some locals. &quot;Whoever they play, I'm rooting against them,&quot; St. Louis-area resident Peter Mueller, 22, said as he watched the L.A. Rams in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montana</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RYAN ZINKE FOR INTERIOR SECRETARY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nominated Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke to lead the Interior Department in December, saying the former Navy SEAL strikes the right balance between protecting the nation's natural resources and overly onerous federal regulations. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, &quot;America is the most beautiful country in the world, and he is going to help keep it that way with smart management of our federal lands.&quot; Zinke said he is honored by the nomination, describing himself &quot;as someone who grew up in a logging and rail town and hiking in Glacier National Park.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nebraska</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAMILY VACATION TURNS INTO NIGHTMARE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The horrific death of Lane Graves, a  Nebraska toddler killed after an alligator pulled him into a lagoon at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort in June, tugged on every parent's heartstrings. Matt and Melissa Graves were enjoying  vacation when a 7- to 8-foot gator  emerged from the man-made lake and grabbed Lane, 2, as he played in about a foot of water. A report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission found that the boy did not do anything to provoke the alligator -- in fact, the report highlighted how other park visitors alerted Disney employees about seeing gators in the area. Since the attack, Disney has posted additional warning signs around the park and built fences and other barriers around some waterfront areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevada</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WOMAN MAKES HISTORY IN THE SENATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto became the first woman to represent Nevada in the U.S. Senate -- and the first Latina in the chamber's history --  after defeating Republican Rep. Joe Heck in a tight race in November. The contest -- which brought in more than $90million in outside money -- keeps the seat in Democratic hands after Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid decided not to seek a sixth term after serving nearly 30 years in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Hampshire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEROIN AND OPIOID ABUSE WREAK HAVOC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In New Hampshire, the heroin and opiate epidemic is a public health crisis. &quot;I have never seen anything like this,&quot; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., said during an appearance  this year before the Senate Judiciary Committee. &quot;This is about real people dying.&quot; Although opioid and heroin addiction have earned the distinction as the greatest drug threat in the USA, the federal government's effort to counter it has been spotty. &quot;The biggest area where we have fallen short is filling the gap between people who need treatment and those able to get it,&quot; said Michael Botticelli, director of the National Drug Control Policy. White House officials are  moving quickly to get $500 million flowing into the hardest-hit areas since  President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act in December to tackle the public health crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maryland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZERO CONVICTIONS IN FREDDIE GRAY CASE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freddie Gray, 25, died of neck injuries  sustained while shackled and handcuffed without a seat belt in the back of a police car in April 2015. After Gray's funeral, protests broke out across the city, and rioting resulted in buildings burned to the ground. After Baltimore's medical examiner determined Gray's death was a homicide, many residents wanted the six indicted officers to pay.  Judge Barry Williams acquitted three of the officers, including the van's driver and the highest-ranking officer. On July 27,  charges against the three remaining officers accused in the death of Gray were dropped, bringing an end to a tumultuous criminal case with zero convictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Jersey</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AIDES GO DOWN FOR BRIDGEGATE SCANDAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two former associates of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took the fall for a politically motivated bridge shutdown that ensnared motorists in a massive traffic jam three years ago in Fort Lee. A jury found Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, guilty of charges tied to the George W. Bridge closure, which was considered payback after Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, refused to endorse the governor for re-election. During their six-week trial, the associates suggested Christie knew early on about the closure, which left motorists stranded and streets packed for five days. Baroni and Kelly are scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">TRUMP</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SETTLES  FOR $25 MILLION IN LAWSUIT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his presidential campaign, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vowed not to settle the class-action lawsuits against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University, saying, &quot;I don't want to settle cases when we're right.&quot; But on Nov. 18, a little more than a week after winning the election, the president-elect agreed to settle fraud cases involving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University for $25 million. The deal does not require </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to acknowledge wrongdoing.  The cases included a lawsuit by New York state and two class-action suits in California against the university, which promised to reveal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> real estate investing &quot;secrets&quot; to those who enrolled.  The New York attorney general's fraud lawsuit described the defunct university as a scam that lured aspiring real estate developers, requiring them to shell out up to $35,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Mexico</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAVAJO GIRL KIDNAPPED, MURDERED IN  DESERT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashlynne Mike, 11, and her brother Ian, 9, were near their home in Lower Fruitland on May 2 when a man lured them into his van. He drove them into the New Mexico desert where he molested Ashlynne and bludgeoned her to death with a tire iron. Ian, who was released, was found walking along Navajo Route 13. Ashlynne's family discovered her body the next morning in the desert. Suspect Tom Begaye Jr., who police said confessed, was charged with first-degree murder, felony murder, kidnapping resulting in death, two counts of aggravated sexual abuse resulting in death and two counts of kidnapping of a minor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'DID YOU SHOOT HIM?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a few frantic seconds, something tragic happened on what might  have been an ordinary weekday afternoon in Charlotte. Plainclothes officers intending to serve a warrant Sept. 20 on someone else at an apartment complex spotted a person with a gun, they said. They confronted Keith Lamont Scott as  he waited for his son's school bus, family and friends said. Scott's wife, coming from their nearby apartment, captured video footage, in which four shots can be heard. &quot;Did you shoot him?&quot; she demanded of officer Brent Vinson. Police and prosecutors said Vinson was justified in shooting because Scott threatened the officers with a gun, or  appeared to. Charlotte grappled with several nights of protests as another fatal police shooting sprang into the national consciousness.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STANDSTILL NEAR STANDING ROCK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Find another way. That's what government engineers said Dec. 4 to builders of the 1,172-mile Dakota Access pipeline project. It was a victory for demonstrators who had gathered since  spring to protest planned construction of the nearly complete oil pipe under a lake at the edge of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, about 30 miles south of Bismarck. The protest was the longest in recent history, as well as the largest gathering of Native Americans in modern times. Law enforcement officers used tear gas and  water cannons on the cold but determined crowds. Many of them lived in a sprawling camp of teepees, mobile homes and cars. Sioux protesters got support from people around the country, including veterans, who came in as reinforcements. But the dispute is not over: Pipeline builder Energy Transfer Partners said it doesn't want to reroute the segment and blasted the Obama administration. It's unclear whether things could change under the incoming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Glenn left Earth for a third and final time Dec. 8, when the Ohio-born, space-race hero died at 95. Glenn  was a decorated fighter pilot who flew scores of missions in World War II and the Korean War. As a test pilot, he set a transcontinental speed record. He was a CEO of Royal Crown Cola. He served four terms in the U.S. Senate, taking a spin as a presidential candidate in 1984. Not to mention the Cambridge-born, New Concord-raised nice guy  was the first American to orbit the planet, circling that big blue ball three times before his risky, dramatic re-entry in the Friendship 7 spacecraft Feb. 20, 1962. In 1998, he orbited Earth again in the space shuttle Discovery, becoming the oldest person ever in space, at 77. As a fellow, pioneering Mercury astronaut radioed on the Friendship mission in 1962, &quot;Godspeed, John Glenn.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oklahoma opened 2016 with a swarm of 70 small earthquakes in one week after jumping from two earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or higher in 2008 to 890 in 2015. In March, the U.S. Geological Survey released a report citing the oil and gas drilling process as the cause. The USGS blamed wastewater disposal, in which high-pressure water is injected into rock formations underground. Oil and gas companies argued that the vast majority of wells cause no problems. Despite depending on the industry for jobs and taxes, Oklahoma strengthened regulations, and the rate of quakes has declined. Lawsuits against several petroleum companies are pending over damage caused by the earthquakes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A TENSE, DEADLY STANDOFF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Jan. 2, a group of armed anti-government activists led by rancher Ammon Bundy, below, rang in the new year by seizing a federal building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. They said tough restrictions on grazing and other uses of federal land threaten their way of life. The ensuing standoff with authorities lasted more than a month. When Bundy and several others tried to leave the compound to attend a community meeting, law enforcement officials moved in. During the arrest, Robert &quot;Lavoy&quot; Finicum, the group's de facto spokesman, was fatally shot. Bundy, his brother  and five other leaders of the occupation were acquitted of conspiracy and weapons charges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A grand jury began investigating six Catholic dioceses after more than 50 priests or religious leaders were found to have abused children over a 40-year period in the Altoona-Johnstown Dioceses and two bishops helped cover it up. In August, the Diocese of Harrisburg acknowledged that 15 priests who had served the diocese had been accused of sexually abusing children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Penn State University is still dealing with the aftermath of Jerry Sandusky's trial, nearly five years after his indictment.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of women, girls and other supporters proudly donned yoga pants in October as they peacefully paraded around the Rhode Island neighborhood of a man who derided the attire as tacky and ridiculous in a letter to the editor published in the Barrington Times. &quot;They do nothing to compliment a women over 20 years old,&quot; Alan Sorrentino wrote. &quot;In fact, the look is bad. Do yourself a favor, grow up and stop wearing them in public.&quot; The letter backfired. Women from as far as Texas and Australia said they'd wear yoga pants in a show of solidarity. Parade organizer Jamie Burke said women are &quot;fed up with the policing of our wardrobes and our bodies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dylann Roof, a self-admitted white supremacist, was convicted in December of the deaths of nine African-American parishioners at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. After six days of testimony, a federal jury took less than two hours to find him guilty of all 33 counts lodged against him. Felicia Sanders, a survivor of the attack in June 2015, called the verdict &quot;music to my ears.&quot;  Roof, 22, will represent himself at sentencing, a move that strips his defense team of its decision-making powers. In January, the panel will deliberate on whether Roof faces a life sentence or the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONTROVERSY OVER URINE SAMPLE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People in South Dakota who refuse to cooperate with police for a urine sample may be forced to endure involuntary use of catheters. Though the practice isn't new, it has been criticized as invasive and a constitutional violation. Courtney Bowie, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, said the practice raises legal concerns. A man charged with felony drug ingestion asked a judge to throw out evidence in his case. He claimed his  rights were violated because he was subjected to an involuntary catheter, after police suspected drug use. Involuntary urine samples are permitted in South Dakota with a signed court order  but have been challenged in  Indiana and Utah.</SPAN></P>

The Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the resort town of Gatlinburg, Tenn., reopened to the public this month after devastating wildfires caused 14 deaths and damaged about 2,500 buildings. Prosecutors charged two teens with the blazes. The Sevier County fires came near the end of a disastrous year for fires in Tennessee, where 1,427 blazes have spanned 44,027 acres.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the loquacious leader of the Supreme Court's conservative bloc and a leading force in American life for three decades, was found dead at a Texas ranch in February, kicking off a fierce battle over the future of the high court. After Scalia died, Senate Republicans refused to consider President Obama's nomination of federal appeals court Judge Merrick Garland as a replacement, and the remaining justices deadlocked 4-4 in four cases. The court began hearing cases again in October but is stuck in a holding pattern until a new justice (picked by President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">) can be confirmed and seated.</SPAN></P>

He didn't. McMullin's unlikely surge in the state was a closely watched story line. The former CIA officer is Mormon and had taken on more traditional GOP stances than the party's standard-bearer. Had he locked down Utah, it would have been the first time since 1968 that a non-major-party candidate won a state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Animal rights group Compassion Over Killing captured  video from inside several Tyson Foods facilities in Virginia of workers stomping, kicking and suffocating breeder chickens. In one of the videos, released in August, a  worker warned the undercover investigator that &quot;you can't let nobody see you do that&quot; as he stepped on a chicken's head, suffocating it. &quot;You don't know if he's working for the animal rights,&quot; he said.  Workers seen in the videos were fired, and all live-poultry workers were retrained on the company's animal welfare policies, according to Tyson.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amazon -- the company that made leaving your house to shop optional -- has made leaving your wallet at home optional, too. At least at its brick-and-mortar store in Seattle,  which has neither cashiers nor self-checkout lines. How it works: Shoppers tap their phone at a sensor by the store's entrance and are identified by a camera. As they browse, cameras, microphones and sensors capture the action. When shoppers leave, items get charged to their Amazon account. If you don't live in Seattle, sorry. There are no plans to open more locations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The water crisis in Flint, Mich., renewed focus on the nation's water quality. West Virginia's orphaned water systems perhaps best illustrate areas for improvement in water testing and cleanliness. A USA TODAY Network investigation found that more than a dozen of the state's utilities didn't have owners or operators. Enforcement efforts for those utilities amounted to little more than a continuous stream of warning letters as utilities failed to test year after year. All the while, residents continued drinking untested -- and potentially contaminated -- water. In Coal Mountain, W.Va., residents boil their water and bleach their own supply.</SPAN></P>

Bolen was thrust into the public eye when she announced she'd give up her fight with Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 2, a painful and incurable disease. Bolen's story inspired people nationwide  to help grant her dying wish by hosting a prom in her honor. Her decision wasn't without controversy. It reanimated a debate over right-to-die issues. Disability rights groups asked authorities to investigate Jerika's care, and those with her condition urged her to change her mind.
