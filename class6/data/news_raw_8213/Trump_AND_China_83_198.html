<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following are the written questions and answers from an inquiry made by the Detroit Free Press to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign on the eve of the Republican presidential nominee's return to stump in Michigan. Scott Hagerstrom, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Pence Michigan State Campaign Director, answered the questions on behalf of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opening remarks during the presidential debate specifically cited Ford -- as he has numerous times before -- as one example of a company sending U.S. jobs to Mexico. &quot;So Ford is leaving. You see that their small car division (is) leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said during the debate. But the company and UAW responded with &quot;fact checks&quot; on Twitter, saying in part Ford &quot;is not moving jobs out of Michigan. Our agreement secures future product commitments for affected plants.&quot; What's the campaign's response to that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer from Hagerstrom:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. has lost 850,000 jobs because of NAFTA, and our small trade surplus with Mexico in 1994 has become a gigantic trade deficit totaling over $60billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many companies -- like Ford, Nabisco, Carrier -- are moving production to Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michigan has lost more than 1 in 4 (27.6%) manufacturing jobs -- 228,000 jobs -- to Mexico since NAFTA went into effect in 1994. That ranks Michigan as 7th in manufacturing jobs lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1994, when NAFTA was enacted, there were 197,800 motor vehicle parts manufacturing jobs in Michigan. In August 2016, there were 126,200 jobs. This represents a loss of 71,600 jobs. The number of Michigan motor vehicle manufacturing jobs lost between January 1994 and August 2016 is 116,000 jobs, or 41.5% of total jobs in January 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I saw from financial disclosure forms that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> owns Ford Credit debt. Can you tell me why Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> thinks Ford is a good investment even though he disagrees with their decision for future investment in Mexico?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy is to retain manufacturing jobs in the U.S. and return as many manufacturing jobs as possible. Unlike Hillary's energy plan, which would encourage U.S. solar manufacturers to produce in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plan will cause manufacturers, such as Ford, to invest in the U.S. and create jobs here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have any concerns about alienating voters in southeast Michigan where there are many workers at Ford and their family and friends, who have recently benefited from the company's financial success, new hiring and hefty employee bonuses?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Michigan Department of Labor, Michigan lost 2,532 Ford automobile jobs between 2004 and 2014 to Mexico. According to Ford's latest announcement, the new plant in Mexico would create 3,000 jobs that should go to Michiganders. Other automobile manufacturers have moved billions of dollars in auto production and supplier manufacturing to Mexico, costing jobs that should now belong to Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only thing workers are offended by is Hillary Clinton's lifelong support for terrible trade deals like NAFTA and TPP. <BR></SPAN></P>
