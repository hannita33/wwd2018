<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegation that the Russians intervened in last month's election remains just that: an allegation. Even the FBI and the CIA are conflicted over what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The absence of certainty has not stopped  Hillary Clinton's supporters  from promoting the pathetic  charge that the Russians rigged the election.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One can appreciate our foreign policy establishment's anxiety about the incoming administration's apparent tilt toward Russia. The country is run by a strongman, Vladimir Putin, who has said and done much we don't like. But  suggesting he stole our election is a self-serving fallacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More investigative journalism was undertaken by the hackers, whoever they were, than by the  media establishment, which was consumed by a passion to defeat Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The information they provided was factual, giving  voters more information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as dealing with the Russians, FDR, Churchill and Truman cooperated with Stalin to defeat Hitler. In this generation, we need that same sort of cooperation with Putin to eradicate the Islamic State. We may even work with him to deal with emerging challenges from Iran and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too many still look at Russia through a Cold War lens. One thing I learned while working for President Reagan was the need  to  focus on the most important objective. Reagan's priority was defeating the Soviet Union and, yes, we did ally with some unsavory characters. The priority today? Defeat radical Islamic terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putin is by no means guiltless in the deterioration of relations between our countries. Both sides failed. We broke faith with a Putin-brokered deal with Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, which resulted in his downfall and an expansion of radical Islamic power. Putin has had ample reason to lose faith in America's resolve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's not forget that after the 9/11 attacks, Putin was the first  leader to volunteer support. The Russians were enormously helpful in facilitating the supply of our military operations in Afghanistan. After that, our relations deteriorated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama-Clinton &quot;reset&quot; with Russia failed. Under President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, we may hope for a successful reset.</SPAN></P>
