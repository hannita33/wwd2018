<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telecommunication giant SoftBank Group plans to invest $50 billion into the U.S. economy, and add 50,000 jobs, President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> announced  Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made the announcement over Twitter after meeting with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son for 45 minutes at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower. The Japanese company has a majority stake in Sprint, whose plans to merge with rival T-Mobile were thwarted by the Obama administration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Son's summit with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is very likely to rekindle the possibility of a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, wireless analyst Chetan Sharma says. &quot;Today's visit is just groundwork for an inevitable deal,&quot; Sharma says. &quot;Son has a strong interest in pursuing the merger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Son did not say what specific investments SoftBank would make, though he told The Wall Street Journal they would be part of a previously announced $100billion tech investment fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were talking about it, and then I said I'd like to celebrate his presidential job,&quot; Son said at an impromptu news conference in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower's lobby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sprint  shares rallied as much as 7%, to $8.61, hitting a  52-week high, before ending 1.5% higher. T-Mobile shares rose 1.8%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his unlikely march to the White House, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaigned on bringing more jobs to America, particularly in  regions hit hard by the recession and globalization. He took swings at companies such as  Apple for making most of their products outside the USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SoftBank is the second high-profile accord he's landed to underscore his message to voters. Last week, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> announced a controversial deal to keep furnace manufacturer Carrier from outsourcing about 1,100 jobs to Mexico. Carrier will get $7 million in state tax incentives to keep the jobs in Indiana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The name of SoftBank isn't a household word in the USA, but its holdings are vast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Son, who became a billionaire through investments in Japan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is in the midst of raising a $100 billion fund with Saudi Arabia and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's had mixed results in the USA since SoftBank bought what is now an 80% stake in Sprint for $21.6 billion and lost ground to telecom rivals such as T-Mobile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SoftBank plunked down $32 billion this year to acquire ARM Holdings, a U.K.-based chip designer that makes parts for Apple's iPhone and other products.</SPAN></P>
