<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accepted a phone call from Taiwan's president, he signaled to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that he is prepared not only to break with longtime U.S. policy but also to launch U.S.-Chinese relations on a more confrontational course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conversation with President Tsai Ing-wen was the first by a U.S. president or president-elect since 1979, when Jimmy Carter ended official relations with Taiwan after recognizing Beijing's communist government as the only representative of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province that it plans someday to unify with the mainland.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond upsetting Beijing with his call, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has accused </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of unfair trade and exerting new military muscle in Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are four issues on which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may confront </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAIWAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> conversation with Taiwan's democratically elected president is too important for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> communist leaders to ignore, said Michael Auslin, author of the soon-to-be published book The End of the Asian Century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; policy is &quot;all about separatism,&quot; Auslin said. If Taiwan can move toward independence, as many on the island want, then so can Tibet and Xinjiang, he said of Tibetan- and Muslim-majority regions in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with separatist movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can show its displeasure with the United States in areas such as economics, anti-terrorism and North Korea's nuclear program, said Cheng Li, director of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> program at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can ratchet up military activities in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, where the United States seeks to maintain freedom of navigation for commercial and  Navy ships. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> neighbors resist its territorial claims, as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonnie Glaser, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advisers are trying &quot;to show </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that things won't be conducted business as usual. ... </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seems to have bought into this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his phone call with Taiwan's leader, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweeted, &quot;Did </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into ... their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea? I don't think so!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTH </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CHINA</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SEA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweet links separate areas of conflict with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a new way, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can play that game, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has built islands on atolls and rocks and added hardened aircraft hangars and shipping piers. U.S. allies in the area have protested, and the United States has used its ships and military aircraft to enforce free access for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Until now, (the Chinese) have said these aren't military bases,&quot; Auslin said. &quot;To show </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he's going down the wrong road, I wouldn't be surprised if they say these are bases and base fighter planes on them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could deploy radar and anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, demand that foreign aircraft and vessels identify themselves in the area and bar access to military craft and ships from the USA and other nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are these small countries going to risk an encounter with Chinese fighter jets?&quot; Auslin said. &quot;It makes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the regional (superpower) and forces the U.S. to decide whether they're going to challenge </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NORTH KOREA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> signed on to international sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council last week in response to North Korea's nuclear weapons tests, but it could walk away from them, Auslin said. It could boost economic and military aid to North Korea, an ally wholly dependent on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and declare an end to international talks to end the North's nuclear program. &quot;They could use it as a stick to beat </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with,&quot; Auslin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could respond by ramping up pressure with more sanctions on Chinese companies that support North Korea and its nuclear activities. President Obama issued the first such sanctions in September. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could do more,&quot; Glaser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRADE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dumps steel and other imports at low prices to put competitors out of business, violates intellectual property rights and manipulates its currency to lower the cost of its products and make U.S. goods more expensive in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one area where the Chinese &quot;are more vulnerable than we are,&quot; Auslin said. &quot;We can find other markets. They are less able to find other markets the size of the USA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has threatened to declare </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a currency manipulator. That determination could result in tariffs on Chinese imports and a trade war, Auslin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economy would suffer, and the cost of goods would go up for U.S. consumers. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could respond by refusing to buy U.S. Treasury bonds. That would hike U.S. government borrowing costs, raise interest rates on U.S. consumers and businesses and spook the stock market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Maryland economist Phillip Swagel sees a trade war and a currency war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the horizon because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> currency will continue to fall, while </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plan to cut taxes and increase spending will make the dollar stronger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swagel said that would open opportunities for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to expand trade elsewhere in Asia. &quot;I wonder if the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bashing produces gains in other places,&quot; he said. &quot;He could portray it as shoring up Japan against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
