<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the more unusual topics of this very unusual election year has been the hitherto uncontroversial issue of the U.S. commitment to NATO. Last month, Republican presidential candidate Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> slammed NATO for being &quot;obsolete.&quot; This week, as he swept closer to the GOP nomination, he softened that to &quot;outdated&quot; but repeated his call for changes -- including making allies pay more. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders similarly has argued that the United States should scale back its NATO commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These ideas have drawn fierce criticism from the defense and foreign policy establishments. Victor Davis Hanson, a historian at the Hoover Institute, acknowledged the salience of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> argument but then backflipped to argue for the organization's continued relevance anyway: &quot;A powerful Russia will always have to be watched. A dynamic and headstrong Germany will always have to be integrated into some sort of military alliance. And the United States will always have a natural self-interest in pre-emptively keeping kindred Europeans from killing each other.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1949</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet there are good reasons to take </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Sanders' arguments seriously. On one level, NATO really is obsolete. It was established in 1949 to ensure the collective defense of Western Europe against the threat of a Soviet invasion. At the time, this did not seem like a particularly remote possibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATO succeeded in keeping Western Europe safe for more than 40 years, until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Then a curious thing happened: NATO both lost its rationale for existing and went through a dramatic expansion of member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Soviet sphere collapsed and Russia struggled with persistent economic malaise, the U.S. pushed through the admittance of Eastern European countries into NATO. By 2009, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary were  members. So were the three Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- all of which, unlike other NATO members, have common borders with Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian leaders have argued that in expanding NATO, U.S. leaders broke their promise to not exploit the Soviet collapse to extend NATO into Russia's sphere of interest. Many foreign policy writers and journalists -- consistent with the official Russian line -- say Western efforts to bring Ukraine into NATO led to the prolonged political crisis and partial Russian occupation of that beleaguered country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">War on terrorism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, NATO no longer has a clearly defined contemporary purpose. If anything, it has been the source of increasing friction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most important, it is incapable of dealing with the threats of the 21st century, especially terrorism. Collective defensive treaties are meant to ensure the safety of states against other states. They don't provide an  effective framework for confronting non-state threats such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, which use guerrilla tactics rather than amassing armies on a nation's borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's call out NATO for what it is: a 20th century organization adrift in a 21st century world. Instead of paying the majority share of its exorbitant costs, the U.S. should shift more of the burden to its NATO partners and transition to a more flexible defensive system. NATO  should be phased out and replaced by  bi- or multilateral arrangements between America and different countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under NATO, defense defines the nature of U.S. relations with the other 27 member countries. A  phaseout would allow a greater role for diplomatic relations where appropriate. Some countries might need more military assurance than others. Estonia and Latvia, for instance, could have greater defensive needs against Russian incursion than France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By reducing the financial burdens of NATO, America also would be freer to develop and strengthen partnerships in the Middle East, where Russian involvement  in Syria marks a new challenge,  and in the Pacific, where North Korea and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remain  concerns. Finally, phasing out NATO  would signal to Russia that the U.S. and Western Europe were no longer attempting to encroach on its interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renegotiating our alliance system will better reflect U.S. economic reality and allow us to better handle an increasingly complex world. We need to be able to grapple with tomorrow's problems unburdened by the legacies of yesteryear.</SPAN></P>
