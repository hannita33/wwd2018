</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Closer relations with democratic Taiwan. Unflinching support for Israel. A pledge to restore America's atrophied military power. Deregulation and tax cuts that have already sent the stock market soaring. A Cabinet with key slots assigned to individuals of impeccable integrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record of this interregnum is enough to give a determined conservative #NeverTrumper like myself pause. Was I wrong? Will America not only avert disaster but enjoy an unexpected renaissance? Is this rough orange beast slouching toward the White House the second coming of Ronald Reagan?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If so, having denounced </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in op-ed after tweet after op-ed, I will be  embarrassed. Worse, I also slammed his supporters for willful blindness at best and moral turpitude at worst, quite a few of them by name. If they turn out to be right, and I have made a monumental misassessment of President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, I will be deservedly dining on crow for the rest of my life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, I have not yet quite reached the point of repentance. Rather, as I look around at the emerging </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration, if I am not feeling vindication, I am perceiving something else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a honeymoon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is in the honeymoon phase that is part of our democratic tradition. He is America's next president, and even his harshest critics want him to succeed, to make the country prosperous and to keep it secure. In some quarters, expectations have been so low that we are  astonished when he exceeds them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be sure, exceeding them has not happened with great frequency. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is also benefiting from something else. Reflecting the bitter divisions of the campaign, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition is turning out to be one of the nastiest honeymoons in the history of marriage. Yet some of the nastiness directed at the groom is working to his advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his entourage have been subjected to relentless salvos of over-the-top criticism -- which are discrediting his detractors and building support for their target. An anti-Trumper abusing Ivanka in front of her children on a JetBlue flight is part of a larger pattern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the outgoing administration of President Obama is failing so abjectly in core duties that one wonders whether, under incoming President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, things could possibly get worse. The fall of Aleppo, Syria, has illuminated a grim and seemingly endless landscape of national security failure. We are witnessing human suffering on a grand scale while simultaneously enduring strategic defeats, with Russia and Iran making headway in the Middle East and a refugee crisis in Europe merging with a terrorism crisis to jeopardize the post-war European liberal order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama's foreign policy legacy is so appalling -- and Obama and his apologists are so blithe about what they have wrought, while also stopping to shaft Israel at the United Nations on their way out -- that it fosters the impression  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can only do better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But wait</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can do worse. All the signs of trouble that were present across his career and during the campaign are present today, plus more: the conspiracy theorists whom </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has selected as his key  national security advisers; the  tweeting about everything from a dearth of U.S. nuclear weapons, to Saturday Night Live to Vladimir Putin; the impulsive policymaking based upon whatever adviser, business partner or child has most recently entered or left the room; the cyber bullying of critics, the threats against individual companies,  the self-dealing, the incessant lying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, the audience for these eccentricities extends to the heads of state of allies and adversaries. Soon, as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gains the power to move aircraft carriers, dispatch the Marines or make nuclear threats, their impact will be magnified by the  powers of the U.S. presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also the  substance of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doctrine, encapsulated in the formula &quot;Art of the Deal.&quot; If America's relationship with the world is reduced to a balance sheet of profits and losses, how will  Taiwan fare if its security turns out to be a bargaining chip in a negotiation with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over tariffs? How will Israel fare under a president who wants to &quot;sort of be neutral&quot; between Israel and the Palestinians, who also wants to back Israel to the hilt, while also bringing about the &quot;ultimate deal&quot; between the parties? This is not strategic ambiguity; it is an incoherence replicated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> approach to every trouble spot on the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will this presidency end well? Even as I continue to fear the worst, I sincerely hope, for the good of the country, that I will soon be dining on crow.</SPAN></P>
