<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tough-talking political maverick Rodrigo Duterte took a commanding lead in the Philippines' presidential election Monday with most votes counted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duterte has claimed victory, telling the AFP: &quot;It's with humility, extreme humility, that I accept this, the mandate of the people. What I can promise you is that I will do my very best not just in my waking hours but even in my sleep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duterte, 71, the mayor of the southern city of Davao who has drawn comparisons to Republican presidential candidate Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had 38.7% of the vote, Manuel &quot;Mar&quot; Roxas, 23.3%, and Grace Poe, 21.7%, with 90% of the precincts reporting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Poe called Duterte to congratulate him, she gave a short concession speech in Tagalog at her Manila campaign headquarters. Poe told supporters that they ran a good campaign and that she respected the results of the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final result may come as early as Tuesday. About 55 million out of a total population of 100 million people were expected to cast ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duterte's political rise has come amid vows to be tough on crime and corruption. However, he has courted controversy throughout the campaign, making an almost endless stream of off-color remarks from bragging about his womanizing ways to crude comments about gang rape to publicly cursing Pope Francis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As mayor of Davao on restive Mindanao Island, Duterte has won praise from supporters for cleaning up the city's drug and crime problems, but he has advocated unusual and violent tactics including using death squads. According to Human Rights Watch, Duterte is responsible for 1,000 extrajudicial killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outspoken Duterte also has been called &quot;The Punisher&quot; and &quot;Duterte Harry,&quot; a play on Clint Eastwood's  Dirty Harry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I make it to the presidential palace, I will do just what I did as mayor. You drug pushers, holdup men and do-nothings, you better go out. Because as the mayor, I'd kill you,&quot; Duterte said during his last campaign stop on Saturday. He vowed to execute 100,000 more criminals and dump their bodies in Manila Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a televised interview after the polls closed Monday, Duterte said that if he were elected, his top priority in his first 100 days would be fixing government and stopping corruption. &quot;I can do that immediately as president,&quot; he said. &quot;Then I have to go after the drug problem and of course the criminals in this country,&quot; he told Philippine news agency Rappler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will do everything to serve the interests of the Filipino people, even if it would cost my life, honor and the office of the president,&quot; Duterte said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said at least 15 people were killed in election-related violence and more than 4,000 arrested for violating a gun ban, according to the Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election has captivated the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the most polarizing election the Philippines has had since the fall of the Marcos dictatorship in 1986,&quot; said Richard Javad Heydarian, a professor of political science at De La Salle University in the Philippines. &quot;And that in itself doesn't bode very well for the country in terms of post-election national unity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration of Aquino, who is limited to a single six-year term, has made major strides improving the Philippines' economy, which has emerged from being &quot;the sick man of Asia&quot; to one of the region's fastest-growing economies, averaging more than 6% annual growth and upgrading its sovereign credit rating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duterte has said he would delegate economic policy matters to expert advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think growth will, more likely than not, continue,&quot; Ramon del Rosario Jr., chairman of the Makati Business Club, told a group of Filipino journalists this past week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A more significant change may lie ahead on the geopolitical front, where the Philippines has been locked in a territorial dispute with an increasingly assertive Chinese military presence in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Aquino administration, the Philippines has primarily relied on support from the United States, signing an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement to allow a greater presence of U.S. troops and facilities at Philippine bases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Philippines has also turned to the international community, with a pending case against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the International Arbitration Court in the Hague, Netherlands, over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;nine-dotted line&quot; that claims jurisdiction over much of the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has refused to participate in the arbitration, which is being held under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. <BR></SPAN></P>
