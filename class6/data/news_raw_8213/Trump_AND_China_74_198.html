<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After meetings with the CEOs of Boeing and Lockheed Martin on Wednesday, President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he and the aircraft makers will work to try to reduce costs on major defense projects, including a new Air Force One.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're just beginning -- it's a dance,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told reporters following a series of conferences at his golf resort in Palm Beach, Fla. &quot;It's a little bit of a dance. But we're going to get the costs down, and we're going to get it done beautifully.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of his guests, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, told reporters his company would cut the $4billion estimate of a new Air Force One, a price tag that had raised the president-elect's ire. &quot;We work on Air Force One because it's important to our country,&quot; he said, &quot;and we're going to make sure that he gets the best capability and that it's done affordably.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> met with defense contractors on a day in which aides released a schedule of inaugural events next month and as he sought to push back on critics who emphasize his loss of the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by saying he aimed for a win in the Electoral College all along.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult &amp; sophisticated than the popular vote,&quot; the president-elect tweeted. &quot;Hillary focused on the wrong states!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> meetings with the CEOs of Boeing and Lockheed Martin came just weeks after he criticized the size of government contracts they hold for the new Air Force One and F-35 joint strike fighter, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the president-elect has threatened to cancel a Boeing contract for a new Air Force One, military officials say the presidential plane needs an upgrade, including enhanced (and expensive) security equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a tweet earlier this month, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that &quot;the F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said his meetings Wednesday dealt mostly with the F-35, saying that &quot;we're trying to get costs down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect also spoke with members of the Air Force leadership, one of whom could be seen carrying a binder with a photo of Air Force One on the cover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking with reporters, Muilenburg said that &quot;we're all focused on the same thing here, we're going to make sure that we give our war fighters the best capability in the world and that we do it in a way that is affordable for our taxpayers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other developments Wednesday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appointed businessman and investor Carl Icahn as &quot;special adviser&quot; on issues related to streamlining federal regulations. In a statement, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called Icahn &quot;not only a brilliant negotiator, but also someone who is innately able to predict the future especially having to do with finances and economies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announced that economist Peter Navarro would be the new director of Trade and Industrial Policy, working to correct what the president-elect has called unfair trade agreements with other nations. Navarro will lead the newly created White House National Trade Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that he read one of Navarro's books &quot;years ago,&quot; the president-elect said that &quot;he has presciently documented the harms inflicted by globalism on American workers, and laid out a path forward to restore our middle class. He will fulfill an essential role in my administration as a trade adviser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Navarro has advocated a tougher trade line with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spoke with reporters briefly and condemned the recent violence in Germany and Turkey, saying that &quot;what's going on is terrible.&quot; Asked specifically about the terrorist attack in Berlin on Monday that left at least nine people dead, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called the assault on a Christmas market by a man driving a truck an &quot;attack on humanity, and it's got to be stopped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began the day on social media, defending what he called his election strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton, the Democratic candidate, won more than 65.8 million votes in the election, some 2.8 million more than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won more states, cruising to victory in the Electoral College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote -- but would campaign differently,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said during his brief tweet storm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss!&quot; <BR></SPAN></P>
