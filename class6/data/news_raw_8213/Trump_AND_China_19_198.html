<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Completing his historic drive to the Republican presidential nomination, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told a divided Republican Party on Thursday that he will be the &quot;voice&quot; for frustrated Americans who have been let down by government and the &quot;elites&quot; who run it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told a fired-up crowd of backers that packed the downtown Quicken Loans Arena.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After ascending the stage to the theme from the action film Air Force One, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he &quot;humbly and gratefully&quot; accepted the Republican nomination to the presidency, then launched into a prepared teleprompter speech peppered with caustic asides about career politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to promoting his own qualifications for the White House, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> speech was aimed at uniting a convention in which the runner-up in the primary campaign refused to endorse him, critical delegates staged a noisy floor fight over the rules, and a string of high-profile Republicans boycotted the entire event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> argued that the United States is in decline under the Obama administration, citing a litany of grim statistics about crime and violence, terrorism and national security, and the rising number of Americans who have stopped looking for work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Election opponent Hillary Clinton and other Democrats are to blame for many of the nation's ills, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, and the problems of poverty, violence and war &quot;will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hitting the former secretary of State for foreign policy problems ranging from Libya to the rise of the Islamic State, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Clinton's legacy is one of &quot;death, destruction, terrorism and weakness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing the recent spate of police killings and terrorism, the businessman who has never held public office promised that &quot;the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon, and I mean very soon, come to an end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echoing promises he has made since hitting the campaign trail 13 months ago, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he will stop illegal immigration with a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and change trade agreements that he claims have sucked manufacturing jobs out of the United States to foreign countries. He again blasted what he called the unfair trade tactics of competitors like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in past months has proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, he said Thursday that the suspension would apply only to migrants &quot;from any nation that has been comprised by terrorism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the day, the Clinton campaign and other Democratic groups sent out statements denouncing various </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policies as ineffectual, divisive or simply wrong-headed and accused him of distorting Clinton's records. They also cited Republican infighting over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including the refusal of many high-profile Republicans to endorse the party's new standard-bearer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his hour-plus remarks, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recited a string of slogans he used at rallies across the country in the past year, including &quot;Law and Order,&quot; &quot;America First,&quot; a &quot;rigged system,&quot; and -- the original campaign theme -- &quot;Make America Great Again.&quot; The crowd responded with repeated ovations and chants like &quot;build that wall!&quot; and &quot;U-S-A!&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> himself occasionally joined in the &quot;U-S-A&quot; chants, flashing the crowd a thumbs-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mocking the pro-Clinton slogan -- &quot;I'm With Her&quot; -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told delegates: &quot;I'm with you, the American people: I am your voice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as in previous rallies, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had to pause at one point as a protester heckled him and had to be removed by security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> put the final touches on his speech and did a walk-though of the stage set-up Thursday, he took to Twitter to proclaim the convention a success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is VERY united,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweeted. &quot;Great love in the arena!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daughter Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> introduced her father to the noisy crowd that packed Cleveland's basketball arena, telling them he is a &quot;fighter&quot; who became &quot;the people's nominee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahead of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> big night a flap arose over his commitment to U.S. military alliances, including NATO. When The New York Times asked the candidate about the prospect of a Russian attack on NATO allies in the Baltic States, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he would authorize help only after deciding whether those countries &quot;have fulfilled their obligations to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Republicans who have questioned </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> grasp of foreign policy reacted with indignation. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;is essentially telling Russians/other bad actors&quot; that the United States &quot;is not fully committed to supporting NATO alliance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> convention ends a day after ex-primary rival Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas refused to endorse the party's nominee during his convention speech, inciting a chorus of boos from pro-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a meeting of the Texas delegation Thursday, Cruz noted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has criticized his wife's looks and all but accused his dad of participating in a plot to assassinate President John F. Kennedy. &quot;I wasn't going to come like a servile puppy dog and say 'Thank you very much' for maligning my wife and father,&quot; Cruz said. <BR></SPAN></P>
