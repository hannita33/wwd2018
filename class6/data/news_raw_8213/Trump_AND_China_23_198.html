<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilbur Ross, the billionaire financier nominated by Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be secretary of Commerce, said Wednesday that he would pursue more treaties with individual trading partner nations and vowed to crack down on trade agreement violators, singling out </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repeatedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am pro-trade. But I am pro-sensible trade, not trade that is detrimental to the American worker and to the domestic manufacturing base,&quot; Ross said before the U.S. Senate's Commerce, Science &amp; Transportation Committee, which will deliberate on his nomination.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tough talk on trade -- including threats of high tariffs and renegotiating trade deals -- has unnerved economists and exporting companies that fear retaliation. But Ross sought to sell the idea that more bilateral agreements, which are &quot;easier and quicker to negotiate&quot; than the ones involving multiple countries, can boost exports. Negotiating with a dozen countries for a trade agreement will result in multiple and unintended concessions, he said. &quot;The more complex the environment in which you negotiate, the less likely you'll get sensible results,&quot; he said. &quot;You take a lot of nicks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;is the most protectionist country among very large countries,&quot; Ross told the lawmakers in the committee. &quot;They actually talk more about free trade than they practice. We'd like to level the playing field.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His hearing, which was scheduled for last week, had been delayed to give Ross more time to complete the ethics and financial disclosure forms that are required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several other confirmation hearings are scheduled this week -- including one Thursday for Steven Mnuchin, the nominee for Treasury secretary -- before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is sworn in Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If confirmed, Ross will head the key executive branch agency that enforces American trade policies, generates 40% of publicly available federal government data, manages patents, oversees the nation's wireless spectrum, operates the Census and monitors the conditions of the oceans and the atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his nomination primarily signals </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> oft-stated plans to re-examine global trade and bring private-sector experts to produce more jobs and favorable trade terms for U.S. companies. And Ross' role is expected to be expanded  beyond the traditional parameters of Commerce secretary so he can work with other trade officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've made my livelihood for over five decades dealing in international commerce,&quot; Ross said. &quot;I think I've probably had more direct experience than any prior Cabinet nominee has had with unfair trade in the steel business, in the textile business, in the auto parts business and other sectors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ross, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes to be about $2.9 billion, made his fortune in private equity. Hailed as &quot;the king of bankruptcy,&quot; he bought struggling companies and overhauled their operations, often leading to layoffs, before selling them at hefty profit margins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ross defended the work of his investment firm, WL Ross &amp; Co., pointing to jobs saved in rescuing companies that may have otherwise been liquidated. Tuesday, Reuters reported the companies controlled by his firm eliminated about 2,700 jobs since 2004 in the textile, finance and auto-parts industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his filing with the Office of Government Ethics posted Tuesday, Ross disclosed plans to sell about 80 assets in the coming months to avoid conflicts of interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will also step down from dozens of companies and organizations he's involved in as investor and board member. Ross declined to say whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should follow suit and divest holdings, saying the rules are different for presidents and that he didn't have the &quot;exactitude&quot; of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> financials to give an opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ross and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have known each other for decades. Ross lives in a Palm Beach estate with his third wife, not far from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mar-a-Lago club. In 1990, Ross, then working as head of Rothschild Investment's bankruptcy advisory practice, represented a group of bondholders who were looking to have </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City declare bankruptcy after it missed a bond payment. Ross and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> eventually worked out a bankruptcy transaction to keep the casino running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ross then formed his own private equity firm in 2000 with $440 million in investor money. In the early 2000s, he acquired the factories of Pennsylvania's Bethlehem Steel, Cleveland-based LTV and other manufacturers and consolidated them into a new company, International Steel Group. It was then sold to Mittal Steel for $4.5 billion in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In keeping with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recent Twitter announcements and campaign rhetoric across the Rust Belt states, Ross echoed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> message about restoring jobs in the industries that have been affected by trade and automation. The North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade deals will be reviewed. And he's also in favor of &quot;automatic reopening&quot; of trade agreements after a few years to gauge effectiveness and changes that need to be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should not put up with malicious trading activities, state-owned enterprises or subsidized production,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was mentioned frequently by lawmakers, and Ross was blunt in his assessment of the country as a difficult trading partner. He was particularly critical of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> non-tariff barriers, saying he had been exposed to them while running his companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a lot of cases, it's not a fair fight,&quot; he said. <BR></SPAN></P>
