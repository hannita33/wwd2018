hong kong -- an american labor union is pushing the united states to impose broad, steep tariffs on aluminum imports using a little-used but wide-ranging trade law that has riled the country's trading partners in the past. the effort by the united steelworkers union comes with trade increasingly an election-year issue in the united states and elsewhere. more than three-quarters of the united states aluminum smelting industry that existed five years ago will have been idled or shut down by this summer as imports have surged, according to the union's legal petition.     the union blames china's rising exports, though if successful its effort would also affect american imports from canada and many other countries.   the union's law firm on monday filed a petition covering raw aluminum imports with an american trade panel. the petition invokes section 201 of the 1974 trade act. the section was last invoked by president george w. bush in 2001 to start a legal process that led to american tariffs on steel imports the following year.   a section 201 case covers essentially all imports of a product from all over the world. that makes it more substantial than anti-subsidy and anti-dumping cases against imports from a single country. the european union objected to president bush's use of section 201, which resulted in american tariffs on a wide range of steel products, until the administration dropped them in late 2003.   but section 201 cases are also harder to win. they require proof that a domestic industry has been ''seriously injured'' by imports, a harder test than the mere proof of ''injury'' from imports that is required for other trade cases.   terence p. stewart, the managing partner of the law firm stewart and stewart and the lead lawyer on the aluminum case, contended that raw aluminum could meet the test. ''the domestic industry is disappearing before our eyes,'' he said. ''quick relief and addressing the underlying imbalance between global supply and demand are essential if we are going to have any industry left.''   the union also argues that aluminum is important to national defense because it is widely used in military equipment.   section 201 cases are reviewed by the united states international trade commission, a bipartisan, quasi-judicial group of trade experts in washington. the commission then makes a recommendation within two to six months to the president, who makes the final decision on whether to impose tariffs. the law allows government officials, industries or unions to file claims.   presidents have almost always followed the commission's advice, although president carter turned down a recommendation for tariffs on stainless steel flatware in 1978 and president george h.w. bush rejected a recommendation for tariffs on extruded rubber threads in 1992. the office of the united states trade representative declined to comment on the union's contentions.  china, which already produces more than half the world's aluminum, is expanding capacity even as its economy decelerates. the result has been a surge in exports and falling prices for aluminum.   chinese exports of aluminum jumped more than 27 percent in the past two years, chinese customs figures show.   a spokesman for the government-affiliated china aluminum association, who gave his family name as zeng, said aluminum's increasing use in high-speed railway equipment, aerospace and electronics justified china's expanding production capacity and rising exports.   smelters in canada and elsewhere, having been displaced in their traditional international markets, have stepped up shipments of raw aluminum to the united states. american imports of raw aluminum from canada, the biggest supplier, jumped 10 percent by tonnage last year, united states customs data shows.   other factors are influencing the aluminum trade. alcoa, the main aluminum smelting company in the united states, has announced the closing of a series of smelting operations in the united states while relying more on production in canada, iceland and saudi arabia, as part of what it describes as an effort to improve overall efficiency. in a statement it said, ''alcoa has a long history of cooperation with the u.s. government. we haven't seen the petition and look forward to reviewing it.''   exports to the united states are an important source of employment in china, and chinese officials have been increasingly concerned about donald j. trump's populist appeals for a tougher trade policy, including a steep tariff on goods from china. finance minister lou jiwei of china told the wall street journal during a visit to washington in the past week that imposing such a tariff would violate world trade organization rules.	1
after delegates to the republican national convention officially selected donald trump and mike pence as their candidates tuesday, they set their sights on hillary clinton amid excoriating speeches and cries of "lock her up!"  trump is scheduled to accept the nomination in a speech thursday. he appeared on video high above the convention floor to thank the convention. "this is a movement, but we have to go all the way," he said. "we are going to win the presidency and bring real change and leadership back to washington." indiana gov. mike pence was heralded by the state's lieutenant governor, eric holcolm, as "a great man of integrity, a proven conservative." it didn't take long for the ebullient mood to turn negative as a parade of speakers castigated democrat hillary clinton over her e-mail controversy, the deaths of four americans in benghazi, libya, and even her treatment of women. new jersey gov. chris christie listed what he called clinton's crimes around the world, from cuba to china, each time asking the crowd, "guilty or not guilty?" sharon day, co-chair of the republican national committee,  targeted former president bill clinton's private life -- a theme likely to be repeated over the next couple of days. "as first lady, you viciously attacked women who were sexually abused at the hands of your husband," day said. house speaker paul ryan, who came late to the trump bandwagon, sought to bring the party together with a more positive, policy-oriented message. "what do you say that we unify this party?" he said. "let's get on the offensive, and let's stay there." signs of continuing discord were evident off the convention floor. in the midst of the roll call, ohio gov. john kasich -- who placed third in the nomination contest -- wasn't even in the hall. he was speaking to members of the u.s. hispanic chamber of commerce. "in a political campaign, what you say should be what you mean," kasich said, adding that trump's convention "is not where i think i need to be." as soon as trump tweeted about the roll call, clinton's campaign responded by urging supporters to text, register and "make sure he never becomes president." through the night, ryan, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and vanquished presidential candidates christie and ben carson were among those who urged a united effort to defeat clinton, the leader in most national polls. 	3
for years, chief executive officers lived in fear they would become a target of the activist investor carl icahn. now, they live in dread of a different and somewhat more unexpected kind of activist: president donald j. trump.    as corporate executives around the globe try to understand the implications of the trump administration on their businesses, they seem to be having an almost bipolar reaction: a euphoric sense that regulations and taxes could soon be lowered -- which would likely increase their profits and paychecks -- yet a simultaneous anxiety that they could become a target of one of the president's twitter tirades, which could undo their businesses or possibly their careers.   over the last two months, dozens of chief executives have made pilgrimages to trump tower on fifth avenue in new york city. the ritual involves being photographed in the lobby in front of the gold elevators and having your name hastily tweeted by the throngs (journalistic and otherwise) involved in the spectator sport.   for the moment, the action seems to have shifted to washington. on monday, a bevy of executives -- elon musk of tesla, kevin plank of under armour and andrew liveris of dow chemical among them -- arrived for a 9 a.m. meeting at the white house.    this meeting and similar ones, according to more than a dozen executives who have attended them, are viewed by the executive class not only as an opportunity to help shape policy in their favor, but also, perhaps more important, as a defensive measure aimed at making ''friends'' with the new president so as to avoid his wrath later.   make no mistake: companies are making changes -- or, at least, public announcements -- aimed (in part or in whole) at appealing to or appeasing mr. trump. amazon said it was hiring 100,000 new employees. ford canceled plans to build a factory in mexico and said it would create 700 jobs domestically.   on monday, foxconn, the large taiwanese manufacturer behind apple's iphone, said it might spend $7 billion in the united states to build a factory that could employ 50,000 people.   the story, which garnered headlines all over the world, was a clear sop to mr. trump: in many ways, foxconn's statement was seen as a hedge against the possibility that the new president, who has threatened a trade war with china and criticized apple for manufacturing iphones abroad, might seek to put further pressure on its business.   jack ma, the founder of alibaba, visited mr. trump two weeks ago and announced plans to build an online platform that he pledged would create a million jobs in the midwest for farmers and small businesses to export goods to china. the plan had been in the works before mr. trump was elected, but clearly it helped grease the skids with mr. trump, who took mr. ma to pose for pictures in the lobby of trump tower.   masayoshi son, the leader of softbank, was seemingly used as a prop by mr. trump when he said in december that he planned to invest $50 billion in the united states -- even though he had announced plans to start a $100 billion fund more than a month earlier, and much of the money was almost certainly expected to be spent in the united states.   ''i have a sneaky feeling that amazon and many others do not want to rile trump,'' tim bajarin the president of creative strategies inc., a consulting firm, wrote in an essay on recode. ''what he says and does from his 'bully pulpit' could hurt them during his time in office.''   mr. icahn, a friend and supporter of mr. trump's, who was recently named a special adviser on regulation, said in a telephone interview, ''you are correct in saying my relationships with companies is somewhat analogous'' to mr. trump's own relationships with the leaders of them.   ''if they are taking advantage of the system, they should be scared,'' mr. icahn said of corporations. ''remember, many of the guys i went after deserved to be scared -- but in many cases, i bought stock in companies with managements i liked, and i helped them get things done with recalcitrant boards.''   ''it will be a bumpy road,'' mr. icahn said. ''but in the long run he will do a great job with the country.''   while some executives may be focused on the optics of their businesses in relation to mr. trump, laurence d. fink, the chairman and chief executive of blackrock, the largest money manager in the world overseeing over $5 trillion -- that's with a ''t'' -- suggests that each company must rethink its strategy.   ''we believe that it is imperative that companies understand these changes and adapt their strategies as necessary,'' mr. fink wrote in a letter to the nation's top public company executives that he is in the process of sending out. ''not just following a year like 2016, but as part of a constant process of understanding the landscape in which you operate.''   ''we will be looking to see how your strategic framework reflects and recognizes the impact of the past year's changes in the global environment,'' mr. fink added. ''how have these changes impacted your strategy and how do you plan to pivot, if necessary, in light of the new world in which you are operating?''   one of the big issues that companies are likely to confront -- and that mr. trump may confront for them if they aren't lucky -- is how they might use repatriated cash if tax reforms are passed in washington. mr. trump has made his presidency about creating jobs. yet many chief executives have already said that if they are able to repatriate cash at a low tax rate, they will engage in stock buybacks and mergers and acquisitions. (in the 12 months ending in the third quarter of 2016, blackrock pointed out that ''the value of dividends and buybacks by s&p 500 companies exceeded those companies' operating profit.'')   mr. fink warned that he was watching, too. ''if tax reform also includes some form of reduced taxation for repatriation of cash trapped overseas, blackrock will be looking to companies' strategic frameworks for an explanation of whether they will bring cash back to the u.s. -- and if so, how they plan to use it. will it be used simply for more share buybacks? or is it a part of a capital plan that appropriately balances returning capital to shareholders with prudently investing for future growth?''   between mr. trump and the investor class, chief executives may be cornered in their offices more than ever as they try to adjust to the new reality.   adam grant, a professor of management and psychology at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania, said behavioral scientists had a term to describe the way chief executives were thinking about mr. trump: it is called an ''ambivalent relationship.''	9
given recent history, the next president can expect to face an even more unpredictable world than the one president obama is dealing with. russia, china, syria, iran, north korea, the islamic state -- the list of security challenges is daunting. it will require smart policy choices backed by a powerful military to protect american interests. so far, the candidates have not sufficiently explained their approaches to military spending which, at $580 billion for 2016, is half of the federal discretionary budget. the toughest talk comes from the republicans who lean dangerously toward a one-dimensional view of american strength that is over-reliant on an all-powerful military.     ''i will make our military so big, powerful and strong that no one will mess with us,'' donald trump says.  but what does that mean? this is the guy who extolled the power of nuclear deterrence in a recent debate, but didn't know it relies on three types of forces -- missiles, planes and submarines.   like his rivals for the party's nomination -- senator marco rubio, senator ted cruz and gov. john kasich -- mr. trump supports lifting the caps on the defense budget. some of the candidates act as if these fiscal restraints were imposed by mr. obama, when in fact they resulted from a 2011 compromise between the white house and the republican-led congress. the caps are overly restrictive, but they have helped rein in out-of-control military spending.   mr. rubio wants to ''restore military strength'' by building more ships and submarines, reversing troop cuts and expanding missile defenses. that would cost an additional $1 trillion over the next 10 years, benjamin friedman, a defense expert at the cato institute, estimates. although mr. cruz is eager to shrink the rest of the government, his plans to salvage a ''shockingly undermanned and ill-prepared'' fighting force would increase military spending by $2.5 trillion over eight years, mr. friedman says. mr. kasich would also raise military spending, but more slowly than mr. rubio and mr. cruz.   giving the pentagon a blank check does not ensure security. it got most of what it wanted in the decade after 9/11, yet america still struggles to keep afghanistan and iraq from falling to insurgents.   the republican candidates mislead the public when they say the military is hollowed out; it is the world's most advanced fighting force, with a larger budget than the next seven countries combined. still, the endless wars have taken a toll on troops and weapons. there is also a budget crisis coming, because many of the new systems under development will reach their peak funding years in the 2020s.   before any infusion of new funds, the pentagon, which has wasted billions of dollars on misguided programs, needs to prove it can be a better steward. congress needs to reform the military health care program, whose costs are spiraling out of control. one place to save: scale back the planned $1 trillion, 30-year modernization of a nuclear arsenal that will never be used and spend the money on conventional weapons that are needed to fight the islamic state and other threats. hillary clinton and senator bernie sanders, unlike the republican candidates, have said they are open to this.   mrs. clinton has advocated the idea of ''smart power,'' which relies on a range of tools, diplomatic as well as military, to keep the nation safe. she has said she would name a commission to study military spending. mr. sanders wants a ''robust military'' but opposes spending increases.   america needs a strong and technologically advanced military, but politically driven excessive investment in the pentagon has too often meant short shrift for the state department and its diplomatic missions, as well as cuts in domestic programs that hurt the most vulnerable citizens. it is crucial for the next president to get that balance right.   follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter, and sign up for the opinion today newsletter.	9
1. we'll get to the major stories of the day in a second, but first, as you head into your weekend, we wanted to bring you a reminder that we still live in a world of wonders. we asked our science reporters to share the most memorable stories they reported on this year. here's what they told us.  2. president obama warned that the american government would respond to russia's efforts to influence the presidential election with "a clear message." at a news conference, before leaving for vacation in hawaii, he defended his restrained response to the hacking and said that he told vladimir putinto "cut it out" months ago. hillary clinton spoke out on thursday, accusing mr. putin of ordering the hack "because he has a personal beef against me." 3. the reaction to president-elect donald trump's nominee for ambassador to israel, david friedman, above, has been highly polarized. mr. friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer with no diplomatic experience, has long espoused hard-right, pro-israel views that are often at odds with united states policy. mr. trump has filled most top positions in his cabinet, but still has not named a democrat. he is continuing his victory tour with a rally in florida tonight. 4. the process of evacuating residents from the last rebel-held section of aleppo broke down on friday amid confusion and concerns over reports of summary killings. more than 8,000 people have been taken out of the syrian city, but many thousands are said to remain. videos shared on social media showed the harrowing evacuation journey. 5. the war in syria has garnered international attention, but in yemen, another conflict has been largely forgotten by the world. our journalists went there last month to report on the devastating effects of the fighting, which has displaced more than 2.5 million people. the united states has publicly kept its distance from the war, but saudi pilots - who have been bombing rebels in the capital, sana - often fly american-made fighter jets and drop american-made munitions. 6. the united states is demanding the return of an underwater drone that has been seized by a chinese warship in the south china sea. the drone was carrying out scientific research when it went missing, a defense department official said. on thursday, china signaled that it had installed weapons on disputed islands in the waterway. american officials are trying to determine whether the seizure was a low-level action taken by chinese sailors, or if it was more strategic. 7. in north carolina, the republican-controlled state legislature approved a sweeping package of restrictions to curb the powers governor-elect roy cooper, a democrat, above. one of them was quickly signed by the outgoing one-term gov. pat mccrory, a republican. protesters were removed from the house and senate galleries after yelling and chanting, and a number of people were arrested throughout the day in acts of civil disobedience. 8. there's a special resonance to tonight's broadcast of "jeopardy!" it features cindy stowell, who was on a winning streak, even as she battled stage 4 colon cancer. 9. frigid temperatures continue to hang over the northern half of the united states, and some areas are expecting snow, sleet and freezing rain. and it doesn't look like it's going to warm up this weekend. if you're planning to stay inside, here's a guide to streaming the best movies of 2016. competitions take place in water that is 41 degrees or less, and the risk to the body is real. still, the races seem to attract interest in spite of the dangers, or perhaps because of them. 11. finally, we bring you a story of good intentions - which, as we all know, sometimes fall short (specifically, in this case, six feet short). in montreal, there was an idea to celebrate the city's upcoming 375th anniversary by putting up a christmas tree bigger and grander than the famous one in new york. then everything went wrong. the tree is skinny, misshapen and widely unloved, but let's not forget: charlie brown's christmas tree was, too. photographs may appear out of order for some readers. viewing this version of the briefing should help. and don't miss your morning briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. eastern, and your weekend briefing, posted at 6 a.m. sundays. what did you like? what do you want to see here? let us know at briefing@nytimes.com.related articles	9
hillary clinton vowed not to send american ground troops to iraq ''ever again'' and donald j. trump insinuated that he had learned shocking new information involving president obama -- without ever revealing it -- as the two candidates made back-to-back appearances wednesday night at a forum that foreshadowed their highly anticipated debate later this month. mrs. clinton, who was frequently put on the defensive by audience members asking questions about her judgment, sought to reassure voters that she would be a forceful and steady commander in chief, noting her role in the killing of osama bin laden and pledging that defeating the islamic state was her ''highest counterterrorism goal.''    she promised air power and other support to arab and muslim allies but added, ''we are not putting ground troops into iraq ever again, and we're not putting them into syria.''    mr. trump was withering in his attacks on her record while vague about his own, and defensive about his shifting stands on the iraq war over the years. he repeatedly declared that he was ready to handle national security issues, without being challenged.   ''a hundred percent,'' mr. trump said, one of several instances when he made blunt assertions but provided no details. he was especially insistent in defending his praise of the russian president, vladimir v. putin, arguing that mr. putin had ''an 82 percent approval rating'' in his country.   of the two candidates, mrs. clinton faced by far the tougher and most probing questions from the moderator, matt lauer of nbc, and from an audience of military veterans about her use of private email, her vote authorizing the iraq war, her hawkish foreign policy views and other issues.   she appeared stilted at first, particularly when one republican -- a veteran who had held a top-secret naval flight clearance -- said he would have been ''prosecuted and imprisoned'' if he had handled classified information as she did on her private email server. he charged that she had ''clearly corrupted our national security.''   ''i appreciate your concern and also your experience,'' mrs. clinton began, and then launched into a lengthy explanation, describing the designations for classified material and how she had handled the most sensitive material ''very seriously.''   the forum, which took place at the intrepid sea, air & space museum in manhattan, served as a preview of sorts for the first clinton-trump debate set for sept. 26, with both candidates drawing differences over policy and testing out lines on national security and other issues.   it was also a rare moment when mrs. clinton and mr. trump all but appeared in the same room together, talking one after the other and facing the same audience and moderator. by the end of the night, the candidates offered a study in contrasts on substance and style.   mrs. clinton was far more specific than mr. trump in laying out her ideas to provide mental health care and create jobs for veterans, and she highlighted her extensive foreign policy experience as secretary of state and as a member of the senate armed services committee.   on body language, the two diverged as well. mrs. clinton was far more likely to look audience members in the eye, nod along as they expressed concern or curiosity, and give relatively direct if sometimes uncomfortable answers. mr. trump came off as more relaxed but also far lighter on policy explanations, and he faced no questions about his past insults of veterans and their families or his own vietnam-era draft deferments.   one of the most surprising moments of the night came when mr. trump chose to answer a question about the confidential national security briefings that he has recently begun to receive -- a topic that presidents and presidential candidates rarely discuss with any openness.   mr. trump, asked if he learned anything alarming, said, ''there was one thing that shocked me'' and suggested that it involved a decision by president obama and mrs. clinton that amounted to ''a total disaster.''   he then went further, asserting that mr. obama ''did not follow what our experts'' said to do, and even claimed that the government officials who provided the briefing were ''not happy'' with mr. obama. explaining the basis of that assessment, mr. trump said, ''i was pretty good with the body language.''   it was a classic trump moment -- a dark insinuation without evidence -- and his campaign declined to provide details after the debate.   mr. trump ridiculed mr. obama as much as he did mrs. clinton during his 25-minute appearance, deriding the president over the recent diplomatic incident in china where local officials would not provide the requisite staircase for air force one. ''they wouldn't give him stairs,'' mr. trump said.   both candidates also lamented the surge in suicides among veterans, with mrs. clinton offering the most details and expressions of empathy over the problems of poor mental health care and the widespread use of painkillers for veterans.   ''i've spent a lot of time with family members, survivors, who have lost a loved one when he or she came home,'' mrs. clinton said. ''we've got to remove the stigma'' of depression and other mental health problems.   mr. trump put the blame for suicide squarely on the department of veterans affairs, blasting it as ''almost a corrupt enterprise'' and saying that veterans were killing themselves because ''they are under tremendous pain and they can't see a doctor.''   several polls have shown mr. trump with a solid lead over mrs. clinton among veterans, yet she has drawn an unusually strong number of endorsements from generals and admirals as well as national security experts who served under republican presidents.   mr. trump, who went to pains to point out that several generals in the audience were supporting him, has increasingly sought to position himself as the candidate of the military -- in part, aides say, to increase his chances of winning swing states like florida and virginia, where there are sizable numbers of veterans and military families.   earlier on wednesday he called for a massive expansion of the military, including many thousands more troops for the army for a total of 540,000 and increasing the number of marine corps battalions from 23 to 36. to do so, mr. trump said he would ask congress to eliminate so-called sequestration caps on military spending that have forced the reduction of troops -- budget limits that mr. trump had supported until recently.   but in a sign of the relatively gentle questioning of mr. trump at the forum, no one challenged him over the chances that his proposals would come to pass. democrats in congress have stood firm against lifting the caps unless domestic spending is allowed to grow too, and some military analysts have questioned the need for some spending goals.   one of the few confrontations between the two candidates -- albeit indirect, with mr. lauer pressing one after the other -- came over the future of government-run veterans' hospitals and other services. mrs. clinton promised to improve services and then, in a potent warning to veterans and their family members, suggested that mr. trump would harm veterans' services by putting them in the hands of private health providers.   ''i will not let the v.a. be privatized and i do think there's an agenda out there supported by my opponent to do just that,'' mrs. clinton said.   mr. trump adamantly denied the charge. ''i never said take the veterans administration private,'' he said. ''i have too much respect'' for veterans, he added.   yet mr. trump's proposals would most likely prompt many veterans to choose private care and lead to a vastly smaller government health system for veterans. he said on wednesday that veterans should be able to choose any private doctor or hospital rather than wait for treatment from veterans' hospitals, and promised that the federal government would ''pay the bill.''   such an option would cost many billions of dollars, yet mr. trump has not said how he would cover the costs beyond ending ''waste, fraud and abuse at the v.a.''   it was one of several moments when mr. trump bobbed and weaved -- a concern that clinton advisers have about the coming debates if the moderators do not force him to back up his statements.   he denigrated military generals during the forum, saying they had been ''reduced to rubble'' under mr. obama, but he was not pressed on those assertions.   and he did not back away from his 2013 twitter post in which he suggested that the integration of women into the military had played a role in sexual assaults.   find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via facebook, twitter and the first draft newsletter.	9
apodaca, mexico -- in 30 years at whirlpool, working at the company's manufacturing plant in this industrial mexican town, josé luis rico has witnessed some pretty major changes. the work force has grown, churning out refrigerators that look more like robots than the simple models of his early career. fueling the changes was a free-trade agreement among mexico, canada and the united states that promised to lift mexico into the future.    what did not seem to go up, however, was mr. rico's salary. after a handful of raises, he still earns well under $10,000 a year -- a sum, he argues, that hardly makes mexico the big winner of the north american free trade agreement that president-elect donald j. trump says it is.   in fact, to mr. rico and many other mexican workers, politicians and economists, nafta does not feel much like a win at all.    ''it's more like survival,'' mr. rico said. ''i thought it would make my life better, that this agreement would create opportunities for everyone.''   ''maybe it has,'' he added, nodding toward the whirlpool logo on the entrance to the complex. ''just not for us.''   mr. trump made questioning the virtues of nafta a centerpiece of his campaign, at one point calling it ''the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere,'' and he has not slowed down since his election. on tuesday alone, he criticized general motors for shipping cars made in mexico to the united states, claimed credit for a decision by ford to cancel plans for a new factory in mexico, and named a well-known advocate of protectionist policies, robert lighthizer, his chief trade negotiator.   his argument has driven the narrative that where the american worker lost, the mexican economy gained.   but here in mexico, there is an increasing belief that nafta, despite drawing an enormous amount of investment to the country, has been a big disappointment.   ''at the end of the day, as a development strategy, it should have led to higher sustained growth, generated well-paid salaries and reduced the gap between mexico and the united states,'' said gerardo esquivel, an economist at the colegio de méxico. ''it has remained well below what was hoped for.''   mexico's economy has grown an average of just 2.5 percent a year under nafta, a fraction of what was needed to provide the jobs and prosperity its supporters promised. more than half of mexicans still live below the poverty line, a proportion that remains unchanged from 1993, before the deal went into effect.   wages in mexico have stagnated for more than a decade, and the stubborn gap between the nation's rich and poor persists. a majority of workers in mexico toil in the obscurity of under-the-table jobs at workshops, markets and farms for their survival.   new technologies, meanwhile, have cut many jobs while increasing productivity, which is good news for businesses but a blow to the work force.   ''mexico is seeing exactly the same phenomenon as in the united states,'' said timothy a. wise, a research fellow at tufts university. ''workers have declining bargaining power on both sides of the border.''   in part, nafta's failure to achieve its potential falls on the mexican government's shoulders, experts say. rather than use the agreement as a launching point to grow and invest in many sectors of the mexican economy, successive governments viewed the trade deal as a silver bullet for the country's economic woes.   all of this is not lost on mexicans, despite their government's defense of nafta. a recent poll by parametría, a respected mexican pollster, found that more than two-thirds of respondents believed that nafta had benefited american consumers and businesses, while just 20 percent believed it had been good for them. the poll, consisting of 800 interviews in people's homes, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.   ''there is a grand narrative in the united states that mexico was the great winner of nafta,'' said fernando turner dávila, the secretary of the economy and labor in the industrial state of nuevo león. ''meanwhile, here in mexico, they only see the benefits, which are glorified. they never see the downsides, much less talk about them.''   mr. turner cited the loss of nearly two million jobs in the agricultural industry because of the treaty, which benefited highly subsidized industries in the united states like corn to the detriment of mexican farmers. and while the federal government lauds the increase in manufacturing exports, mexico still relies on a tremendous number of imports from the united states.   ''the mexican government has not established policies to protect mexican businesses,'' said mr. turner, himself a businessman, with factories in a half-dozen countries.   that said, even critics like mr. turner do not want to see nafta gutted. it is an imperfect deal, one that has failed to deliver on its promise, he said. but to terminate the treaty would be a disaster, he said, hurting both mexico and the united states and creating even more job losses.   after two decades, the two economies are tightly braided together. goods manufactured by companies operating in both countries -- whether speakers, cars or airplanes -- cross the border multiple times during production, a shared manufacturing process that, if destroyed, would mean shared job losses.   ''a lot of people are taking solace in the reality that it's very difficult for the u.s. to impose tariffs on mexico without damaging the u.s. economy as well,'' said christopher wilson, a scholar at the woodrow wilson institute. ''you need something to replace nafta. otherwise you're going to leave a lot of american workers out in the cold.''   the agreement has certainly brought positive changes to mexico, economists note. since it went into effect at the beginning of 1994, billions of dollars in investment has been pouring into mexico every year.   sleepy provincial towns have become manufacturing hubs. workers assemble ford fusion hybrid cars in the city of hermosillo and whirlpool refrigerators outside monterrey. tijuana sends flat-screen televisions across the border and the state of querétaro hammers out parts for helicopters and corporate jets.   for two decades, those exports have been the main driver of growth in mexico, which is why mexico's government is so eager to defend the country's trade relationship with the united states.   without the agreement, the foreign investment that creates new jobs will slow, or even vanish, some fear. mexicans got a forewarning of the possible effect this week. after poor sales and criticism from mr. trump, ford announced that it would cancel a planned car plant in san luis potosí, a state that nafta has transformed into a hub for auto manufacturing.   ''mexico has done a lot right,'' said gordon h. hanson, a trade expert at the university of california, san diego. ''it has a lot to be proud of. it has developed a middle class that lives in cities, that educates their children. it's not the mexico of 1993.''   the image of these bustling factories feeds the idea that mexico is responsible for the hollowing out of america's industrial heartland. but the reality has turned out to be much more complicated.   while american companies moved jobs to lower-wage mexico to remain competitive, some new jobs emerged in the united states, in design or engineering, or in plants to make parts for the mexican factories. in the end, ''nafta did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters,'' the congressional research service concluded in 2015.   in mexico, the hope was to mimic the success of east asia's so-called tigers, using free trade as the catalyst to modernize and overhaul the economy through exports. instead, mexico produced the exports, but not the growth. it even fell behind most other countries in latin america during the 2000s.   but nafta was not necessarily the problem. much of the misstep, experts say, was the mexican government's belief that the agreement would be enough to transform the economy all by itself. thinking of the trade deal as a panacea, the government failed to come up with a broader policy or make the investments needed to use the trade agreement as a lever to transform the whole economy.   investments in research and development, for instance, have failed to materialize in both the public and private sectors. government spending on infrastructure has dropped to its lowest level in seven decades, experts say, leaving an unreliable network of ports, highways and even internet connections across the country. burdensome regulation and corruption stifled investment, while the nation's banks lent far less than their latin american peers, leaving small companies to scramble for credit.   rodolfo de la torre, an economist with the espinosa yglesias center for studies in mexico city, said officials initially hoped nafta would bring jobs to the mass of poorly educated workers in mexico. but by the early 2000s, much of that low-skilled work had left for china, where labor was cheaper.   jobs for better-educated workers in mexico remained, in part because of the technological advances in the industrial plants.   for 10 years, jorge augustín martínez has driven a forklift for prolec, a joint venture with general electric that makes transformers. a father of two, he earns about $100 for a six-day workweek.   though he has received modest cost-of-living increases, his last raise was five years ago, when gas, food and household items were far cheaper, he said. it was also before his second son was born. between housing, insurance, savings and other requisites, he is left with about $40 a week to buy food and other necessities for his family, he said.   ''we're all the same, fighting to make ends meet,'' he said. ''i don't know anyone who is very comfortable.''	1
in the new political drama "miss sloane," jessica chastain's titular lobbyist explains how to win in washington. you have to play your last trump card, she says, right after your opponents play their last trump card. set for release on friday, the film is filled with echoes of rhetoric straight from the campaign trail. but in the aftermath of donald j. trump's presidential victory, has the story of a tough woman trying to make a difference in washington been overtaken by current events?  the filmmakers acknowledge that their project plays very differently than it would have had hillary clinton defeated mr. trump. but they say they can't control how "miss sloane" will be perceived by filmgoers and critics in light of the election outcome. "this is a movie predicated on the idea of surprise," the thriller's director, john madden ("shakespeare in love"), said last week. "but few developments could have been more surprising than the election results. for some reason, in film, being upended can be a very pleasurable experience, where in real life it often isn't." in the movie, elizabeth sloane is a ruthless conservative lobbyist who takes on the national rifle association and tries to get gun-control legislation passed. "you're going to see the film differently through the prism of what's happened, and it depends on which side of that argument you come from," mr. madden said. "but these are such extraordinarily fluid and provocative times in the world that people's interest in the political process is either completely exhausted or it's extremely heightened." and ms. chastain argued in a postelection interview: "i don't think the movie is going to play to either side of the debate. it's about a bipartisan bill, and it's a bipartisan movie." a two-hour-plus drama about a divisive issue represents a gamble in the superhero-driven marketplace, and the odds against "miss sloane" may have increased since mr. trump's victory. "i'm sure they're very nervous to be releasing a movie with an explicit political theme when the whole political landscape has suddenly changed," said the film historian peter biskind, the author of "easy riders, raging bulls," who has not seen the movie. an unexpected resonance with headlines can cut either way for a movie's box-office prospects. "the china syndrome" became a hit in 1979 after an accident at the three mile island power plant in pennsylvania moved nuclear-safety issues to the forefront. in more recent years, acts of mass violence may have depressed domestic turnout for films like "a good day to die hard," released in 2013 after the newtown, conn., school shootings. the longtime hollywood observer and author mark harris ("pictures at a revolution"), who has seen "miss sloane," said current events outrun its story in one scene. "there's a kind of wishfulness to the movie in that it assumes there are still scandals that could potentially demolish someone," mr. harris said. "there's a climactic moment in the movie that is premised on the belief that people will be shocked by what's right in front of them. after this last campaign, i'm not sure that's true." perhaps wish fulfillment isn't the worst marketing strategy for the story of a woman trying to enact huge changes in washington. "hopefully, people will feel some catharsis," ms. chastain said. "i see this movement happening now of women, minorities and other people who were surprised by the election's outcome, and the film works very well for them. it's like their fantasy world of d.c." mr. madden concurred. "the film is an act of imagination," he said. "the idea that a piece of gun legislation actually gets onto the table is far away from anything we can conceive, sadly, for the foreseeable future, or even in the last eight years. so in that respect, it is a fantasy." an experienced female insider whose ethics are questioned, miss sloane bears a passing resemblance to mrs. clinton. while that wasn't the intention, ms. chastain embraced, on behalf of her character, mr. trump's description of mrs. clinton: "such a nasty woman." "that was originally meant as an insult, then women claimed it and said, 'it's o.k. to be ambitious, strong and ruffle feathers,'" ms. chastain said. "so elizabeth is a nasty woman, because for me, a nasty woman is a powerful woman who is overprepared for a debate, knows what she's doing, is ambitious and not afraid to step forward." whatever its commercial reception, "i'm proud of the film," ms. chastain said. "elizabeth is a good representation of a woman who's a perfectionist, really good at her job, and vicious - and you can still root for her in the end." the british-born mr. madden has other reasons for optimism. when he attended a screening of the film the night after the election, "i was quite astounded there was anybody in the cinema," he said. "in my country, those of us who were not happy with the 'brexit' vote wandered around like zombies for three weeks, trying to understand the landscape we found ourselves in. i somehow imagined that might be true here. but people came to the film, and interestingly, they found it a relief." photo: jessica chastain in "miss sloane," a film in which a washington lobbyist dares to take on the national rifle association.

donald trump got within striking distance of the white house -- or, more precisely, comey-and-putin range -- thanks to overwhelming support from white working-class voters. these voters trusted his promise to bring back good manufacturing jobs while disbelieving his much more credible promise to take away their health care. they have a rude shock coming. but white workers aren't alone in their gullibility: corporate america is still in denial about the prospects for a global trade war, even though protectionism was a central theme of the trump campaign. in fact, the only two causes about which mr. trump seems truly passionate are supposedly unfair trade deals and admiration for authoritarian regimes. it's naïve to assume that he'll let his signature policy issue slide.     you might imagine that a drastic change in u.s. trade policy would require congressional approval, and that republicans -- who claim to believe in free markets -- would put on the brakes. but given g.o.p. spinelessness, that's unlikely.   in any case, the relevant legislation gives the occupant of the white house remarkable leeway should he choose to go protectionist. he can restrict imports if such imports ''threaten to impair the national security''; he can impose tariffs ''to deal with large and serious united states balance-of-payments deficits''; he can modify tariff rates when foreign governments engage in ''unjustifiable'' policies. who determines whether such conditions apply? the executive himself.   now, these provisions weren't intended to empower a president to reverse decades of u.s. trade policy, or engage in personal vendettas. you can guess, however, how much such niceties are likely to bother the incoming administration, which is already talking about using its powers. which brings us to the question of motive.   why would a trump administration impose restrictions on imports? one answer is those working-class voters, whose supposed champion is set to pursue a radically antiworker domestic agenda. there's an obvious incentive for mr. trump to make a big show of doing something to fulfill campaign promises. and if this creates international conflict, that's actually a plus when it comes to diverting attention from collapsing health care and so on.   beyond this, it's clear that the incoming commander-in-chief really believes that international trade is a game in which nice guys finish last, and that america has been taken advantage of. furthermore, he's picking advisers who will confirm him in these beliefs.   oh, and don't expect attempts by experts to point out the holes in this view -- to point out, in particular, that the image of a predatory china, running huge surpluses by keeping its currency undervalued, is years out of date -- to make any impression. members of the trump team believe that all criticism of their economic ideas reflects a conspiracy among think tanks that are out to undermine them. because of course they do.   there will be retaliation, big time. when it comes to trade, america is not that much of a superpower -- china is also a huge player, and the european union is bigger still. they will respond in kind, targeting vulnerable u.s. sectors like aircraft and agriculture.   and retaliation isn't the whole story; there's also emulation. once america decides that the rules don't apply, world trade will become a free-for-all.   will this cause a global recession? probably not -- those risks are, i think, exaggerated. no, protectionism didn't cause the great depression.   what the coming trade war will do, however, is cause a lot of disruption. today's world economy is built around ''value chains'' that spread across borders: your car or your smartphone contain components manufactured in many countries, then assembled or modified in many more. a trade war would force a drastic shortening of those chains, and quite a few u.s. manufacturing operations would end up being big losers, just as happened when global trade surged in the past.   an old joke tells of a motorist who runs over a pedestrian, then tries to fix the damage by backing up -- and runs over the victim a second time. well, the effects of the trumpist trade war on u.s. workers will be a lot like that.   given these prospects, you might think that someone will persuade the incoming administration to rethink its commercial belligerence. that is, you might think that if you have paid no attention to the record and character of the protectionist in chief. someone who won't take briefings on national security because he's ''like, a smart person'' and doesn't need them isn't likely to sit still for lessons on international economics.   follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion), and sign up for the opinion today newsletter. 	3
while attacking hillary clinton and other career politicians, donald trump took aim tuesday at two other prominent election targets: globalization and free trade. "globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very, very wealthy ... but it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache," trump said during a speech targeting free trade in a nearly shuttered former steel town in pennsylvania.  in a speech devoted to what he called "how to make america wealthy again," trump offered a series of familiar plans designed to deal with what he called "failed trade policies" -- including rejection of the proposed trans-pacific partnership (tpp) with pacific rim nations and renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement (nafta) with canada and mexico, withdrawing from it if necessary. the presumptive republican presidential nominee also said he would pursue bilateral trade agreements rather than multinational deals. trump's plans also would target one specific economic competitor: china. he vowed to label china a currency manipulator, bring it before the world trade organization and consider slapping tariffs on chinese imports coming into the u.s. clinton and other politicians, meanwhile, "watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were plunged into depression-level unemployment," trump said in a dusty old aluminum plant in monessen, part of what was once known as "the steel valley" along the monongahela river. echoing his mantra of "america first," trump vowed to use only american steel -- and aluminum -- on u.s. road, bridge, and construction projects, employing only american workers. trump attacked clinton and her husband, former president bill clinton, for past support of trade deals, including tpp. hillary clinton says she now opposes the pacific rim trade agreement and other "bad trade deals" that are hurting u.s. workers. pledging to appoint a "trade prosecutor" during a speech in ohio this week, clinton vowed to go after "unfair trade practices like when china dumps cheap steel in our markets." a prominent clinton supporter -- sen. sherrod brown of ohio -- called trump a hypocrite, saying he has benefited from trade deals that have helped him sponsor clothing lines made in other countries.  brown said trump has "high-priced accountants" who are "cashing checks from products that he's had manufactured in other countries." during his speech in a warehouse stacked with  aluminum parts, trump said clinton came out against the trans-pacific partnership only "when she saw my stance," and predicted that she would still sign the trade pact if elected to office. "her whole career, she has betrayed the american worker," he said. analysts said that trump tends to ignore the benefits of a globalized economy, including easier and increased movement of goods and services across borders that leads to greater selection and cheaper prices for consumers.	1
beijing - china's leaders have been markedly reticent about what kind of leader they think donald j. trump will be. a pragmatic dealmaker, as his business background might indicate? or a provocateur who tests the ways of statecraft? by talking on friday with taiwan's president, tsai ing-wen, mr. trump answered that question in stark terms, chinese analysts said saturday. breaking decades of american diplomatic practice, he caught the chinese government off guard by lunging into the most sensitive of its so-called core interests, the "one china" policy agreed to by president richard m. nixon more than four decades ago. "this is a wake-up call for beijing - we should buckle up for a pretty rocky six months or year in the china-u.s. relationship," wang dong, an associate professor at the school of international studies at peking university, said saturday. "there was a sort of delusion based on overly optimistic ideas about trump. that should stop."  chinese leaders covet stability in their relationship with washington, and perhaps for that reason, they have allowed fairly rosy assessments of mr. trump to appear in the state-run news media. many of those accounts have depicted the president-elect as a practical operator devoid of ideology, the kind of person china might find common ground with despite his threats of a trade war. in the hope of maintaining a relatively smooth relationship as mr. trump begins his administration, beijing will probably take a wait-and-see attitude despite his phone call with ms. tsai, said shi yinhong, a professor of international relations at renmin university. indeed, china's first official reaction, from foreign minister wang yi, was fairly benign - though it was firm in reiterating the one china policy, under which the united states formally recognized beijing as china's sole government in 1978 and broke ties with taiwan a year later. no american president or president-elect had spoken to a taiwanese president since then. mr. wang blamed ms. tsai's government for arranging the call. "it won't stand a chance to change the one china policy agreed upon by the international community," he said. a follow-up statement from the ministry of foreign affairs on saturday, noting that the ministry had filed a formal complaint with the united states government, was similar in tone. it urged "relevant parties in the u.s." to "deal with the taiwan issue in a prudent, proper manner." china's leaders disdain ms. tsai, of taiwan's democratic progressive party, who was elected president this year after pledging to wean the island off its economic dependence on china, a policy that won enthusiastic support from younger taiwanese. china favored her original opponent, hung hsiu-chu of the kuomintang, which has sought closer ties with mainland china. (ms. hung later dropped out of the race.) before the election, president xi jinping of china met with ms. tsai's predecessor, ma ying-jeou, also of the kuomintang, in the first encounter between the leaders of the two governments, a rapprochement that beijing had long sought. mr. trump broke a chinese taboo merely by using ms. tsai's title. the chinese state news media refer to the taiwanese president as the "leader of the taiwan region," to indicate that beijing regards taiwan not as a sovereign nation but as chinese territory to eventually be brought under its control. a basic tenet of the chinese government is that taiwan, where chiang kai-shek's forces fled in 1949 after losing china's civil war, will be brought back into the fold. according to mr. xi, taiwan is destined to become an integral part of his so-called china dream, a vision of an economically successful communist china astride the world. mr. trump's phone call also violated a longstanding principle of american policy: that the president does not speak to the head of taiwan's government, despite selling arms to it. "interesting how the us sells taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but i should not accept a congratulatory call," mr. trump said on twitter after the stunned reaction to his conversation with ms. tsai. though beijing vehemently protests the arms sales, it also warily acknowledges them as part of long-established practice. since the mid-1990s, washington has signaled to taiwan that it will not support any military effort to gain independence from china. the obama administration's last arms sale to taiwan, in 2015, was relatively modest - consisting of antitank missiles, two frigates and surveillance gear, worth $1.8 billion in total - but it still provoked a bitter denunciation from beijing. douglas h. paal, a former director of the american institute in taiwan, which represents american interests there, said it would not be surprising if the united states sold arms to taiwan early in the trump administration. beijing's reaction would depend on the price tag, the kinds of weapons sold and how the administration informed china of the sale, mr. paal said. while it broke diplomatic precedent, mr. trump's conversation with ms. tsai could be seen in some ways as following a pattern of republican presidents' reaching out to taiwan, although others did not do so before taking office. george w. bush, for example, was vocal in his support of taiwan early in his presidency, saying in a television interview that the united states would do "whatever it took" to defend it. his aides said afterward that the comment did not reflect a change in the one china policy. by the end of his second term, mr. bush had helped to strengthen trade ties between beijing and washington through the approval of china's entry into the world trade organization. though mr. trump has received generally favorable coverage in the state news media, some chinese analysts have expressed irritation with him, and some have suggested that his administration will offer china opportunities to show strength. yan xuetong, a professor of international relations at tsinghua university and a foreign policy hawk, said the overall tenor of the china-united states relationship in the coming years would depend a great deal on the personal chemistry between mr. trump and mr. xi. he said china, with its growing military and the second-largest economy in the world, could largely afford to act as it liked. "china is increasingly resilient to the united states," he said. shen dingli, a professor of international relations at fudan university in shanghai, took a contrarian view of mr. trump's call with ms. tsai: he said it was not a problem because mr. trump had yet to take office. "he is a private citizen," he said. but if such contacts continue after inauguration day, mr. shen said, china should end diplomatic relations with the united states. "i would close our embassy in washington and withdraw our diplomats," he said. "i would be perfectly happy to end the relationship. i don't know how you are then going to expect china to cooperate on iran and north korea and climate change. you are going to ask taiwan for that?" this article has been revised to reflect the following correction: an article on dec. 4 about china's likely re-evaluation of president-elect donald j. trump after his telephone call to taiwan's president, tsai ing-wen, referred incompletely to the presidential candidacy of hung hsui-chu of the kuomintang party. favored by china, she initially challenged ms. tsai, but later dropped out of the race. photo: president xi jinping of china takes a hard line on taiwan.

taipei, taiwan -- lin fei-fan led the charge nearly three years ago when hundreds of students occupied taiwan's legislature to protest a trade deal with china. with the island's economy increasingly tied to the mainland's, and beijing's global influence on the rise, he worried that taiwan's independence was at stake -- and might be a lost cause. now, thanks to a couple of sentences uttered by donald j. trump on a talk show, mr. lin has new hope.    the president-elect stunned the world on sunday by suggesting he might abandon the one china principle, the bedrock understanding under which the united states established relations with beijing and cut official ties with taiwan nearly four decades ago. his apparent willingness to rethink longstanding american policy that prioritizes china over taiwan has energized mr. lin, 28, and many like him. but it has also left them anxious, and asking:    what does it mean for one's homeland to be put on the table by mr. trump, an inveterate deal maker, in negotiations with china's communist leaders, who are not known for making concessions easily?   ''many people in taiwan worry that once trump takes office, he'll make a u-turn,'' mr. lin said. ''we are suspicious of his motivations.''   even as he has elevated taiwan's status by speaking on the phone with its president, mr. trump has left the impression that he sees the island primarily as leverage to extract compromises from china on other issues.   ''i don't know why we have to be bound by a one china policy unless we make a deal with china having to do with other things, including trade,'' he said, before also citing beijing's military buildup in the disputed south china sea and its support for north korea.   not since richard m. nixon traveled to beijing in 1972 to dangle the prospect of abandoning taiwan has an american leader so explicitly attempted to use it as a bargaining chip with china, which considers the self-governing island of 23 million to be part of chinese territory.   the gambit has both exhilarated and unnerved the people of taiwan, who yearn for greater international recognition but have long been worried about being sacrificed as a pawn in a geopolitical chess game.   many have applauded mr. trump's stand, describing his decision to break protocol and speak by phone with tsai ing-wen, taiwan's leader, as an overdue gesture toward one of washington's most reliable friends in asia and a young democracy. taiwan is the united states' ninth-largest trading partner and has purchased more than $46 billion in american weapons since 1990.   but residents are also coming to grips with the reality that their most vocal champion on the world stage now is a businessman known for his love of cutting deals and his erratic approach to policy making.   ''he's an uncontrollable force,'' said hsu tse-mei, 57, a retired bank manager in taipei. ''we're caught between two powerful countries, china and the united states, and we're at the mercy of trump.''   the stakes are high and help explain why mr. trump's predecessors have generally left the one china policy untouched.   since the nationalist government under chiang kai-shek fled to taiwan in 1949 after the communist revolution, generations of chinese leaders have vowed to reunify the island with the mainland and threatened war to prevent it from formally declaring independence. in the mid-1990s, china fired missiles into waters off taiwan in an attempt to intimidate supporters of a formal separation.   when the united states established relations with china in 1979, dropping its official recognition of the nationalist, or kuomintang, government in taiwan, it secured a pledge from beijing that its ''fundamental policy'' was to pursue reunification by peaceful means.   many in taiwan are now afraid that china could reconsider that commitment if mr. trump scraps the one china policy.   ''i'm worried that china may take military action against taiwan,'' said li meng-chieh, 33, a graphic designer in taipei. ''if that happens, it will derail our current way of life.''   such worries extend even to supporters of president tsai, whose democratic progressive party has long favored greater independence from the mainland and has traditionally been willing to accept greater risks to pursue it.   ms. tsai's administration has repeatedly assured china of its desire to maintain the status quo, and lo chih-cheng, a lawmaker from her party, said officials in taiwan had avoided playing up the phone call with mr. trump so as not to antagonize beijing.   ''we have tried to behave ourselves,'' mr. lo said. ''but obviously china was not happy about it, so they chose taiwan to blame. they used taiwan as a scapegoat to divert their domestic discontent.''   jason hu, a vice chairman of the opposition nationalist party, said initial excitement over the phone call had become regret. ''it's a big power play that taiwan should not be involved in,'' he said.   taiwanese society is deeply divided on the issue of closer relations with the mainland. some see the island's prosperity as inextricably linked to china, while others are worried that taiwan is already too dependent on the chinese economy and thus vulnerable to pressure from beijing. but few in taiwan are interested in reunification under china's authoritarian political system.   the chinese leadership is worried mr. trump will make its goal of reunification even more difficult to achieve and embolden those in taiwan who want to pursue greater international recognition and a more formal break with the mainland.   the government in beijing has ratcheted up its criticism of mr. trump in recent days, including with an editorial in a state-run newspaper that called him ''as ignorant as a child'' on foreign policy and suggested china might offer military assistance to american enemies in retaliation.   but china is likely to lash out against taiwan first. ''the chinese can punish taiwan and get away with it,'' said steve tsang, director of the china institute at the school of oriental and african studies in london, ''but they can't do that to the trump administration.''   when mr. nixon met with mao zedong and zhou enlai, he hoped to use the prospect of a break with taiwan and normalization of relations with beijing to drive a wedge between china and the soviet union and secure china's help in ending the vietnam war. but president xi jinping of china has taken a hard line against independence for taiwan and hong kong and may not have much room to maneuver given rising nationalist sentiment in the party and the broader public.   analysts said it would be politically difficult for mr. xi to offer concessions on trade or security issues in the face of mr. trump's statements on the one china policy, which beijing has long portrayed as nonnegotiable and the prerequisite for cooperation on other issues.   ''this will put xi jinping under pressure at home,'' said su chi, chairman of the taipei forum, a nonpartisan think tank, and a former official in the nationalist party, which favors closer ties with the mainland. ''he will have to take action to show that he can't be played around and taken advantage of by the taiwanese president.''   other republican presidents who have expressed support for taiwan -- ronald reagan pledged to continue arms sales indefinitely, and george w. bush vowed to do ''whatever it took'' to defend the island if attacked by china -- generally did so in ideological terms, supporting its evolution into the world's only chinese democracy.   but mr. trump has not made such statements, and that has prompted many in taiwan to question the health of the island's relationship with the united states.   some argue that mr. trump's approach should be a sign that taiwan cannot rely on washington and needs to strengthen ties with other countries in asia.   others say that he has presented taiwan with a chance to expand trade with the united states and build support among the american public.   ''we need to talk to the american people so they can have a deeper understanding of taiwan. we want to tell them that we are their true ally and that we share many common values,'' said huang kuo-chang, chairman of the new power party, which emerged from the student protests in 2014 that successfully blocked the trade deal with china.   mr. lin, the student protest leader, said mr. trump had opened a potential path for taiwan to gain the international recognition that he and others have been fighting so long for.   but sitting at a taipei cafe behind a laptop computer with a sticker that read, ''when dictatorship is a fact, revolution is a duty,'' mr. lin also acknowledged that mr. trump was an unlikely and perhaps unreliable ally.   ''we are not naïve,'' he said. ''we don't believe that the election of a new u.s. president will necessarily bring about huge changes. but if there's an opportunity, we will definitely not give it up.''	2
the following is a complete transcript of a news conference that president-elect donald j. trump held in new york on wednesday, as prepared by the federal news service.  sean spicer: morning. thanks for being here (inaudible) days away from the inauguration of the next president and vice president of the united states. it's an opportunity to be here today to allow the president-elect to take your questions. after the president-elect makes some remarks, he will introduce ms. sheri dillon, a prominent attorney in washington, d.c., with the prestigious firm of morgan lewis who will - who structured the agreements pursuant to the president's business arrangements and she will give brief remarks. before we start, i want to bring your attention to a few points on the report that was published in buzzfeed last night. it's frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog that was openly hostile to the president-elect's campaign to drop highly salacious and flat-out false information on the internet just days before he takes the oath of office.  according to buzzfeed's own editor, there are some serious reasons to doubt the allegations in the report. the executive editor of the new york times also dismissed the report by saying it was, quote, "totally unsubstantiated, echoing the concerns that many other reporters expressed on the internet." spicer: the fact that buzzfeed and cnn made the decision to run with this unsubstantiated claim is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks. the report is not an intelligence report, plain and simple. one issue that the report talked about was the relationship of three individuals associated with the campaign. these three individuals; paul manafort, michael cohen and carter page. carter page is an individual who the president-elect does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign. paul manafort has adamantly denied any of this involvement and michael cohen, who is said to have visited prague in august and september did not leave or enter the united states during this time. we asked him to produce his passport to confirm his whereabouts on the dates in question and there was no doubt that he was not in prague. in fact, mr. cohen has never been in prague. a new report actually suggests that michael cohen was at - at the university of southern california with his son at a baseball game. one report now suggested apparently it's another michael cohen. for all the talk lately about fake news, this political witch hunt by some in the media is based on some of the most flimsy reporting and is frankly shameful and disgraceful. pence: we are nine days away from the inauguration of the 45th president of the united states of america. i am profoundly honored and humbled that i will take the oath of office to serve as vice president of the united states nine days from today, but i'm even more honored to stand shoulder to shoulder with a new president who will make america great again. now, the president-elect's leadership and his energy during the campaign was impressive. but as the chairman of the transition effort, i can assure the american people that his energy and his vision during the course of this transition has been even more inspiring. to see the way he has brought together men and women of extraordinary capability at a historic pace in this cabinet. nineteen of the 21 cabinet officials have been announced, nine committee hearings already scheduled, seven more soon to go on the books in the next several days and it is a - it is a compilation of men and women with an unprecedented caliber of leadership and background to help this administration move our nation forward. perhaps that's why there's been such a concerted effort by some in the mainstream media to delegitimize this election and to demean our incoming administration. you know, i have long been a supporter of a free and independent press and i always will be. but with freedom comes responsibility. and the irresponsible decision of a few news organizations to run with a false and unsubstantiated report, when most news organizations resisted the temptation to propagate this fake news, can only be attributed to media bias and attempt to demean the president-elect and our incoming administration and the american people are sick and tired of it. but today, we'll get back to real news, to real facts and the real progress our incoming president has already made in reviving the american economy and assembling a team that will make america great again. and we'll hear from the president-elect about issues that are of paramount importance to the american people today. so, it is my honor to introduce to all of you, my friend and the president-elect of the united states of america, donald trump. it's very familiar territory, news conferences, because we used to give them on an almost daily basis. i think we probably maybe won the nomination because of news conferences and it's good to be with you. trump: we stopped giving them because we were getting quite a bit of inaccurate news, but i do have to say that - and i must say that i want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies? who knows, but maybe the intelligence agencies which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that. a tremendous blot, because a thing like that should have never been written, it should never have been had and it should certainly never been released. but i want to thank a lot of the news organizations for some of whom have not treated me very well over the years - a couple in particular - and they came out so strongly against that fake news and the fact that it was written about by primarily one group and one television station. so, i just want to compliment many of the people in the room. i have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that. but i will tell you, there were some news organizations with all that was just said that were so professional - so incredibly professional, that i've just gone up a notch as to what i think of you. ok? all right. we've had some great news over the last couple of weeks. i've been quite active, i guess you could say, in an economic way for the country. a lot of car companies are going to be moving in, we have other companies - big news is going to be announced over the next couple of weeks about companies that are getting building in the midwest. you saw yesterday fiat chrysler; big, big factory going to be built in this country as opposed to another country. ford just announced that they stopped plans for a billion dollar plant in mexico and they're going to be moving into michigan and expanding, very substantially, an existing plant. i appreciate that from ford. i appreciate it very much from fiat chrysler. i hope that general motors will be following and i think they will be. i think a lot of people will be following. i think a lot of industries are going to be coming back. we've got to get our drug industry back. our drug industry has been disastrous. they're leaving left and right. they supply our drugs, but they don't make them here, to a large extent. and the other thing we have to do is create new bidding procedures for the drug industry because they're getting away with murder. pharma, pharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power and there's very little bidding on drugs. we're the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don't bid properly and we're going to start bidding and we're going to save billions of dollars over a period of time. and we're going to do that with a lot of other industries. i'm very much involved with the generals and admirals on the airplane, the f-35, you've been reading about it. and it's way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget. i don't like that. and the admirals have been fantastic, the generals have been fantastic. i've really gotten to know them well. and we're going to do some big things on the f-35 program, and perhaps the f-18 program. and we're going to get those costs way down and we're going to get the plane to be even better. and we're going to have some competition and it's going to be a beautiful thing. so, we've been very, very much involved, and other things. we had jack ma, we had so many incredible people coming here. there are no - they're going to do tremendous things - tremendous things in this country. and they're very excited. and i will say, if the election didn't turn out the way it turned out, they would not be here. they would not be in my office. they would not be in anybody else's office. they'd be building and doing things in other countries. so, there's a great spirit going on right now. a spirit that many people have told me they've never seen before, ever. we're going to create jobs. i said that i will be the greatest jobs producer that god ever created. and i mean that, i really - i'm going to work very hard on that. we need certain amounts of other things, including a little bit of luck, but i think we're going to do a real job. and i'm very proud of what we've done. and we haven't even gotten there yet. i look very much forward to the inauguration. it's going to be a beautiful event. we have great talent, tremendous talent. and we have the - all of the bands - or most of the bands are from the different - from the different segments of the military. and i've heard some of these bands over the years, they're incredible. we're going to have a very, very elegant day. the 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special; very beautiful. and i think we're going to have massive crowds because we have a movement. trump: it's a movement like the world has never seen before. it's a movement that a lot of people didn't expect. and even the polls - although some of them did get it right, but many of them didn't. and that was a beautiful scene on november 8th as those states started to pour in. and we focused very hard in those states and they really reciprocated. and those states are gonna have a lot of jobs and they're gonna have a lot of security. they're going to have a lot of good news for their veterans. and by the way, speaking of veterans, i appointed today the head secretary of the veterans administration, david shulkin. and we'll do a news release in a little while. tell you about david, he's fantastic - he's fantastic. he will do a truly great job. one of the commitments i made is that we're gonna straighten out the whole situation for our veterans. our veterans have been treated horribly. they're waiting in line for 15, 16, 17 days, cases where they go in and they have a minor early-stage form of cancer and they can't see a doctor. by the time they get to the doctor, they're terminal. not gonna happen, it's not gonna happen. so, david is going to do a fantastic job. we're going to be talking to a few people also to help david. and we have some of the great hospitals of the world going to align themselves with us on the veterans administration, like the cleveland clinic, like the mayo clinic, a few more than we have. and we're gonna set up a - a group. these are hospitals that have been the top of the line, the absolute top of the line. and they're going to get together with their great doctors - dr. toby cosgrove, as you know from the cleveland clinic, has been very involved. ike perlmutter has been very, very involved, one of the great men of business. and we're gonna straighten out the v.a. for our veterans. i've been promising that for a long time and it's something i feel very, very strongly. so, you'll get the information on david. and i think you'll be very impressed with the job he does. we looked long and hard. we interviewed at least 100 people, some good, some not so good. but we had a lot of talent. and we think this election will be something that will, with time - with time, straighten it out and straighten it out for good 'cause our veterans have been treated very unfairly. a couple of aspects of the intelligence briefing that you received on friday that we're looking for further clarification on. question: first of all, did the heads of the intelligence agencies provide you with the two-page summary of these unsubstantiated allegations? and secondly to that, on the broader picture, do you accept their opinion that vladimir putin ordered the hack of the dnc and the attempted hack of the rnc? and if you do, how will that color your attempts to build a relationship with a leader who has been accused of committing an act of espionage against the united states? trump: ok, first of all, these readings as you know are confidential, classified. so, i'm not allowed to talk about what went on in a meeting. and - but we had many witnesses in that meeting, many of them with us. and i will say, again, i think it's a disgrace that information would be let out. i saw the information; i read the information outside of that meeting. it's all fake news. it's phony stuff. it didn't happen. and it was gotten by opponents of ours, as you know, because you reported it and so did many of the other people. it was a group of opponents that got together - sick people - and they put that crap together. so, i will tell you that not within the meeting, but outside of the meeting, somebody released it. it should have never been - number one, shouldn't have even entered paper. but it should have never have been released. but i read what was released and i think it's a disgrace. i think it's an absolute disgrace. as far as hacking, i think it was russia. but i think we also get hacked by other countries and other people. and i - i can say that you know when - when we lost 22 million names and everything else that was hacked recently, they didn't make a big deal out of that. that was something that was extraordinary. that was probably china. we had - we had much hacking going on. and one of the things we're gonna do, we have some of the greatest computer minds anywhere in the world that we've assembled. you saw just a sample of it two weeks ago up here where we had the six top people in the world - they were never in the same room together as a group. and we're gonna put those minds together and we're going to form a defense. trump: and i have to say this also, the democratic national committee was totally open to be hacked. they did a very poor job. they could've had hacking defense, which we had. and i will give reince priebus credit, because when reince saw what was happening in the world and with this country, he went out and went to various firms and ordered a very, very strong hacking defense. question: ... just to the last part of that question (inaudible) how could all of this potentially color your attempts to build a better relationship with president putin? trump: well, you know, president putin and russia put out a statement today that this fake news was indeed fake news. they said it totally never happened. and i - i'll be honest, i think if he did have something, they would've released it; they would've been glad to release it. i think, frankly, had they broken into the republican national committee, i think they would've released it just like they did about hillary and all of the horrible things that her people, like mr. podesta, said about her. i mean what he said about her was horrible. if somebody said about me, what podesta said about hillary, i was the boss, i would've fired him immediately or that person. because what he said about her was horrible. but remember this: we talk about the hacking and hacking's bad and it shouldn't be done. but look at the things that were hacked, look at what was learned from that hacking. that hillary clinton got the questions to the debate and didn't report it? that's a horrible thing. that's a horrible thing. can you imagine that if donald trump got the questions to the debate - it would've been the biggest story in the history of stories. and they would've said immediately, "you have to get out of the race." nobody even talked about it. it's a very terrible thing. on that intelligence report, the second part of their conclusion was that vladimir putin ordered it because he aspired to help you in the election. do you accept that part of the finding? and will you undo what president obama did to punish the russians for this or will you keep it in place? trump: well, if - if putin likes donald trump, i consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with russia. russia can help us fight isis, which, by the way, is, number one, tricky. i mean if you look, this administration created isis by leaving at the wrong time. the void was created, isis was formed. now, i don't know that i'm gonna get along with vladimir putin. i hope i do. but there's a good chance i won't. and if i don't, do you honestly believe that hillary would be tougher on putin than me? does anybody in this room really believe that? give me a break. question: ... make clear whether during your visits to either moscow or st. petersburg, you engaged in conduct that you now regret and that a reasonable... question: would a reasonable observer say that you are potentially vulnerable to blackmail by russia or by its intelligence agencies? and i always tell them - anywhere, but i always tell them if i'm leaving this country, "be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go, you're gonna probably have cameras." i'm not referring just to russia, but i would certainly put them in that category. and number one, "i hope you're gonna be good anyway. but in those rooms, you have cameras in the strangest places. cameras that are so small with modern technology, you can't see them and you won't know. you better be careful, or you'll be watching yourself on nightly television." i was in russia years ago, with the miss universe contest, which did very well - moscow, the moscow area did very, very well. and i told many people, "be careful, because you don't wanna see yourself on television. cameras all over the place." question: ... how you plan to disentangle yourself from your business. but first, i have to follow-up on some of these russian remarks. based on your comments here today, do you believe the hacking was justified? does russia have any leverage over you, financial or otherwise? and if not, will you release your tax returns to prove it? trump: so i tweeted out that i have no dealings with russia. i have no deals that could happen in russia, because we've stayed away. and i have no loans with russia. as a real estate developer, i have very, very little debt. i have assets that are - and now people have found out how big the company is, i have very little debt - i have very low debt. but i have no loans with russia at all. and i thought that was important to put out. i certified that. so i have no deals, i have no loans and i have no dealings. we could make deals in russia very easily if we wanted to, i just don't want to because i think that would be a conflict. so i have no loans, no dealings, and no current pending deals. now, i have to say one other thing. over the weekend, i was offered $2 billion to do a deal in dubai with a very, very, very amazing man, a great, great developer from the middle east, hussein damack, a friend of mine, great guy. and i was offered $2 billion to do a deal in dubai - a number of deals and i turned it down. i didn't have to turn it down, because as you know, i have a no-conflict situation because i'm president, which is - i didn't know about that until about three months ago, but it's a nice thing to have. but i don't want to take advantage of something. i have something that others don't have, vice president pence also has it. i don't think he'll need it, i have a feeling he's not going to need it. but i have a no conflict of interest provision as president. it was many, many years old, this is for presidents. because they don't want presidents getting - i understand they don't want presidents getting tangled up in minutia; they want a president to run the country. so i could actually run my business, i could actually run my business and run government at the same time. i don't like the way that looks, but i would be able to do that if i wanted to. i would be the only one to be able to do that. you can't do that in any other capacity. but as president, i could run the trump organization, great, great company, and i could run the company - the country. i'd do a very good job, but i don't want to do that. question: (inaudible) do you believe the hacking was justified? and will you release your tax returns to prove what you're saying about no deals in russia? question: ... since the '70's has had a required audit from the irs, the last place to release them, but as president sir... trump: you know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, ok? they're the only who ask. trump: no i don't think so. i won, when i became president. no, i don't think they care at all. i don't think they care at all. trump: i think you care - i think you care. first of all, you learn very little to a tax return. what you should go down to federal elections and take a look at the numbers. and actually, people have learned a lot about my company and now they realize, my company is much bigger, much more powerful than they ever thought. we're in many, many countries, and i'm very proud of it. and what i'm going to be doing is my two sons, who are right here, don and eric, are going to be running the company. they are going to be running it in a very professional manner. they're not going to discuss it with me. again, i don't have to do this. they're not going to discuss it with me. and with that, i'm going to bring up sheri dillon, and she's going to go - these papers are just some of the many documents that i've signed turning over complete and total control to my sons. dillon: good morning. it's my honor and privilege to be here today at president-elect trump's request. he's asked me, as you just heard, to speak about the conflicts of interest and the steps he's taking. as you know, the business empire built by president-elect trump over the years is massive, not dissimilar to the fortunes of nelson rockefeller when he became vice president. but at that time, no one was so concerned. president-elect trump wants the american public to rest assured that all of his efforts are directed to pursuing the people's business and not his own. to that end, as he explained a few moments ago, he directed me and my colleagues at the law firm morgan lewis and bockius to design a structure for his business empire that will completely isolate him from the management of the company. he further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the american people the decisions he makes and the actions that he takes as president are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests. dillon: as he said, he's voluntarily taking this on. the conflicts of interest laws simply do not apply to the president or the vice president and they are not required to separate themselves from their financial assets. the primary conflicts of interest statutes and some have questioned it, is section 18 usc 208 and it's simply inapplicable by its terms. and this is not just our interpretation. it's congress itself who have made this clear in 1989 when it amended section 18 usc 202 to state that, except as otherwise provided, the terms office and employee in section 208 shall not include the president. even so, president-elect trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the american public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests. he instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit. he also sought the guidance of individuals who are familiar with and have worked extensively in the fields of government ethics and constitutional law. critical to the morgan lewis team is fred fielding, standing here to our side and with us today and many of you have known him. he has served several presidents over the years including serving as counsel to presidents ronald reagan and george w. bush as well as serving on president george h.w. bush's commission on federal ethics law reform and he also held the position of vice chair of the ethics resource center. mr. fielding has been extensively involved with and approved this plan. he's here today to support the plan and he will continue to provide guidance as the plan is implemented and as eric, don, along with others, take over management of the trump organization. i'm gonna detail some of the extraordinary steps now that the president-elect is taking. first, president-elect trump's investments and business assets commonly known as the - as the trump organization, comprising hundreds of entities which, again, if you all go and take a look at his financial disclosure statement, the pages and pages and pages of entities have all been or will be conveyed to a trust prior to january 20th. here is just some of the paperwork that's taking care of those actions. second, through the trust agreement, he has relinquished leadership and management of the trump organization to his sons don and eric and a longtime trump executive, allen weisselberg. together, don, eric and allen will have the authority to manage the trump organization and will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by president-elect trump. further, at the president-elect's direction, the trust agreement provides - that to ensure the trump organization continues to operate in accordance with the highest and legal ethics standards, an ethics adviser will be appointed to the management team. the written approval of the ethics adviser will be required for new deals, actions, and transactions that could potentially raise ethics or conflicts of interest concerns. president-elect trump as well as don, eric and allen are committed to ensuring that the activities of the trump organization are beyond reproach and cannot be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the presidency. president-elect trump will resign from all officer and other positions he holds with the trump organization entities. further, in addition, his daughter ivanka will have no further involvement with or management authority whatsoever with the trump organization. as she and jared move their family to d.c., ivanka will focused on settling her children into their new homes and their new schools. the president-elect has also already disposed of all of his investments in publicly traded or easily liquidated investments. as a result, the trust will have two types of assets; first, it will hold liquid assets. cash, cash equivalents and treasuries and perhaps some positions in a government approved diversified portfolio, one that is consistent with the regulations from the office of government ethics. second, the trust is going to hold his preexisting illiquid, but very valuable business assets, the ones that everyone here is familiar with. trump owned, operated and branded golf clubs, commercial rental property, resorts, hotels, rights to royalties from preexisting licenses of trump-marks productions and goods. things like trump tower, mar-a-lago, all of his other business assets, 40 wall street will all be in the trust. through instructions in the trust agreement, president-elect trust - president-elect trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated. this impacted more than 30 deals, many of which were set to close by the end of 2016. as you can well imagine, that caused an immediate financial loss of millions of dollars, not just for president-elect trump, but also for don, ivanka and eric. dillon: the trust agreement as directed by president trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals. no new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of president trump's presidency. new domestic deals will be allowed, but they will go through a vigorous vetting process. the president-elect will have no role in deciding whether the trump organization engages in any new deal and he will only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on tv. because any new deal could - and i emphasize could - be perceived as causing a conflict or as exploiting the office of the presidency, new deals must be vetted with the ethics adviser, whose role will be to analyze any potential transactions for conflicts and ethics issues. the ethics adviser will be a recognized expert in the field of government experts. again, his role will be to scrutinize the new deals and the actions, and any new deal must receive written approval. to further reinforce the wall that we are building between president-elect trump and the trump organization, president-elect trump has ordered, through his trust agreement, to sharply limit his information rights. reports will only be available and reflect profit and loss on the company as a whole. there will be no separate business by business accounting. another step that president-elect trump has taken is he created a new position at the trump organization; the position of chief compliance counsel, whose responsibility will be to ensure that the trump businesses, again, are operating at the highest levels of integrity and not taking any actions that could be perceived as exploiting the office of the presidency. he has also directed that no communications of the trump organization, including social media accounts, will reference or be tied to president-elect trump's role as president of the united states or the office of the presidency. in sum, all of these actions - complete relinquishment of management, no foreign deals, ethics adviser approval of deals, sharply limited information rights - will sever president-elect trump's presidency from the trump organization. some have asked questions. why not divest? why not just sell everything? form of blind trust. and i'd like to turn to addressing some of those questions now. selling, first and foremost, would not eliminate possibilities of conflicts of interest. in fact, it would exacerbate them. the trump brand is key to the value of the trump organization's assets. if president-elect trump sold his brand, he would be entitled to royalties for the use of it, and this would result in the trust retaining an interest in the brand without the ability to assure that it does not exploit the office of the presidency. further, whatever price was paid would be subject to criticism and scrutiny. was it too high, is there pay for play, was it too much pay to curry favor with the president-elect. and selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale. president-elect trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built. this plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the american people, and selling the entire trump organization isn't even feasible. some people have suggested that the president-elect sell the business to his adult children. this would require massive third-party debt sourced with multiple lenders, whose motives and willingness to participate would be questioned and undoubtedly investigated. and if the president-elect were to finance the sale himself, he would retain the financial interests in the assets that he owns now. some people have suggested that the trump - that president-elect trump could bundle the assets and turn the trump organization into a public company. anyone who has ever gone through this extraordinarily cumbersome and complicated process knows that it is a non-starter. it is not realistic and it would be inappropriate for the trump organization. some people have suggested a blind trust, but you cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses. president trump can't unknow he owns trump tower and the press will make sure that any new developments at the trump organization are well publicized.dillon: further, it would be impossible to find an institutional trustee that would be competent to run the trump organization. the approach that he is taking allows don and eric to preserve this great company and its iconic assets. and this approach is best from a conflicts and ethics perspective. it creates a complete separation from president-elect trump - it separates him and prevents him from participating in the business and poses strict limits on what the trustees can do and requires the assent of any ethics adviser to a new deal. i'm going to turn to one last topic today that has been of interest lately called emoluments. that's a word i think we've all become familiar with and perhaps had not heard before. and we're gonna describe some other actions that president-elect trump is taking to avoid even the appearance of a conflict. emoluments comes from the constitution. the constitution says "officials may not accept gifts, titles of nobility, or emoluments from foreign governments with respect to their office, and that no benefit should be derived by holding in office." the so-called emoluments clause has never been interpreted, however, to apply to fair value exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office holder. no one would have thought when the constitution was written that paying your hotel bill was an emolument. instead, it would have been thought of as a value-for-value exchange; not a gift, not a title, and not an emolument. but since president-elect trump has been elected, some people want to define emoluments to cover routine business transactions like paying for hotel rooms. they suggest that the constitution prohibits the businesses from even arm's-length transactions that the president-elect has absolutely nothing to do with and isn't even aware of. these people are wrong. this is not what the constitution says. paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. it's not an emolument. the constitution does not require president-elect trump to do anything here. but, just like with conflicts of interests, he wants to do more than what the constitution requires. so, president-elect trump has decided, and we are announcing today, that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotel to the united states treasury. this way, it is the american people who will profit. in sum, i and president-elect's (sic) other advisers at morgan lewis have determined the approach we've outlined today will avoid potential conflicts of interests or concerns regarding exploitation of the office of the presidency without imposing unnecessary and unreasonable loses on the president-elect and his family. we believe this structure and these steps will serve to accomplish the president-elect's desire to be isolated from his business interests and give the american people confidence that his sole business and interest is in making america great again, bringing back jobs to this country, securing our borders and rebuilding our infrastructure. the american people were well - well aware of president-elect trump's business empire and financial interests when they voted. many people voted for him precisely because of his business success. what is your response to your critics that say not only you, but also your cabinet is filled with conflicts of interest? and do you plan to set an example in the future to make sure that your - your cabinet and everyone throughout your administration... trump: i - i really think that when you watch what's going on with what's happening in - i was just watching, as an example, rex tillerson. i think it's brilliant what he's doing and what he's saying. i watched yesterday, as you know, our great senator, who is going to be a great attorney general. and he was brilliant. and what people don't know is that he was a great prosecutor and attorney general in alabama. and he was brilliant yesterday. so, i really think that they are - i think we have one of the great cabinets ever put together. and we've been hearing that from so many people. people are so happy. you know, in the case of rex, he ran incredibly exxon mobil. when there was a find, he would get it. when they needed something, he would be there. a friend of mine who's very, very substantial in the oil business, harold hamm - big supporter - he said there's nobody in the business like rex tillerson. i want to bring the greatest people into government, because we're way behind. we don't make good deals any more. i say it all the time in speeches. we don't make good deals anymore; we make bad deals. our trade deals are a disaster.trump: we have hundreds of billions of dollars of losses on a yearly basis - hundreds of billions with china on trade and trade imbalance, with japan, with mexico, with just about everybody. we don't make good deals anymore. so we need people that are smart, we need people that are successful and they got successful because generally speaking, they're smart. and that's what i'd put, i'm very proud of the cabinet, i think they're doing very well. question: can you be specific on what guidance you're giving congressional republicans on the timeline for repeal and replace, whether it needs to be simultaneous or... question: (off-mike) though if you have outlined a plan for what you want the replace package to look like, would it guarantee coverage for those who have gotten health insurance through the current obamacare law? trump: you're gonna be very, very proud, as not only the media and reporters, you're gonna be very proud of what we put forth having to do with health care. obamacare is a complete and total disaster. they can say what they want, they can guide you anyway they wanna guide you. in some cases, they guide you incorrectly. in most cases, you realize what's happened, it's imploding as we sit. some states have over a hundred percent increase and '17 and i said this two years ago, '17 is going to be the bad year. it's going to be catastrophic. frankly, we could sit back and it was a thought from a political standpoint, but it wouldn't be fair to the people. we could sit back and wait and watch and criticize and we could be a chuck schumer and sit back and criticize it and people would come, they would come, begging to us please, we have to do something about obamacare. we don't wanna own it, we don't wanna own it politically. they own it right now. so the easiest thing would be to let it implode in '17 and believe me, we'd get pretty much whatever we wanted, but it would take a long time. we're going to be submitting, as soon as our secretary's approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan. it'll be repeal and replace. it will be essentially, simultaneously. it will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour. so we're gonna do repeal and replace, very complicated stuff. and we're gonna get a health bill passed, we're gonna get health care taken care of in this country. you have deductibles that are so high, that after people go broke paying their premiums which are going through the roof, the health care can't even be used by them because their deductibles bills are so high. obamacare is the democrats problem. we are gonna take the problem off the shelves for them. we're doing them a tremendous service by doing it. we could sit back and let them hang with it. we are doing the democrats a great service. so as soon as our secretary is approved and gets into the office, we'll be filing a plan. and it was actually, pretty accurately reported today, the new york times. and the plan will be repeal and replace obamacare. question: president-elect trump, jon steinberg (ph) from cheddar. when you look at all the meetings that you've had with carrier, softbank and alibaba, do you conceive of making this a program, maybe sitting inside of commerce? and then my follow-up question to that, is how soon will we see the program on capital repatriation and corporate tax cuts? trump: well, if i can save jobs, for instance i was doing individual companies and people said well, that's only one company, like we did a good job with carrier. and i wanna thank united technologies which owns carrier, but we saved close to a thousand jobs. and they were gone and mike pence and his staff really helped us, a lot. but those were - that was a tough one because they announced a year and a half before that they were leaving so it's always tough when they're building a plan, just a little tougher than before they start or before they make an announcement.trump: so i wanna thank united technologies. but we've been meeting with a lot of companies. but what really is happening, is the word is now out, that when you want to move your plant to mexico or some other place, and you want to fire all of your workers from michigan and ohio and all these places that i won, for good reason, it's not going to happen that way anymore. you want to move your plant and you think, as an example, you're going to build that plant in mexico and you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or whatever you're making, and you're going to sell it through what will be a very, very strong border - not a weak border like it is - we don't even have a border. it's an open sieve. but you're going to sell through a very strong border - not going to happen. you're going to pay a very large border tax. so if you want to move to another country and if you want to fire all of our great american workers that got you there in the first place, you can move from michigan to tennessee and to north carolina and south carolina. you can move from south carolina back to michigan. you can do anywhere - you've got a lot of states at play; a lot of competition. so it's not like, oh, gee, i'm taking the competition away. you've got a lot of places you can move. and i don't care, as along as it's within the united states, the borders of the united states. there will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder. and if our politicians had what it takes, they would have done this years ago. and you'd have millions more workers right now in the united states that are - 96 million really wanting a job and they can't get. you know that story. the real number - that's the real number. question: president-elect, i have a question about the supreme court and border security. but i also wanted to ask you about something you said on twitter this morning. are we living in nazi germany? what were you driving at there? do you have a problem with the intelligence community? and on the supreme court, what's your timeline? you said a while ago you were down to four. have you conducted those interviews yet? what's your timeline for nominating? and on the border fence, it now appears clear u.s. taxpayers will have to pay for it up front. what is your plan to... on the fence - it's not a fence. it's a wall. you just misreported it. we're going to build a wall. i could wait about a year-and-a-half until we finish our negotiations with mexico, which will start immediately after we get to office, but i don't want to wait. mike pence is leading an effort to get final approvals through various agencies and through congress for the wall to begin. i don't feel like waiting a year or a year-and-a-half. we're going to start building. mexico in some form, and there are many different forms, will reimburse us and they will reimburse us for the cost of the wall. that will happen, whether it's a tax or whether it's a payment - probably less likely that it's a payment. but it will happen. so, remember this, ok? i would say we are going to build a wall and people would go crazy. i would then say, who is going to pay for the wall? and people would all scream out - 25,000, 30,000 people, because nobody has ever had crowds like trump has had. you know that. you don't like to report that, but that's ok. now, reports went out last week - oh, mexico is not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement. what's the difference? i want to get the wall started. i don't want to wait a year-and-a-half until i make my deal with mexico. and we probably will have a deal sooner than that. and by the way, mexico has been so nice, so nice. i respect the government of mexico. i respect the people of mexico. i love the people of mexico. i have many people from mexico working for me. they're phenomenal people. the government of mexico is terrific. i don't blame them for what's happened. i don't blame them for taking advantage of the united states. i wish our politicians were so smart. mexico has taken advantage of the united states. i don't blame the representatives and various presidents, et cetera, of mexico. what i say is we shouldn't have allowed that to happen. it's not going to happen anymore. supreme court judge. so, as you know, i have a list of 20. i've gone through them. we've met with numerous candidates. they're outstanding in every case. they were largely recommended and highly recommended by federalist society. jim demint was also very much involved, and his group, which is fantastic, and he's a fantastic guy.trump: so between leo and jim demint and some senators and some congresspeople, we have a great group of people. i'll be making the decision on who we will put up for justice of the united states supreme court, a replacement for the great, great justice scalia. that will be probably within two weeks of the 20th. so within about two weeks, probably the second week. i consider the first day because we'll also be doing some - some pretty good signings and i think what we'll do is we'll wait until monday. that will be our really first business day as opposed to doing it on friday, because on friday, people are going to have a very good time at the inauguration, and then saturday, as you know, we're having a big church service and lots of good things are happening. so our first day - and you'll all be invited to the signings, but we'll be doing some pretty good signings on monday and tuesday and wednesday and thursday and friday, and then also the next week. and you're all invited. but on the supreme court, i'll be making that decision, and it will be a decision which i very strongly believe in. i think it's one of the reasons i got elected. i think the people of this country did not want to see what was happening with the supreme court, so i think it was a very, very big decision as to why i was elected. question: the tweet that you had this morning about are we living in nazi germany, what were you driving at there? what are you trying to tell the american public? trump: i think it was disgraceful - disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out. i think it's a disgrace, and i say that - and i say that, and that's something that nazi germany would have done and did do. i think it's a disgrace that information that was false and fake and never happened got released to the public. as far as buzzfeed, which is a failing pile of garbage, writing it, i think they're going to suffer the consequences. they already are. and as far as cnn going out of their way to build it up - and by the way, we just found out i was coming down. michael cohen - i was being - michael cohen is a very talented lawyer. he's a good lawyer in my firm. it was just reported that it wasn't this michael cohen they we're talking about. so all night long it's michael cohen. i said, "i want to see your passport." he brings his passport to my office. i say, hey, wait a minute. he didn't leave the country. he wasn't out of the country. they had michael cohen of the trump organization was in prague. it turned out to be a different michael cohen. it's a disgrace what took place. it's a disgrace and i think they ought to apologize to start with michael cohen. question: you are attacking our news organization, can you give us a chance to ask a question, sir? sir, can you... trump: don't be rude. no, i'm not going to give you a question. i'm not going to give you a question. question: sir, can you state categorically that nobody - no, mr. president-elect, that's not appropriate. question: do you think president obama went too far with the sanctions he put on russia after the hacking? question: will you roll them back? what do you think of lindsey graham's plan to send you a bill for... trump: i hadn't heard lindsey graham was going to do that. lindsey graham. i've been competing with him for a long time. he is going to crack that one percent barrier one day. i didn't realize lindsey graham still had it. that's all right. i think lindsey graham is a nice guy. i've heard that he is a nice guy and i've been hearing it. as far as we understand it, the intelligence community are still looking at these allegations, this false news, as you describe it. if they come back with any kind of conclusion that any of it stands up, that any of it is true, will you consider your position... question: (inaudible) published fake news and all the problems that we've seen throughout the media over the course of the election, what reforms do you recommend for this industry here? you know, i've been hearing more and more about a thing called fake news and they're talking about people that go and say all sorts of things. but i will tell you, some of the media outlets that i deal with are fake news more so than anybody. i could name them, but i won't bother, but you have a few sitting right in front of us. they're very, very dishonest people, but i think it's just something we're going to have to live with.trump: i guess the advantage i have is that i can speak back. when it happens to somebody that doesn't have this - doesn't have that kind of a megaphone, they can't speak back. it's a very sad thing. i've seen people destroyed. i've seen people absolutely destroyed. and i think it's very unfair. so, all i can ask for is honest reporters. question: i just wanted to follow up on the questions about the u.s. intelligence community. and be very clear about what you're saying. do you trust your u.s. intelligence officials? and what do you say to foreign policy experts who say you're actually weakening national security by waging this war of words against that community? trump: intelligence agencies are vital and very, very important. we are going to be putting in, as you know, mr. pompeo and others, you know the senator dan coats. we're going to be putting in some outstanding people. within 90 days, they're going to be coming back to me with a major report on hacking. i want them to cover this situation. i also want them, however, to cover, maybe most importantly - because we're hacked by everybody - you know, the united states, our government out of a list of 17 in terms of industries is the worst, it's number 17, in terms of protection. if you look at the retail industry, if you look at the banking industry, various industries, out of 17 industries - they put this in the category of an industry - the united states is last in terms of protecting, let's say, hacking defense. like we had a great hacking defense at the republican national committee. that's why we weren't hacked. by the way, we were told that they were trying to hack us, but they weren't able to hack. and i think i get some credit because i told reince, and reince did a phenomenal job, but i said i want strong hacking defense. the democratic national committee didn't do that. maybe that's why the country runs so badly that way. but i will tell you - wait - wait - wait, let me finish. within 90 days, we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense, how do we stop this new phenomena - fairly new phenomena because the united states is hacked by everybody. question: mr. president-elect, you said, just now, that you believe russia indeed was responsible for the hacking of the dnc and jon podesta's e-mails, et cetera. question: but why did you spend weeks undermining u.s. intelligence community before simply getting the facts and then making a public statement? trump: well, i think it's pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press. i think it's pretty sad. first of all, it's illegal. you know, these are - these are classified and certified meetings and reports. i'll tell you what does happen. i have many meetings with intelligence. and every time i meet, people are reading about it. somebody's leaking it out. so, there's - maybe it's my office. maybe in my office because i have a lot of people, a lot of great people. maybe it's them. and what i did is i said i won't tell anybody. i'm going to have a meeting and i won't tell anybody about my meeting with intelligence. and what happened is i had my meeting. nobody knew, not even rhona, my executive assistant for years, she didn't know - i didn't tell her. nobody knew. the meeting was had, the meeting was over, they left. and immediately the word got out that i had a meeting. so, i don't want that - i don't want that. it's very unfair to the country. it's very unfair to our country; what's happened. that report should have never - first of all, it shouldn't have been printed because it's not worth the paper it's written on. and i thank the new york times for saying that. i thank a lot of different people for saying that. but, i will tell you, that should never, ever happen. ok. question: thank you, mr. president-elect, can you stand here today, once and for all and say that no one connected to you or your campaign had any contact with russia leading up to or during the presidential campaign. and if you do indeed believe that russia was behind the hacking, what is your message to vladimir putin right now? trump: he shouldn't be doing it. he won't be doing it. russia will have much greater respect for our country when i'm leading than when other people have led it. you will see that. russia will respect our country more. he shouldn't have done it. i don't believe that he will be doing it more now. we have to work something out, but it's not just russia. take a look at what's happened. you don't report it the same way; 22 million accounts were hacked in this country by china. and that's because we have no defense. that's because we're run by people that don't know what they're doing.trump: russia will have far greater respect for our country when i'm leading it and i believe and i hope - maybe it won't happen, it's possible. but i won't be giving (ph) a little reset button like hillary. here, press this piece of plastic. a guy looked at her like what is she doing? there's no reset button. we're either going to get along or we're not. i hope we get along, but if we don't, that's possible too. but russia and other countries - and other countries, including china, which has taken total advantage of us economically, totally advantage of us in the south china sea by building their massive fortress, total. russia, china, japan, mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations. i want to thank everybody. so this is all - just so you understand, these papers - because i'm not sure that was explained properly. but these papers are all just a piece of the many, many companies that are being put into trust to be run by my two sons that i hope at the end of eight years, i'll come back and say, oh, you did a good job. otherwise, if they do a bad job, i'll say, "you're fired." follow the new york times's politics and washington coverage on facebook and twitter, and sign up for the first draft politics newsletter.related articles	9
washington - president-elect donald j. trump on tuesday named as his chief trade negotiator a washington lawyer who has long advocated protectionist policies, the latest sign that mr. trump intends to fulfill his campaign promise to get tough with china, mexico and other trading partners. mr. trump also renewed his episodic campaign to persuade american companies to expand domestic manufacturing, criticizing general motors via twitter on tuesday morning for making in mexico some of the chevrolet cruze hatchbacks it sells domestically. hours later, mr. trump claimed credit after ford said it would expand vehicle production in flat rock, mich. the choice of robert lighthizer (pronounced light-hi-zer) to be the united states' trade representative nearly completes mr. trump's selection of top economic advisers and, taken together with the president-elect's running commentary on twitter, underscores mr. trump's focus on making things in america. that is causing unease among some republicans who regard mr. trump's views on trade as dangerously retrograde, even as they embrace the bulk of his economic agenda. mainstream economists warn that protectionist policies like import taxes could impose higher prices on consumers and slow economic growth.  but some democrats are signaling a readiness to support mr. trump. nine house democrats held a news conference tuesday with the a.f.l.-c.i.o. president, richard trumka, to urge renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement with mexico and canada. "we wanted him to know that we'll work with him on doing that," mr. trumka said. "i don't think he has enough republican support to do it, and rewriting the rules of trade is a necessary first step in righting the economy for working people." mr. trump and his top advisers on trade, including mr. lighthizer, share a view that the united states in recent decades prioritized the ideal of free trade over its own self-interest. they argue that other countries are undermining america's industrial base by subsidizing their own export industries while impeding american importers. they regard this unfair competition as a key reason for the lackluster growth of the economy. in picking mr. lighthizer, who has spent much of the last few decades representing american steel producers in their frequent litigation of trade disputes, mr. trump is seeking to hire one of washington's top trade lawyers to enforce international trade agreements more vigorously. he must be confirmed by the senate. "he will do an amazing job helping turn around the failed trade policies which have robbed so many americans of prosperity," mr. trump said in a statement. mainstream republicans have sought common ground with mr. trump, emphasizing, for example, the importance of enforcing trade rules, but they have not abandoned the party's longtime advocacy for trade. senator orrin hatch of utah, the chairman of the senate finance committee, which will hold hearings on mr. lighthizer's nomination, issued a cautiously supportive statement tuesday. "as the world and our economic competitors move to expand their global footprints, we can't afford to be left behind in securing strong deals that will increase our access to new markets for american-made products and services," mr. hatch said in a statement. "i look forward to a vigorous discussion of bob's trade philosophy and priorities." mr. trump has named a number of advisers on trade, leaving some ambiguity about the division of responsibilities. the president-elect named the economist peter navarro, an outspoken critic of china, to lead a new white house office overseeing trade and industrial policy. mr. trump also said wilbur ross, the billionaire investor and choice for commerce secretary, will play a key role. mr. lighthizer, however, is the only member of the triumvirate with government experience. "those who say u.s.t.r. will be subordinated to other agencies are mistaken," said alan wolff, another former senior american trade official who was the steel industry's co-counsel on trade with mr. lighthizer for nearly 20 years, citing mr. lighthizer's encyclopedic knowledge of trade law. "he'll be a dominant figure on trade, in harmony with wilbur ross and navarro." there is also an ideological divide between the people mr. trump has named to oversee trade policy and his broader circle of advisers, which is populated by longstanding trade advocates like gary d. cohn, the president of goldman sachs, who will lead the national economic council; rex w. tillerson, the chief executive of exxon mobil, tapped for secretary of state; and gov. terry branstad of iowa, mr. trump's choice for ambassador to china. proponents of trade hope the broader circle, and congressional republicans, will exert a moderating influence. "you're seeing a pretty clear indication that there will be a focus on the enforcement of our trade agreements and on the letter of the law," said scott lincicome, an international trade lawyer at white & case. "but that doesn't necessarily mean a significant turn toward protectionism. even free trade guys like me support enforcement." trade opponents on the left and the right, meanwhile, are hoping mr. trump means to break with several decades of pro-trade policy. "there's going to be a war within the trump administration on where they go with trade, and we're hoping to energize the worker base he had to make sure they go in the right direction to benefit the american worker," mr. trumka said. mr. trump's promise to immediately designate china as a currency manipulator may offer an early test of the administration's intentions. economists see no evidence china is suppressing the value of its currency, although it has done so in the past. mr. lincicome said officially labeling china a currency manipulator despite the lack of recent evidence would signal that the administration is taking a hard line on trade issues. a broader shift in trade policy would unfold more slowly. mr. trump has promised to renegotiate nafta; the original process took most of three years. he has promised to pursue enforcement actions against other nations, but it takes time to mount cases. he has threatened to impose new tariffs on imports, but sweeping changes most likely would require congressional legislation. "general motors is sending mexican made model of chevy cruze to u.s. car dealers-tax free across border," he wrote tuesday on twitter. "make in u.s.a. or pay big border tax!" general motors announced in 2015 that it would make the cruze in coahuila, mexico. american manufacturers are moving small-car production to mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs and because of declining domestic demand. they continue to build more expensive vehicles in the united states. ford's announcement tuesday does not reverse that trend. the carmaker said it still planned to move production of the compact ford focus from michigan to mexico. but it said it would invest in a different michigan plant to expand production of higher-priced vehicles, including its f-150 pickup truck and the mustang sports car, as well as a new battery-powered sport utility vehicle. "we are encouraged by the pro-growth policies that president-elect trump and the new congress have indicated they will pursue," said the company's chief executive, mark fields. mr. lighthizer served as deputy united states trade representative in the ronald reagan administration, when he was involved in pressing japan to reduce its restrictions on american imports and its subsidies for its own exports. mr. trump has criticized china for similar practices, setting the stage for a new round of confrontations. reagan is often remembered as an advocate for free trade, but his administration in its early hours imposed a quota on japanese auto imports. it was the first in a long series of measures aimed at putting pressure on the nation that was then regarded, like china in recent years, as a threat to american prosperity. "president reagan's pragmatism contrasted strongly with the utopian dreams of free traders," mr. lighthizer wrote in a 2008 piece criticizing senator john mccain, republican of arizona, for embracing "unbridled" free trade. conservatives, he argued, "always understood that trade policy was merely a tool for building a strong and independent country with a prosperous middle class." photo: robert lighthizer is the choice to become the united states' trade representative.

marrakesh, morocco -- diplomats at an annual united nations global warming summit meeting here expressed shock at the election of donald j. trump, who has called climate change a hoax and vowed to withdraw the united states from the paris climate change accord, worrying that mr. trump's presidency could cripple a decade of climate diplomacy. and some called for retaliation to compel american compliance. nicolas sarkozy, the former president of france, who is again running to lead his country, suggested imposing a carbon tariff on imports from the united states, based on the amount of carbon dioxide pollution emitted to produce various goods.    salaheddine mezouar, the moroccan foreign minister, who is presiding over the marrakesh meeting, said: ''we really want the u.s., naturally. it has a huge role, a huge weight.''    officials from the obama administration sought to reassure the world that even if mr. trump rolls back the united states' federal climate change policy, many states and electric utilities have already turned toward investing in the growing market for low-carbon energy.   the obama administration rolled out a slew of last-minute regulations since the election of mr. trump, and more are planned in the coming weeks.   ''you can't keep the waves off the beach,'' ernest j. moniz, the secretary of energy, said in an interview here, describing his message to counterparts. ''we are heading to a low-carbon economy. the train has left the station.'' .   and no government has said publicly that it will follow the united states away from the paris agreement, which committed more than 190 countries to develop plans to combat climate change. leading diplomats said they expected the pact to be followed with or without the united states.   ''the agreement is not dependent on the u.s.,'' said laurence tubiana, the french climate change envoy, who played a key role in brokering the paris deal. ''many countries have domestic rationale for wanting to reduce their emissions.''   still, she added, ''i hope president trump considers the laws of physics. climate change will not stop, even if he stops implementing the rules.''   one year ago in paris, hundreds of diplomats celebrated the new accord. president obama hoped to make the united states a leader in combating climate change, drafting the first american climate regulations and serving as a central broker of the paris deal.   this week's summit meeting was intended as a low-key follow-up to agree on details for carrying out the deal. instead, the american presidential election has taken center stage, and china, the world's largest greenhouse gas polluter, is poised to step forward as the world's new leader in climate diplomacy.   ''it is a new world order,'' erik solheim, head of the united nations environment program, said. ''leadership on climate change policy has now gone to the developing countries, china among them.''   a new analysis of carbon dioxide emissions trends published on monday concluded that planet-warming emissions had leveled off for the past three years in a row, chiefly because of a sharp reduction in china's emissions.   ''the big story is china over the last decade,'' said glen peters, a senior researcher at the center for international climate and environmental research in oslo, and co-author of the study, an annual analysis published in the journal earth system science data. ''no one expected china's emissions to grow so fast, and no one expected them to level out and come to such a sudden halt.''  china had long resisted pressure to enact plans to cut its emissions. but that changed after 2014, when president xi jinping outlined his plan to lower china's emissions by 2030. next year, mr. xi plans to start a national program to force industrial greenhouse gas emitters to pay a fee to pollute.   zou ji, deputy director general of china's national center for climate change strategy and international cooperation, which advises the government, said the paris agreement could survive despite mr. trump's election.   the leadership vacuum offers beijing ''a way of raising its status, power and leadership in the global order,'' mr. zou said.   the chinese delegation decorated the walls of its office in red banners, photographs of nature and printouts of english-language quotations about protecting the planet.   ''waves of new blood on board, we devote to the affairs of family, nation and globe, composing chapters of commitments,'' one read.   ''we have made a huge dent by playing a role in innovation and getting the rest of the world to do it,'' he said.   behind the scenes, many united states climate officials acknowledged that they remained shellshocked by the results of last week's election. plans for the white house delegation to join the governments of mexico and canada here on wednesday to detail a north american road map for aggressive emissions cuts by 2050 have been thrown into question.   after last week's election, some longtime climate policy analysts initially feared a reprise of the fate of the world's first climate change treaty -- the 1997 kyoto protocol. in kyoto, al gore, who was then vice president, pledged that the united states, the world's largest carbon polluter at the time, would enact an ambitious climate change policy. but president george w. bush withdrew the united states from the kyoto accord, and it ultimately had little impact.   but unlike kyoto, the paris deal has already entered into legal force, since more than half the nations of the world have formally ratified it.   ''there is no comparison with kyoto,'' mr. mezouar said. ''countries are now legally bound to paris. they are staying.''   still, he conceded, money is one of the crucial questions going forward. as secretary of state, hillary clinton promised the rest of the world that rich countries would mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 to help poor countries adapt to the ravages of climate change. without action by the united states, ''much of the financial contribution could be taken away,'' mr. mezouar said.   others said the impact of global warming might change mr. trump's mind. a study this week from the world meteorological organization found 2016 on track to be the hottest year on record, blowing past the records set by 2014 and 2015.

  iran warns it will destroy israel and start world war iii if donald trump tears up the nuclear deal. china calls him "as ignorant as a child" and threatens to end all cooperation if trump doesn't recognize taiwan as part of china.    then there are the hillary clinton democrats, who are trying to steal the election they lost. some fellow republicans also are breaking with the president-elect over russian hacking allegations and his selection of oilman rex tillerson for secretary of state.     if you blinked, you missed the trump honeymoon. he hasn't taken office, yet already, the long knives are out for him.     the conflicts could be trump's baptism by fire, except he ran an endless gantlet of fire during the 18-month campaign. numerous reports of his demise were not premature, they were flat-out wrong.     i suspect something similar is happening now. the whole world looks to be having a nervous breakdown over his early actions, and many americans are wondering if the wheels are about to come off the trump train. some on the left, including those in the white house, certainly hope so and are doing all they can to delegitimize his victory and undermine democracy. if only they treated america's enemies so ruthlessly.     still, the good news is that they hope and scheme in vain. trump shows no signs of going wobbly, and while he doesn't always keep calm, he does carry on.     he has taken the most vicious pounding of any candidate in modern times, and still pulled off one of the great upsets in political history. why would he buckle now?    as the late mayor ed koch once said of himself: i give ulcers, i don't get them. so it is with trump. he takes pleasure in driving his opponents crazy.    if he were the appeasing sort, he would back off now, say soothing things to make the hysterics feel better, and pledge to play nice.    fortunately, that's not the man america elected. trump is a master negotiator, and now that he has the attention of china, iran and democrats, he will try to use that as leverage to cut better deals for national security and working americans.     but trump is also a pure disrupter, the greatest threat to politics-as-usual ever to win the oval office. he may want to negotiate, or he may keep plowing ahead until he gets all that he wants.    the other party never knows which side of him they're getting. is he looking to make a deal, or does he want it all?     his life story shows examples of both. the title of his first book is "the art of the deal," but one of the most striking statements in it is this: "my style of deal-making is quite simple and straightforward. i aim very high, and then i just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what i'm after."    that's why he won the election. most of the voters in 30 states wanted change, and he was the clear change agent. but change of the magnitude they want and he seeks - wholesale change, at home and abroad - can't happen smoothly. many eggs must be broken to rearrange the power structure.    the architects of the status quo, including the mainstream media, establishment leaders of both parties, as well as hostile powers such as china and iran, have everything to lose from trump's agenda. most of his changes will come at their expense, so they can be expected to fight him all the way, as they are now.    that's fine, that's how the founders devised the separation of powers, and that's the way the world works - everybody pursues their own interests.    trump will not always prevail, or always be right. his election was an urgent course correction, but sometimes, the correction will need to be corrected. the key is for him to keep his bond with the american people by speaking directly to them, and listening to what they say in return.     remember, too, we are in the early stages of the battle for america's renewal. whatever you do, don't be a spectator. and always be prepared to be surprised.  	9
in their first verbal standoff, north korean leader kim jong un indicated his country is in the final stages of testing a missile with a nuclear weapon that can reach the united states, and president-elect donald trump has vowed that it "won't happen." trump's options for making good on that tweet sent monday include everything  from diplomacy to a pre-emptive military strike.  here are some options for dealing with the north korean nuclear threat, according to former u.s. negotiators, arms control experts and analysts who have studied the region: trump could start by trying to work with china rather than antagonize it, says chris hill, who led u.s. negotiations on north korea's nuclear program  for president george w. bush. "if there is a solution, that solution will be with china," north korea's most important ally, says hill, now dean of the josef korbel school of international studies at the university of denver. "the president-elect should be careful about picking fights with china over trade or the one-china policy because he will need a lot of his capital for north korea." since his election, trump accepted a congratulatory phone call from taiwanese president tsai ing-wen. that was a breach of u.s. policy, which does not recognize taiwan's sovereignty. (china considers taiwan a breakaway province that someday will be reunited with the mainland.) trump later questioned whether the united states "should be bound" by the "one china" policy, unless china cooperates on "other things, including trade." the "one china policy" recognizes the communist leaders in beijing as the only legitimate chinese government. "i would put cooperation with china on north korea above any efforts to change the status quo of the taiwan relationship or the (china-u.s.) trade relationship," hill says. trump could increase deterrence activities along with allies south korea and japan, says richard bush, a senior fellow at the brookings institution, a washington think tank. that means moving ahead and expanding plans to deploy the terminal high altitude area defense missile shield that president obama promised south korea, where nearly 30,000 u.s. troops are stationed. it also means expanding live-fire joint exercises with south korea and japan, which would require north korea to devote resources to monitor and respond to military activities on its borders. the u.s. also could fly more b-52 strategic bombers over north korea and engage in more operations "to influence what's going on in the public mind of north koreans," bush says. trump should offer north korea economic aid if it agrees to stop testing nuclear weapons, says james acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the carnegie endowment for international peace. the north participated in such negotiations with presidents clinton, bush and obama, and  it agreed to deals it then cheated on and abandoned. acton concedes that approach now is "unlikely to succeed," given north korea's pattern, but he says it is worth trying again. "it's the least bad of a really bad bunch of options," he says. increased sanctions on north korea is another option, but it, too, has been tried and has failed to achieve the desired result. "economic sanctions, increasing air deterrence efforts on the korean peninsula and ... encouraging china to use economic means to pressure north korea -- that package of actions and programs (is) connected to the realities we face," the brookings institution's bush says. "it also sounds a lot like the obama administration's policies." despite sanctions, north korea continues to conduct nuclear tests -- including two in 2016 -- and missile tests in violation of united nations resolutions opposing them. if trump wants to "quickly decapitate the head of the snake" and do it without mobilizing 100,000 u.s. troops to invade north korea, he could order a military strike on the capital, pyongyang, says robert kelley, a former director at the u.n.'s international atomic energy agency. kelley, a fellow at the stockholm international peace research institute, says he is not advocating a nuclear strike, but trump might consider the option. "in the short term it would remove the threat," kelley says. "presumably the nuclear weapons are located elsewhere, and commanders may have launch authority to use them in the event the leadership is destroyed," acton says. "going after kim jong un and a large part of his leadership structure doesn't necessarily remove the threat." 	9
lima, peru -- a toxic political war over money, jobs and globalization killed the vast and complex trade deal that was supposed to be a signature legacy of president obama. but the deal, between the united states and 11 asian and pacific nations, was never just about trade. the agreement, the trans-pacific partnership, was conceived as a vital move in the increasingly tense chess match between china and the united states for economic and military influence in the fastest-growing and most strategically uncertain part of the world. the deal, which excluded china, was intended to give those 11 nations more leverage in that strained match by providing them with a viable economic alternative. and its defeat is an unalloyed triumph for china, the country that president-elect donald j. trump castigated repeatedly over trade.    mr. obama, in comments just before meeting his counterparts, who laboriously negotiated the pact, made no reference to its near certain burial.   ''this is always a useful occasion for us to get together and examine how we can make sure that we're creating more jobs, more opportunity and greater prosperity for all of our countries,'' mr. obama said. ''so it's wonderful to see all of you again, and i look forward to a constructive discussion.''    in remarks during a bilateral meeting on saturday between mr. obama and president xi jinping of china, mr. xi said the relationship between their countries was at ''a hinge moment'' and added that china would work with others to ensure a successful summit meeting.   ''i hope the two sides will work together to focus on cooperation, manage our differences and make sure there is a smooth transition in the relationship, and that it will continue to grow going forward,'' he said.   mr. obama will find that his counterparts are already getting pulled deeper into china's economic riptide because of the pact's demise.   australia said on wednesday that it wanted to push ahead with a chinese-led trade pact that would cover asian nations from japan to india but exclude the united states. peru has opened talks with beijing to join the agreement as well. even american business leaders are positioning themselves for the potential opportunities in asia.   ''two-thirds of what we do there ends up in another country,'' said john g. rice, general electric's vice chairman for international operations. ''so if they're going to lower tariffs and trade barriers within that region, we'll find ways to do more there.''   much of asia has for decades quietly accepted american security guarantees while also running large trade surpluses with the united states, turning them into prosperous manufacturing powerhouses. but china is now the largest trading partner for most of the region, while at the same time making territorial claims against many of its neighbors.   the neighbors fear they could soon face a stark choice among money, pride and place: accede to china's security demands, or lose access to china's vast market.   ''the long-term question is whether america pulls back from asia and makes it easier for china to force countries in the region to make a choice between china and the united states,'' said richard bush, a senior fellow at the brookings institution.   when it comes to asia, the shift in american policy is likely to be among the most pronounced in the new administration.   born in hawaii, in the middle of the pacific ocean, and raised partly in indonesia, mr. obama has, since his earliest days as president, pushed asia as his nation's best opportunity for growth. other than efforts to end two wars begun by his predecessor, mr. obama's principal foreign policy goal was to shift the nation's attention and military resources away from an aging europe and an unproductive rivalry with russia and toward the fast-growing asia-pacific region.   it is a goal he partly shared with president george w. bush, whose administration began the negotiations for the trans-pacific partnership. mr. bush, too, saw the pact as a bulwark against china's rising strategic ambitions.   mr. obama has spent much of the last 10 days putting a brave face on the crushing blow that mr. trump's surprising electoral victory represented to his legacy.   hours after the results became clear, he told the country and his own weeping staff that ''we're all actually on one team.'' on monday, he suggested republicans would find replacing his health care law difficult. and in visits on tuesday and thursday to greece and germany, he told panicked europeans that mr. trump would preserve the nato alliance.   but the meetings this weekend, at the asia-pacific trade summit, will very likely have a more funereal feel.   more than on any other issue, mr. obama and mr. trump have diametrically opposing views on asian trade. and mr. trump has won. even white house aides have admitted to their boss's bitter defeat.   ''we're cleareyed about the current situation, but we believe what we believe about the value of trade and the importance of the asia-pacific region to the united states,'' said benjamin j. rhodes, a deputy national security adviser.   just three days before mr. obama's arrival here, peru's foreign minister, eduardo ferreyros, said the country still hoped the pacific pact would someday become a reality. but given the changing dynamics, his government also opened talks this autumn with beijing to join the rival, chinese-led trade pact, the regional comprehensive economic partnership.   ''since mr. trump is not so interested in requiring economic integration and trade liberalization, why not have other countries follow this free-trade proposal?'' asked song guoyou, a longtime trade specialist who is the deputy director of the center for american studies at fudan university in shanghai.   since the election, australia's government has also called for rapid progress in concluding that rival trade pact. even japan, despite facing territorial demands from china and close, but peaceful, confrontations between the two countries' military jets and coast guard vessels, is paying more attention to china's vision for global trade.   australia and japan have been bargaining for years with china on the deal. but they wanted it as a complement to the trans-pacific partnership, to balance their economic relationship with the united states instead of replacing it with ties to china.   ''if t.p.p. doesn't move forward, there's no doubt that the focus will shift'' to the china-led deal, prime minister shinzo abe of japan told his country's parliament on tuesday. mr. abe met with mr. trump on thursday.   since 2011, trade negotiators from china, japan, australia, india and 12 other asian nations have been meeting several times a year to stitch together the regional comprehensive economic partnership. and with mr. trump's victory, those efforts are almost certain to accelerate. the next round of talks is to be held in indonesia early next month.   trade officials across asia met to negotiate details in cebu, the philippines, the week before mr. trump won the election. almost no one noticed outside of cebu. the next meeting, scheduled for early december, could attract far more attention, including some at this weekend's asia-pacific economic cooperation summit meeting in lima.   ''everyone is waiting to see what will happen at the apec summit -- there will be a lot of discussions on the sidelines on how to deal with trump,'' said kishore mahbubani, the dean of the lee kuan yew school of public policy at the national university of singapore, said of this weekend's meeting. ''the biggest winner if you walk away from t.p.p. is china. there's no doubt about that.''	2
the stock market is a nervous animal that can easily find a reason to sell off sharply, but so far it has taken the rise of mr. trump in stride.    the standard & poor's 500 index has climbed 6 percent since super tuesday, on march 1, when mr. trump's victories showed him to be the front-runner for the republican nomination. and it has kept rising as mr. trump has built momentum and as hillary clinton has had setbacks, like the release on wednesday of a report by the state department's inspector general that was critical of her use of a private email server. the benchmark index on wednesday closed at a mere 2 percent below its record high.    the relatively high valuation of the stock market -- it's trading at 20 times historical earnings -- indicates that investors don't see any big threats from his stated policies.   ''how much do you think he will get enacted?'' said jim paulsen, chief investment strategist at wells capital management, who isn't showing signs of worry. ''politicians are great at telling you they are very important.''   but it's not hard to conjure up ugly events in a trump presidency. his trade policies could damage the economy and lead to job losses, and his fiscal policies could create a far larger deficit, adding trillions to the national debt. stocks and mutual funds held by households have increased in value by over $8 trillion, or 60 percent, over the past five years. if the stock market did make a big move down before the election, it would be felt on main street and your street.   so why is wall street not more worried? and should ordinary investors be worried that wall street is not worried?   it may be a little too early to tell if the stock market is being cavalier about mr. trump. investors don't make big decisions on the basis of a few close polls more than five months before the presidential election. but polls that occurred nearer to election day, and that showed mr. trump well ahead, would more clearly test what investors think of his becoming president. (if you want to know when to worry about the polls, this upshot article has some good pointers.)   another big reason that wall street appears unfazed may be that investors still expect hillary clinton to win. her policies would not be a big departure from those of president obama. a clear sign of mrs. clinton's support on wall street is the large amounts of money that she has been raising from financial executives.   while center-left policies may not please some on wall street, the economy has recovered under president obama. and, if anything, the economy could get stronger, not weaker. house prices are strongly rising, consumers are borrowing without becoming over-indebted, and the banking sector looks safer than it has been in many years.   then there is a belief on wall street that a president trump would end up being no more than a rougher-edged version of mitt romney when it comes to policy. in other words, mr. trump would dial down his combative policies -- like blocking imports from china and mexico -- once those views got him the votes needed to win the presidency. the other way this theory works: congress and the courts prevent him from pursuing goals that could create instability, like the mass deportation of illegal immigrants.   a related school of thought says that limited trade battles would not do much damage to the economy -- and might even help it in the long run. david rosenberg, the chief economist and strategist at gluskin sheff, notes that ronald reagan placed tariffs on some electronics imports from japan, the china of that era. ''if the markets were to sell off because of his election success, i'd tell clients to find another reason to be bearish,'' mr. rosenberg said.   even if mr. trump ended up compromising on many of his antagonistic positions, the residual tension could cause harm. the global economy has been vulnerable to political and economic shocks emanating out of one region (europe) or country (china). the stock market dropped more than 10 percent last year after china devalued its currency by a small amount, for instance.   wall street's apparently laid-back reaction to mr. trump's rise is a twist on the notion that gridlock is good for stocks. much money has been made over the years betting that politicians don't need to be feared because they can't do much -- or won't. but mr. trump could test this consensus view. he didn't adopt confrontational trade policies all of a sudden; he has pushed them for many years. and he has shown little appetite for compromise or bridge-building in his campaign, so why expect it if he were in the white house?   it's too soon for the election to move the stock market by much. but if mr. trump were ahead in the fall, it wouldn't be shocking if the herd suddenly turned.   the upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life. follow us on facebook and twitter. sign up for our newsletter.	1
beijing - donald j. trump has called china a "currency manipulator," threatened to impose stiff tariffs on chinese imports and accused the country of inventing the idea of climate change to hurt american businesses.  but in his first telephone conversation with president xi jinping of china, mr. trump, now the president-elect, appeared to set aside those critiques expressed on the campaign trail, vowing that the two nations would have "one of the strongest relationships," according to a statement released by mr. trump's transition office, reuters reported. mr. xi, in turn, told mr. trump that "facts have shown that cooperation is the only correct choice" for the united states and china, according to xinhua, the chinese state news agency. in the phone call, which took place on monday beijing time, the two men agreed to maintain close communications and to meet at an early date. despite the optimistic tone, analysts believe the relationship between mr. trump and mr. xi could grow tense if mr. trump follows through on his campaign promises, including a vow to impose a 45 percent tax on chinese imports. already, foreign policy experts in china appear to be nervous about the prospect of a trade war. an editorial on sunday in global times, a chinese newspaper known for its nationalistic views, said that trade would be "paralyzed" if mr. trump imposed such a tariff. the article threatened a "tit-for-tat" response, saying that sales of american cars, airplanes, iphones and soybeans would suffer and that china could limit the number of students who go to the united states to study. "making things difficult for china politically will do him no good," the editorial said. "trump, as a shrewd businessman, will not be so naïve." mr. trump is a longtime critic of american trade policies with asian countries, and his pledge to rethink security commitments in japan and south korea has created uncertainty in the region. china, as a rising superpower, sees both benefits and potential dangers in mr. trump's leadership. some analysts believe his focus on domestic issues might allow china to exert more influence in asia and the pacific. others worry that he may abandon international agreements, such as a landmark accord on climate change reached last year. li yonghui, dean of the school of international relations and diplomacy at beijing foreign studies university, said in an interview that mr. trump's emphasis on domestic affairs might help ease tensions between the two countries. but he added that chinese leaders needed to prepare for the possibility that mr. trump might increase pressure on beijing, for example, by imposing more restrictions on trade. "he's very different from the obama administration when it comes to issues like trade and economics," mr. li said.

beijing - throughout his presidential campaign, donald j. trump has claimed that china is stealing american manufacturing jobs. in a speech to the republican national convention on thursday, mr. trump - the party's nominee for the presidency - said that "disastrous trade deals" had hurt manufacturing jobs in the united states. mr. trump also argued that american support for china's embrace of free trade had been a "colossal" mistake. at one point, mr. trump's argument had merit. with its large pool of workers who earned much lower wages than their american counterparts, china attracted manufacturers seeking to reduce costs, bolster profitability and keep prices low. between 1999 and 2011, the united states lost at least two million jobs because of a surge in chinese imports, according to a study published in the journal of labor economics. in today's china, however, workers face a more troubled outlook than mr. trump suggests. they are losing their jobs because of a slowing domestic economy, rising costs and stiffer foreign competition - including from the united states.  presidential candidates "are screaming about yesterday's problems," said jim mcgregor, chairman of the consulting firm apco worldwide's greater china operations. "manufacturing for export is getting harder and harder" in china. as its economy has expanded, creating opportunities in many sectors, assembly line jobs are not as attractive as they once were. that has caused managers to raise wages to attract workers. at the same time, local governments in shenzhen, a coastal trading hub that abuts hong kong, and other industrial centers have steadily increased the mandated minimum wage to improve the welfare of working families and pressure companies to produce more expensive, high-value products. that combination has pushed wages for chinese factory workers higher. their monthly pay now averages $424, 29 percent more than just three years ago, the japan external trade organization has estimated. labor costs in china are now significantly higher than in many other emerging economies. factory workers in vietnam earn less than half the salary of a chinese worker, while those in bangladesh get paid under a quarter as much. rising costs have also significantly altered china's competitive position compared with the united states. in a 2015 study, the boston consulting group said the costs of manufacturing in china's major export-producing zone were now almost the same as in the united states, after taking into account wages, worker productivity, energy costs and other factors. without the lure of large cost savings, more american companies are "reshoring," or moving factories back. in a separate survey of large united states manufacturers conducted by bcg last year, 24 percent said that they were actively shifting production home from china or were planning to do so over the next two years, up from only 10 percent in 2012. "it just makes economic sense," said hal sirkin, a senior partner at bcg. "the u.s. right now is in a very favorable position." that means more jobs for american factory workers. half of the respondents in the bcg survey said they expected the number of manufacturing workers they employed in the united states to increase over the next five years. and it is not just the united states that is taking jobs away from china. rising costs are driving many companies in a variety of sectors to relocate business to a wide range of other countries. in the most recent survey from the american chamber of commerce in china, a quarter of respondents said they had either already moved or were planning to move operations out of china, citing rising costs as the top reason. of those, almost half are moving into other developing countries in asia, while nearly 40 percent are shifting to the united states, canada and mexico. many of the factories moving away make the products often found on the shelves of american retailers. stella international, a footwear manufacturer headquartered in hong kong that makes shoes for michael kors, rockport and other major brands, closed one of its factories in china in february and shifted some of that production to plants in vietnam and indonesia. tal, another hong kong-based manufacturer that makes clothing for american brands including dockers and brooks brothers, plans to close one of its chinese factories this year and move that work to new facilities in vietnam and ethiopia. other companies with an extensive presence in china may not be closing factories, but are targeting new investments elsewhere. taiwan's foxconn, best known for making apple iphones in chinese factories, is planning to build as many as 12 new assembly plants in india, creating around one million new jobs there. a pilot operation in the western indian state of maharashtra will start churning out mobile phones later this year. and though china remains by far the largest exporter of clothing to the united states, it is facing more competition from lower-cost rivals in asia. last year, china's market share of apparel exports to america declined, while countries such as vietnam and bangladesh gained, according to a march report from the fung business intelligence centre, a hong kong-based research outfit that specializes in supply chain and sourcing issues. "it's not like china is an attractive location for all low-cost jobs," said james zimmerman, the american chamber's chairman in beijing. "china is moving up the value chain, which will mean an adjustment." the rate of growth has dropped to its slowest pace in a quarter-century, hurting many industries. manufacturing - which accounts for about a fifth of all urban employment in china - has been hit especially hard. officially, china's job market is weathering the downturn surprisingly well, with government data showing unemployment of only 4 percent. some economists, however, believe the employment situation is not as rosy as official statistics suggest. a june report from fathom consulting, based in london, estimates that unemployment and underemployment in china will reach 12.9 percent this year - triple the level in 2012. leland miller, the chief executive of china beige book international, a research firm, says the job market hit a critical inflection point late last year, as the weakening economy finally started to bite. his figures show hiring began to plunge in the fourth quarter of 2015, and though the situation stabilized in recent months, probably because of greater government stimulus, mr. miller believes the improvement is not sustainable. many industrial companies are burdened by excess capacity, and downsizing may be unavoidable. in february, china's minister for human resources and social security estimated that 1.8 million workers could lose their jobs in the steel and coal sectors alone. "if anyone is claiming that china is still enjoying a healthy or robust jobs market," mr. miller said, "they have no idea what they're talking about." photo: a pegatron plant in shanghai, where iphones are made. some assembly-line jobs are moving to cheaper countries.

beijing -- china's leaders have been markedly reticent about what kind of leader they think donald j. trump will be. a pragmatic dealmaker, as his business background might indicate? or a provocateur who tests the ways of statecraft? by talking on friday with taiwan's president, tsai ing-wen, mr. trump answered that question in stark terms, chinese analysts said saturday. breaking decades of american diplomatic practice, he caught the chinese government off guard by lunging into the most sensitive of its so-called core interests, the ''one china'' policy agreed to by president richard m. nixon more than four decades ago.    ''this is a wake-up call for beijing -- we should buckle up for a pretty rocky six months or year in the china-u.s. relationship,'' wang dong, an associate professor at the school of international studies at peking university, said saturday. ''there was a sort of delusion based on overly optimistic ideas about trump. that should stop.''    chinese leaders covet stability in their relationship with washington, and perhaps for that reason, they have allowed fairly rosy assessments of mr. trump to appear in the state-run news media. many of those accounts have depicted the president-elect as a practical operator devoid of ideology, the kind of person china might find common ground with despite his threats of a trade war.   in the hope of maintaining a relatively smooth relationship as mr. trump begins his administration, beijing will probably take a wait-and-see attitude despite his phone call with ms. tsai, said shi yinhong, a professor of international relations at renmin university.   indeed, china's first official reaction, from foreign minister wang yi, was fairly benign -- though it was firm in reiterating the one china policy, under which the united states formally recognized beijing as china's sole government in 1978 and broke ties with taiwan a year later. no american president or president-elect had spoken to a taiwanese president since then.   mr. wang blamed ms. tsai's government for arranging the call. ''it won't stand a chance to change the one china policy agreed upon by the international community,'' he said.   a follow-up statement from the ministry of foreign affairs on saturday, noting that the ministry had filed a formal complaint with the united states government, was similar in tone. it urged ''relevant parties in the u.s.'' to ''deal with the taiwan issue in a prudent, proper manner.''  china's leaders disdain ms. tsai, of taiwan's democratic progressive party, who was elected president this year after pledging to wean the island off its economic dependence on china, a policy that won enthusiastic support from younger taiwanese.  china favored her original opponent, hung hsiu-chu of the kuomintang, which has sought closer ties with mainland china. (ms. hung later dropped out of the race.) before the election, president xi jinping of china met with ms. tsai's predecessor, ma ying-jeou, also of the kuomintang, in the first encounter between the leaders of the two governments, a rapprochement that beijing had long sought.   mr. trump broke a chinese taboo merely by using ms. tsai's title. the chinese state news media refer to the taiwanese president as the ''leader of the taiwan region,'' to indicate that beijing regards taiwan not as a sovereign nation but as chinese territory to eventually be brought under its control.   a basic tenet of the chinese government is that taiwan, where chiang kai-shek's forces fled in 1949 after losing china's civil war, will be brought back into the fold. according to mr. xi, taiwan is destined to become an integral part of his so-called china dream, a vision of an economically successful communist china astride the world.   mr. trump's phone call also violated a longstanding principle of american policy: that the president does not speak to the head of taiwan's government, despite selling arms to it. ''interesting how the us sells taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but i should not accept a congratulatory call,'' mr. trump said on twitter after the stunned reaction to his conversation with ms. tsai.   though beijing vehemently protests the arms sales, it also warily acknowledges them as part of long-established practice. since the mid-1990s, washington has signaled to taiwan that it will not support any military effort to gain independence from china.   the obama administration's last arms sale to taiwan, in 2015, was relatively modest -- consisting of antitank missiles, two frigates and surveillance gear, worth $1.8 billion in total -- but it still provoked a bitter denunciation from beijing.   douglas h. paal, a former director of the american institute in taiwan, which represents american interests there, said it would not be surprising if the united states sold arms to taiwan early in the trump administration. beijing's reaction would depend on the price tag, the kinds of weapons sold and how the administration informed china of the sale, mr. paal said.   while it broke diplomatic precedent, mr. trump's conversation with ms. tsai could be seen in some ways as following a pattern of republican presidents' reaching out to taiwan, although others did not do so before taking office.   george w. bush, for example, was vocal in his support of taiwan early in his presidency, saying in a television interview that the united states would do ''whatever it took'' to defend it. his aides said afterward that the comment did not reflect a change in the one china policy. by the end of his second term, mr. bush had helped to strengthen trade ties between beijing and washington through the approval of china's entry into the world trade organization.   though mr. trump has received generally favorable coverage in the state news media, some chinese analysts have expressed irritation with him, and some have suggested that his administration will offer china opportunities to show strength.   yan xuetong, a professor of international relations at tsinghua university and a foreign policy hawk, said the overall tenor of the china-united states relationship in the coming years would depend a great deal on the personal chemistry between mr. trump and mr. xi. he said china, with its growing military and the second-largest economy in the world, could largely afford to act as it liked. ''china is increasingly resilient to the united states,'' he said.   shen dingli, a professor of international relations at fudan university in shanghai, took a contrarian view of mr. trump's call with ms. tsai: he said it was not a problem because mr. trump had yet to take office. ''he is a private citizen,'' he said.   but if such contacts continue after inauguration day, mr. shen said, china should end diplomatic relations with the united states.   ''i would close our embassy in washington and withdraw our diplomats,'' he said. ''i would be perfectly happy to end the relationship. i don't know how you are then going to expect china to cooperate on iran and north korea and climate change. you are going to ask taiwan for that?''	2
 s.e.c. said to be investigating tesla the securities and exchange commission is investigating whether tesla motors breached securities laws by failing to disclose to investors a fatal crash involving an electric car that was driving itself, the wall street journal reports, citing a person familiar with the matter. the crash killed the driver, joshua brown, who collided with an 18-wheeler that pulled in front of him on a florida highway in may. tesla alerted the national highway traffic safety administration to the accident and investigated to determine whether the car was using its autopilot system, but did not disclose the crash to investors in a securities filing. the national transportation safety is also investigating whether systemic issues are tied to driverless cars, an agency spokesman said on monday. the s.e.c. is examining whether tesla should have disclosed the accident as a "material" event, or a development a reasonable investor would consider important, a person familiar with the matter said. a tesla spokeswoman asserted that the crash did not require disclosure to investors.   "tesla has not received any communication from the s.e.c. regarding this issue," she said. "our blog post last week provided the relevant information about this issue." the crash happened on may 7 and tesla learned of it soon afterward. it informed auto safety regulators on may 16. in its security filing for its $2 billion stock sale two days later, the company did not disclose the accident. xerox said to be in talks to buy r.r. donnelley xerox is in talks to buy r.r. donnelley & sons, the owner of the edgar financial statement wire service, bloomberg reports, citing people with knowledge of the matter. xerox plans to separate into two companies by the end of the year and would merge some of r.r. donnelley with its copier and printer business. the rest would be merged with its smaller business outsourcing services, people with knowledge of the matter told bloomberg. a deal could be announced before xerox's split is completed. r.r. donnelley had also announced plans to split into three publicly traded companies, but a deal with xerox would negate that plan.  xerox and r.r. donnelley reportedly saw the opportunity of a merger after the deal between hewlett packard enterprise and computer sciences bolstered both companies' share prices. xerox has a market value of about $9.6 billion, while r.r. donnelley is worth about $3.9 billion. on the agenda daniel k. tarullo, of the federal reserve board of governors, will speak at the center for american progress in washington about shadow banking and how the nation can avoid the next crisis at 9 a.m. the house financial services committee will hold a hearing on the financial choice act at 10 a.m. and a hearing on online marketplace lending at 2 p.m. the president of the minneapolis fed, neel kashkari, will hold a town hall at northern michigan university at 5 p.m. regulator warning over banks' property lending thomas curry, comptroller of the currency, used a biannual financial risk report to issue a warning over looser underwriting standards and concentrations in banks' commercial real estate portfolios, the financial times reports.  mr. curry suggested that these loans were of greater concern than car loans and lending to already indebted companies.  "while leveraged lending and auto lending remain concerns, cre lending and concentration risk management has become an area of emphasis for regulators," he said in a speech, referring to commercial real estate lending. "our exams found looser underwriting standards with less-restrictive covenants, extended maturities, longer interest-only periods, limited guarantor requirements, and deficient-stress testing practices."  his remarks come after the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corporation said they would pay special attention to banks' commercial property lending. in spite of these concerns, banks have been expanding in this area. commercial real estate loans originated by banks in the first quarter jumped 44 percent from the same period in 2015 and banks' share of these loans has risen from over a third in 2014 to more than half in the first quarter of 2016. contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com  unicredit and santander scramble to save asset manager merger unicredit of italy and banco santander of spain are scrambling to save a plan to create one of europe's largest money managers after britain's vote to leave the european union complicated the outlook for the deal, which is worth 5.3 billion euros, or about $5.9 billion.the financial times deutsche börse lowers threshold for london stock exchange merger at least 60 percent of deutsche börse's outstanding shares must be tendered for the deal to be successful, down from 75 percent.nyt »  valuation quirks help end proposed polycom-mitel merger investors were unimpressed after both companies lost money while under threat from larger rivals like cisco, jeffrey goldfarb writes in breakingviews.nyt »  online security company said to work with qatalyst to explore sale imperva, an online security company that has been targeted by elliott management, hired qatalyst partners to explore a sale after receiving unsolicited takeover interest, bloomberg reports, citing people with knowledge of the matter.bloomberg  thyssenkrupp confirms talks with tata steel over possible merger the german conglomerate thyssenkrupp confirmed that it is in talks with tata steel of india and other steel groups over a potential tie-up, giving the strongest indication yet that the german company would help drive a new wave of expected consolidation in the beleaguered european steel sector.the wall street journal chinese developer in talks with blackstone on property purchase china vanke said it was working with other partners on a $1.9 billion acquisition of commercial property in china from the american group.nyt »  jamie dimon of jpmorgan: why we're giving our employees a raise wages for many americans have gone nowhere for too long. so i'm announcing an increase for 18,000 of my workers.nyt »  goldman sachs informs regulator of 55 more job cuts in new york about half are traders and salesmen in the securities division, with the rest scattered across other units, bloomberg reports, citing a person briefed on the matter.bloomberg  citi bolsters equities team to exploit uncertainty about 'brexit' citigroup is increasing its european strategic equities team to meet higher client demand for solutions to deal with the financial fallout of the britain's decision to leave the european union.the financial times  investors scan the murky waters of britain's future as britain's chancellor proclaims a commitment to global free trade, many are skeptical of prospects while alienated from european trading partners.nyt »  osborne said to intervene in hsbc money laundering investigation the british chancellor, george osborne, sought to help hsbc avoid criminal charges in the united states for money laundering by warning that a heavy-handed approach from the authorities could plunge the global financial system into turmoil, according to a house committee report prepared by the republicans.the financial times  pokémon go brings augmented reality to a mass audience pokémon go is the work of a start-up, niantic, which was created inside google and spun out of the company last year.nyt » | pokémon players take their hunt to the streets of new york  lyft says it is likely to expand overseas john zimmer, the president and co-founder of lyft, the second-largest ride-hailing company in the united states, said that the company would "very likely" expand to other countries.bloomberg  can we ignore the alarm bells the bond market is ringing?

beijing - china signaled on thursday that it had installed weapons on disputed south china sea islands and would use them like a "slingshot" to repel threats, compounding tensions with the incoming trump administration. the chinese message, in a defense ministry statement, suggested that china was further watering down a pledge made by its president, xi jinping, to not militarize the islands. the comments left little doubt that such installations were part of china's plan to deepen its territorial claim over the islands, which has raised tensions with its neighbors over their rival claims and with washington over freedom of navigation in the south china sea, one of the world's busiest commercial waterways. they were also likely to further complicate china's already testy relations with president-elect donald j. trump. china's rapid creation of artificial islands in the south china sea, expanding former reefs and outcrops into guarded permanent outposts, has already become a major source of tension with washington.  repeatedly this year, the chinese have accused the united states of making "provocative" moves by sending warships near some of these islands, known as the spratlys. the chinese have been creating harbors, runways and reinforced hangars big enough for military aircraft on the islands. but new satellite images made public this week appeared to reveal weapons emplacements for the first time. the center for strategic and international studies in washington, which released the images through its asia maritime transparency initiative, said they showed "large antiaircraft guns and probable close-in weapons systems," which can theoretically thwart cruise missile attacks. the defense ministry statement, posted on its website in response to the images, did not specify what kinds of weapons the images showed but said any military hardware on the islands was reasonable. it repeated china's contention that its construction on the islands is mainly for civilian purposes. "as for necessary military facilities, they are primarily for defense and self-protection, and this is proper and legitimate," the defense ministry said. "for instance, if someone was at the door of your home, cocky and swaggering, how could it be that you wouldn't prepare a slingshot?" mr. trump recently angered chinese officials by holding a phone conversation with tsai ing-wen, the president of taiwan, an island that beijing deems a breakaway province of china. it had been nearly four decades since a united states president or president-elect had such direct contact with a taiwanese leader. in an interview broadcast on sunday, mr. trump also criticized china over its trade imbalance with america, its military activities in the south china sea and its ties to north korea. china was "building a massive fortress in the middle of the south china sea, which they shouldn't be doing," he said in the interview on fox news. during his campaign, mr. trump dwelled on accusations that china had systematically sapped american industrial might, and he has indicated that trade issues will be a priority in dealings with beijing. but the latest disclosures suggest how seemingly remote islands in the south china sea could become a source of serious tensions, even military strife. the spratlys, which china calls the nansha islands, are the subject of an especially volatile mix of competing claims. parts of the archipelago are also claimed by the philippines, malaysia, vietnam, brunei and taiwan. and the possibility of undersea oil and gas deposits has exacerbated the rivalries. president rodrigo duterte of the philippines has moved in recent months to ease tensions with china, and to distance his country from washington. even so, the philippines keeps defense treaties with the united states. but china, with the world's second-biggest economy and a swelling military budget, has established an intimidating dominance across much of the south china sea. and the latest satellite images appeared to confirm its deepening military grip on the spratlys. the steps "show that beijing is serious about defense of its artificial islands in case of an armed contingency in the south china sea," the asia maritime defense initiative said in its report about the images. "among other things, they would be the last line of defense against cruise missiles launched by the united states or others" against air bases that may soon go into operation on the islands, it said. the obama administration sought to play down both the images and the chinese defense ministry's response. "we watch chinese naval developments very carefully, and we urge all parties in the south china sea to avoid actions that raise tensions," said capt. jeff davis, a pentagon spokesman. the images elicited a far more contentious response from hawkish republicans, who do not necessarily share mr. trump's views on china trade policy but see beijing's actions in the south china sea as an aggressive challenge to the united states. senator john mccain, chairman of the senate armed services committee, said the images confirmed "what has long been evident: china is militarizing the south china sea, its leaders continue to lie about that fact, and beijing is paying little to no price for its behavior." some american military officials suggested privately that the antiaircraft emplacements were purely defensive in nature, with a limited range, useful only if the outposts were under attack. of greater concern, they said, was the possibility that china could one day install more advanced antiaircraft missile systems on the islands, which can fire at targets hundreds of miles away. adm. harry b. harris jr., head of the united states pacific command, said on wednesday that america would not abandon its military presence across the asia-pacific region. he indicated that american naval ships would continue passing through the south china sea to show that the united states "will not allow the shared domains to be closed down unilaterally, no matter how many bases are built on artificial features in the south china sea." the chinese government has said it respects freedom of civilian passage in the south china sea but also called american naval "freedom of navigation operations" dangerous meddling. the chinese navy has not tried to block the operations. the latest images raised new doubts about the intent of comments made by china's president, mr. xi, after he met president obama in the white house in september last year. with mr. obama at his side, mr. xi told reporters that "china does not intend to pursue militarization" of the islands. previous satellite pictures of the islands, released by the asia maritime defense initiative in august, already indicated that china was building military facilities there. those images appeared to show reinforced aircraft hangars at the fiery cross, subi and mischief reefs, all part of the disputed parts of the archipelago. a spokesman for china's ministry of foreign affairs said thursday that his government had been entitled to take such steps and said they did not count as "militarization." the spokesman, geng shuang, said he could not confirm the precise findings from the latest satellite images but disputed they indicated any change on china's part. "if china constructing normal facilities on its own islands and deploying necessary territorial defense facilities counts as 'militarization,'" he said, "then what about sending fleets through the south china sea?" follow chris buckley on twitter @chubailiang.helene cooper contributed reporting from washington, and rick gladstone from new york. maps: fiery cross reef: november 10, 2016 (source: csis asia maritime transparency initiative/digitalglobe) (a3)related articles	2
president-elect donald j. trump has questioned the return that the united states gets for defending its allies. here's thecurrent picture of what america puts in and gets out of global alliances.    the european union is america's top trading partner. keeping europe peaceful and unified has been a top u.s. priority since world war ii.   the united states keeps a large footprint in asia to counter the influence of china and to support allies against north korea.   south korea covers 40 percent of the united states' basing costs there, worth $843 million annually   thirty percent of global maritime trade runs through the south china sea. the u.s. is competing with china to lead in that fast-growing market   protect south china sea trade worth $5.3 trillion, about 30 percent of global maritime trade. includes $1.2 trillion in trade with the united states   in the middle east, the united states wants to maintain access to oil and gas, and partners against terrorism and iran.	4
davos, switzerland -- for the investors and market-movers at the annual world economic forum here, a threat lurks. at cocktail parties where the champagne flows, financiers have expressed bewilderment over the rise of populist groups that are feeding a backlash against globalization. in the halls of the davos congress center, where many of the meetings this week are taking place, investors have tried to make sense of the political upheaval.    the world order has been upended. as the united states retreats from the promise of free trade, china is taking up the mantle. the stark shift leaves investors trying to assess the new risk and opportunities in the global economy.   ''this is the first time there is absolutely no consensus,'' said william f. browder, a co-founder of hermitage capital management who has been coming to davos for 21 years. ''everyone is looking into the abyss.''    the religion of the global elite -- free trade and open markets -- is under attack, and there has been a lot of hand-wringing over what christine lagarde of the international monetary fund has declared a ''middle-class crisis.''   but while all attendees in davos have a view on the state of the world, there is little agreement on how to deal with it.   the biggest concern? finding a way to make the people who are driving populist movements feel like they are part of the global economic pie that davos participants have created and largely own.   in a twitter post from the swiss resort, ian bremmer, the president of eurasia group, a political-research firm, offered his advice: ''elites won't be able to manage populism until they stop seeing it as a threat and start seeing it as a symptom.''   ''i want to be loud and clear: populism scares me,'' ray dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, said during a panel on how to fix the middle-class crisis. ''the no. 1 issue economically as a market participant is how populism manifests itself over the next year or two.'' but mr. dalio offered little by way of a solution, beyond opining on the positive aspects of loosening regulation and lowering taxes.   on the subject of rising populism, mr. dalio, who runs the $150 billion investment firm bridgewater associates, added: ''it's an anti-davos way of operating.''   jack ma, the founder of alibaba in china, offered his view of the problem in the united states. americans, he said, ''do not distribute the money properly.''   if there was one thing that davos attendees agreed on last year, it was that donald j. trump would not win the united states presidential election.   and so this year, with mr. trump's inauguration on friday coinciding with the end of the world economic forum, every conversation has drifted to one question: what will the trump presidency look like, and what will it mean for business?   to many american financiers who once opposed mr. trump's candidacy, the prospect of fewer regulations and a blank slate with a new leader has assuaged some of the fear about uncertainties. at the forum, some attendees have been thrust into a role of interpreting the president-elect to a befuddled global elite.   ''he's not necessarily communicating in a way that the people in this community would love,'' said anthony scaramucci, a hedge fund regular at davos and onetime critic of mr. trump who is now set to join the administration as a public liaison and adviser. ''but he is communicating very, very effectively to a very large group of the population in europe and the u.s. that are feeling a common struggle right now.''   mr. scaramucci promised that mr. trump had ''the utmost respect for angela merkel,'' the german chancellor who was the subject of an attack by the president-elect this week; that he was in fact a champion of free trade; and that he wanted to have a ''phenomenal relationship with the chinese,'' despite his fiery anti-china language.   soon after his appearance on a panel, mr. scaramucci was on a plane heading to washington to attend mr. trump's inauguration. but his words still resonated, mainly because they were being broadcast on a giant screen behind a coffee bar where world economic forum participants congregated between meetings.   one davos regular, the billionaire investor paul singer, did not attend this year. mr. singer, a vociferous critic of mr. trump for most of the election campaign, was instead making his way to washington for the inauguration, having recently donated $1 million to the event.   george soros, the investor and philanthropist who has called mr. trump ''a con man,'' hosted a dinner on thursday evening in davos, during which he said that mr. trump ''would be a dictator if he could get away with it.'' this was unlikely to happen, he added, because of strong democratic institutions in the united states.   for those who have been puzzled over market euphoria since mr. trump's election, mr. soros put it this way: ''markets see trump dismantling regulations and reducing taxes -- and that has been their dream.''   but mr. soros, who became known as the man who broke the bank of england with a bet against the british pound in 1992, added that he was convinced that mr. trump would fail. ''i don't think the markets are going to do very well,'' he said.   when president xi jinping addressed the davos forum, becoming the first chinese head of state to do so, his message was clear: china is ready for the world stage. he championed free trade and open markets, setting the tone for the week.   among the delegation that arrived in davos with mr. xi were some of china's biggest business leaders including mr. ma, wang jianlin of dalian wanda, and top executives from baidu, huawei technologies and china telecom. through the week, they have been meeting with investors and talking deals with erstwhile partners.   ''i wasn't sure if it was president xi or ronald reagan,'' joked thomas w. farley, president of the new york stock exchange. at a lunch with mr. ma of alibaba, mr. xi was quoting abraham lincoln, mr. ma told a small group of participants on wednesday.   it was a message somewhat at odds with the roots of china's ruling communist party. and back in washington, wilbur ross, mr. trump's nominee for commerce secretary, did not mince words, calling china ''the most protectionist'' major economy, setting the stage for a possible trade war.   alicia bárcena ibarra, who heads the united nations economic commission for latin america and the caribbean, told a small group that china could soon overtake the united states when it comes to importance in latin america.   she described how on the same day last year that mr. trump told the world he would not sign the trans-pacific partnership, mr. xi arrived for a summit meeting in chile.   ''so can you imagine the impact when he came talking about free trade as he did this morning?'' she said, referring to mr. xi's address on tuesday in davos. ''china now is the second-most important trade partner of latin america after the u.s.''	1
as election day approaches in the united states, the chinese are paying closer attention to the selection of the next president. government censorship, the language barrier and an unfamiliarity with american political conventions have left many chinese confused about the process. many seem to have derived their sense of how the system works from ''house of cards,'' the netflix series about an unscrupulous politician who stops at nothing, not even murder, to scheme his way to power. the show was enormously popular in china.    last year, you tianlong, a chinese doctoral student in justice studies at arizona state university, co-founded a podcast called ''xuanmei,'' or ''u.s. election,'' aimed at younger, urban chinese. mr. you and his partners -- hua jianping, who writes on american politics, and zhuang qiaoyi, who holds a master's degree in international relations from syracuse university -- and their guests discuss topics that have ranged from voter registration to how campaign managers tap into data to advance candidates' prospects.    an estimated 70,000 people listen the podcasts every month. in august, mr. you published ''get elected: a very short introduction to the u.s. presidential election'' (taihai publishing house, beijing) with mr. hua and lin yao, who has a ph.d. in political science from columbia university.   in an interview, mr. you explained that the chinese are more interested in the united states presidential election than ever, but don't always understand it.   i feel that the biggest misunderstanding is that many chinese take ''house of cards'' too seriously. american politics is complicated, even for americans. for many chinese, it's just too confusing. so people take a shortcut. ''house of cards'' is so real for them that it filters their impressions of american politics.   another misunderstanding is derived from the negative propaganda many chinese have absorbed over the years, that is, that american politics is controlled by money or big capitalists and that politicians are just puppets controlled by capitalists. it's possible that there are serious problems in american politics. but as far as plutocratic politics is concerned, it's not as bad as people in china imagine.   on the other hand, some liberal intellectuals in china believe that the united states is good in every way. its political system is good and its people's voices are heard. they attribute every achievement of the united states to its superior political system.   i feel that many chinese aren't really observing american politics as much as they're projecting their own biases onto american politics.   are people in china are better informed about the presidential election than four or eight years ago?   we have access to far more information than we did four or eight years ago. millions of chinese have traveled to the united states. we have a powerful internet and social media. a large percentage of younger people speak english. but american politics is complicated. to understand it, we need to put it into context, which many chinese can't do.   obviously chinese political views vary. but i've noticed that many in our audience who express their views publicly take a nationalistic stance. they look at the election from the perspective of what's best for china.   data from google analytics show that about 60 percent are under 35, so born after china embarked on economic reform and opening. most -- 72 percent -- are in china and about 15 percent are living in the united states.   the four most popular shows, according to google analytics, dealt with obama's health care reform, guests explaining why they are against donald trump, spending bills and the iowa caucuses. it shouldn't be surprising that chinese are interested in obamacare. china is also undergoing health care reform and we want to learn lessons from the united states.   as your chinese listeners learn more about presidential politics and the american political system during this election, do they get more or less cynical?   it's hard to tell. from the comments of some trump supporters on our zhihu account [a question-and-answer website], they are clearly angry. but i can't tell how representative they are of our audience. my personal observation is that they might be overpowering other voices by expressing themselves loudly and attacking others.   but i would like to say that 2016 appears to be the beginning of a real chinese interest in u.s. elections. the combination of a growing middle-class, more overseas experience and easier access to information have fostered more interest than i've seen before.   you say many people in china seem to like trump. but what about his attacks on china and threats of high tariffs over trade issues and his hard line on immigration and insensitivities toward ethnic minorities? are these chinese really supportive or just entertained?   first of all, many chinese don't like hillary clinton. since the 1995 united nations' world conference on women in beijing, hillary has been difficult towards china. when she became a senator, she often interfered in united states-china relations. when she became secretary of state, she advocated the pivot to asia, which is seen by the chinese government and public as an attempt to contain china. of course chinese people dislike her.   second, many chinese don't like the democratic party. president truman, a democrat, supported chiang kai-shek, oversaw the korean war and interfered in china-taiwan relations. president kennedy, a democrat, got involved in vietnam. president clinton, a democrat, criticized china's human rights record and slowed negotiations on china entering the world trade organization. meanwhile, president eisenhower, a republican, ended the korean war and president nixon, a republican, ended the vietnam war and initiated the normalization of chinese-u.s. relations. many chinese think another democratic president would not be favorable to china.   third, many chinese support trump's isolationist foreign policy. they believe that trump would take a more pragmatic approach towards china and create new opportunities for china's rise.   this article was adapted from a feature that first appeared on the chinese-language site of the new york times.   get news and analysis from asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the today's headlines: asian morning newsletter. sign up here.	1
the stock market has continued to reach new highs, troubled only fleetingly by rising interest rates, sluggish corporate earnings and new and uncomfortable political realities. monetary policy is tightening, government spending is expected to expand substantially, and, as the american presidential election and the vote in britain to leave the european union show, trade relations and other ties among nations may be fraying. how those trends progress should go a long way to determining the performance of stocks and bonds as the year moves along.    these aren't the only issues for investors to contend with, either. economic indicators have perked up -- unemployment in december, reported on jan. 6, was 4.7 percent, and consumer confidence is near multiyear highs -- but the earnings outlook remains subdued, stock valuations remain high and bond yields are low but rising. under these circumstances, many investment advisers recommend taking only minimal, reasonably priced risks.   ''i'm hard pressed to locate any investment where you can make a strong argument that it's undervalued,'' said joe davis, global chief economist at vanguard and head of the firm's investment strategy group. ''just as the economic environment seems to be improving, the investment environment is more challenging. investors have more risk in their portfolios than at any time since 1999.''    ben inker, co-head of asset allocation at the gmo investment firm, likewise finds ''plenty of things to worry about.''   the standard & poor's 500-stock index early this month traded at about 26 times the earnings that the constituent companies reported in the previous year, higher than at almost any time in history. one reason that investors are willing to pay so much is that they see even less value in other assets.   ''the rest of the world looks scarier than the u.s.,'' mr. inker said. ''who would want to touch europe? who would want to touch emerging'' markets? as scary as they may appear, he recommends investing in emerging stock markets as the best of a series of difficult choices. ''it's not that we have high hopes for the emerging world this year,'' he said, ''but they're priced for a really bad outcome. the u.s. is priced for a really good outcome.''   american stocks had a really good outcome in 2016. the s.&p. 500 rose 9.5 percent, to 2,238.83, including a 3.3 percent gain in the fourth quarter.   the average domestic stock fund in morningstar's database rose 3.3 percent in the quarter and 10.9 percent on the year. leading the way in the quarter, with double-digit gains, were portfolios that focused on financial services, smaller companies, energy and industrials.   whether managers make the most of it, david kelly, chief global strategist at j. p. morgan asset management, finds solid prospects in american stocks this year, more than many of his peers do.   he favors sectors most sensitive to rising growth, such as financial services, technology and consumer discretionary stocks.   ''the general trend of government policy will be pretty pro-business and much more friendly to the u.s. corporate sector than it has been,'' he said. but he said that ''the republicans may get sidetracked by antitrade rhetoric.''   president-elect donald j. trump has proposed raising tariffs on imported goods, and some republicans in congress have proposed changing corporate tax rules to reward exporters and punish importers. economists generally agree that higher tariffs reduce competitiveness and drive up prices of imported goods, including parts supplied to american manufacturers.   mr. kelly is also wary of mr. trump's pledges to increase government spending on infrastructure projects.   ''there isn't actually any money in the budget to fulfill his agenda,'' he said. ''congress may decide not to worry about it and push up the debt, and we'll end up with more debt and inflation.''   and we may have higher interest rates, too. the federal reserve raised rates in december, only the second time in a decade. mr. kelly expects three, possibly four, increases this year.   the more forbidding rate environment may account for much of the run-up in bond yields last year. yields on 10-year treasury issues rose to 2.44 percent at the end of december from 1.36 percent in early july, with most of the increase occurring just after election day, according to bloomberg.   bond funds lost 1 percent in the fourth quarter, depressed by the 11.8 percent plunge in portfolios that specialize in long-term government issues. for the full year, according to morningstar, the average bond fund was up 5.9 percent, helped by double-digit gains in riskier categories like high-yield and emerging market debt.   laird landmann, co-director of fixed income at the tcw fund-management company, said he saw little to recommend to investors because ''asset prices are getting out of whack with the economy.''   his advice is to play it safe and stick with treasury bonds, certain mortgage-backed securities not issued or guaranteed by the federal government, and bonds issued by american banks.   ''it's hard to buy things after eight years of a credit cycle,'' mr. landmann said. ''wait for it to turn; that's the discipline of being a value investor.''   when considering any benefits of spending measures introduced by mr. trump and congress, it's important to remember that they wouldn't be spread far and wide. hope that the global recovery might at last get some legs helped emerging stock markets last year, but they gave back about seven months' worth of gains in the week after the election, as investors weighed the prospect of mr. trump's protectionist campaign language being translated into action.   the average emerging market stock fund lost 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter but still gained 9 percent for the year. international stock funds over all fell 2.8 percent in the quarter and rose 4.9 percent on the year.   some of the worst-performing stock markets were in countries on which mr. trump has focused. mexico lost 8 percent in 2016, and the shanghai composite index in china was down more than 12 percent, although funds concentrating on china and its surroundings rose 0.7 percent.   the president-elect's outlook ''is clearly antiglobalization,'' said rick schmidt, co-manager of the harding loevner emerging markets fund.   ''trade is going to have a bigger impact on some markets than others,'' he said. ''in emerging markets, clearly there are places where risk hasn't retreated. mexico is no. 1, china is no. 2.''   ''whether he can implement'' his agenda ''is one thing, but you have to assume he means it,'' mr. schmidt added. ''it would be dangerous not to take him at his word.''   just as mr. inker prefers emerging markets because the risk they entail comes at the right price, mr. schmidt sees some of the best opportunities this year in beaten-down markets like mexico.   elsewhere, he finds india overpriced, and he is avoiding utilities and chinese banks, although he likes banks in other countries.   mr. kelly also sees emerging markets as cheap and therefore good long-term plays, and he likes european stocks over the long haul, too.   while emerging markets are appealing to many based on their valuations, mr. landmann warned that they may be particularly vulnerable to potential missteps in a trump presidency.   ''markets are not going to crash necessarily, but you could see crashes in more fragile areas like china,'' he said.   mr. davis, at vanguard, advised investors to make sure they are globally diversified and not overly dependent on american markets. he also encouraged them to expect less. ''one risk for equity markets for 2017 is they are pricing in 4 percent economic growth,'' he said. ''i think that's unlikely; they seem to be discounting risks to free trade.''   the economy has been growing at barely half that rate. ''i'm not bearish on the economy,'' mr. davis said, ''but i think expectations on returns need to be lowered.''   ''i would have thought that the prospect of surprising statements coming out of the white house in the form of tweets would generate uncertainty, and markets don't like uncertainty,'' he said. ''so far the u.s. market has not seemed to mind. we'll have to see. this is uncharted territory.''	9
beijing -- donald j. trump has called china a ''currency manipulator,'' threatened to impose stiff tariffs on chinese imports and accused the country of inventing the idea of climate change to hurt american businesses.  but in his first telephone conversation with president xi jinping of china, mr. trump, now the president-elect, appeared to set aside those critiques expressed on the campaign trail, vowing that the two nations would have ''one of the strongest relationships,'' according to a statement released by mr. trump's transition office, reuters reported.    mr. xi, in turn, told mr. trump that ''facts have shown that cooperation is the only correct choice'' for the united states and china, according to xinhua, the chinese state news agency.   in the phone call, which took place on monday beijing time, the two men agreed to maintain close communications and to meet at an early date.   despite the optimistic tone, analysts believe the relationship between mr. trump and mr. xi could grow tense if mr. trump follows through on his campaign promises, including a vow to impose a 45 percent tax on chinese imports. already, foreign policy experts in china appear to be nervous about the prospect of a trade war.   an editorial on sunday in global times, a chinese newspaper known for its nationalistic views, said that trade would be ''paralyzed'' if mr. trump imposed such a tariff. the article threatened a ''tit-for-tat'' response, saying that sales of american cars, airplanes, iphones and soybeans would suffer and that china could limit the number of students who go to the united states to study.   ''making things difficult for china politically will do him no good,'' the editorial said. ''trump, as a shrewd businessman, will not be so naïve.''   mr. trump is a longtime critic of american trade policies with asian countries, and his pledge to rethink security commitments in japan and south korea has created uncertainty in the region.  china, as a rising superpower, sees both benefits and potential dangers in mr. trump's leadership. some analysts believe his focus on domestic issues might allow china to exert more influence in asia and the pacific. others worry that he may abandon international agreements, such as a landmark accord on climate change reached last year.   li yonghui, dean of the school of international relations and diplomacy at beijing foreign studies university, said in an interview that mr. trump's emphasis on domestic affairs might help ease tensions between the two countries. but he added that chinese leaders needed to prepare for the possibility that mr. trump might increase pressure on beijing, for example, by imposing more restrictions on trade.   ''he's very different from the obama administration when it comes to issues like trade and economics,'' mr. li said. ''there's still a lot of uncertainty.''   get news and analysis from asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the today's headlines: asian morning newsletter. sign up here.	1
if there is one thing donald trump seems sure about, it is that the united states is getting a raw deal from china. to people who spend time studying the united states' economic relationship with china, mr. trump's accounting of its dysfunctions contains both legitimate, accurate complaints and elements that completely misstate how things work between the world's largest and second-largest economies.    ''they're killing us,'' mr. trump has said in many debates, rallies and television appearances. he has threatened to put a 45 percent tax on chinese imports ''if they don't behave.''   if you take mr. trump's comments at face value, as president he would try to renegotiate a complex set of ties that has pulled hundreds of millions of chinese out of dire poverty, made a wide range of goods available to american consumers at more affordable prices and contributed to the decline of american manufacturing.    here is a reality check on mr. trump's arguments. (it's also a way to understand the economic relationship between the countries.)   ''we have very unfair trade with china. we're going to have a trade deficit of $505 billion this year with china.'' -- mr. trump   america's trade deficit with china was $338 billion last year, and there's no reason to think it would swing by as much as mr. trump suggests in 2016 -- but what's $167 billion among codependent trading partners? (mr. trump seems to be conflating the china number with the $505 billion total american trade deficit in 2014, which was first reported to be that much.)   the central point, that the united states imports a lot more from china than it exports, is correct. to put it a bit differently, from 1999 to 2015 annual imports from china rose by $416 billion. in the same span, american exports to china rose by $145 billion.   that said, many economists would argue that a trade balance shouldn't be viewed as a simple scorecard in which the country with the trade deficit is the loser and the one with the surplus the winner.   so the question isn't whether there is a persistent, large trade deficit between the united states and china, but why. and that leads to another arm of mr. trump's argument, and one of the stronger ones.   ''i have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into china. they can't. china won't let them.'' -- mr. trump   it's not that american multinational companies -- heavy industry, technology or finance -- can't do business in china. rather, their executives complain of chinese government restrictions that they see as arbitrary, unpredictable and highly favorable to domestic companies -- so much so that in practice they are either shut out or can't make money in china.   doing business in china typically requires a partnership with a chinese company, and that often means sharing crucial intellectual property that can enable the partner to become a competitor down the road. the rules of engagement can change capriciously, especially for american and european companies, rendering major investments worthless.   american business interests have a long list of complaints: that the chinese government uses its enforcement of antimonopoly rules to favor its domestic businesses; that the government subsidizes exports through tax rebates and other practices; that automakers can set up factories within china only as part of joint ventures and face stiff tariffs in trying to sell cars made in the united states.   the united states government has pushed china on these ''market access'' issues for years. but the situation seems to be growing worse, at least in the opinion of american executives. the american chamber of commerce in china regularly surveys its members about business conditions, and this year 57 percent of executives surveyed named ''inconsistent regulatory interpretation and unclear laws'' as a top problem, up from 37 percent in 2012.   ''they are the single greatest currency manipulator that's ever been on this planet.'' -- mr. trump   mr. trump's complaint about china's devaluation of its currency has a long, bipartisan tradition. it is also out of date.   it is true that china intervenes in currency markets to influence the price of its renminbi against the dollar. and it is true that a decade ago, both the american government and independent economists tended to think that the interventions served to depress the currency, in the chinese government's deliberate effort to make its exports more price competitive.   but a lot has changed in the last decade. the renminbi was allowed to rise sharply from roughly 2006 to 2015, and is up 23 percent from a decade ago.   and since last summer, china has let the currency drop some, but that appears to be an example not of manipulation, but of letting the price of the currency fall closer to the rate that reflects china's fundamentals given the country's slowing economy. the international monetary fund has argued that the renminbi, also known as the yuan, is no longer undervalued.   ''at least in 2006, 2007 or 2008, the yuan was undervalued -- now it's probably not,'' said derek scissors, a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute and chief economist of china beige book, an information service.   indeed, the chinese government has been trying to restrict capital from flowing out of the country to stop the renminbi from falling any further. it would seem that the chinese government and mr. trump are, for the moment at least, on the same side.   ''what will happen if they don't behave, we will put on a tax of some amount, and it could be a large amount, and we will start building those factories and those plants. instead of in china, we'll build them here.'' -- mr. trump   mr. trump's broader argument is that a generation of unfair economic relations with china (and also mexico, japan and others) is a primary cause of the troubles of american workers.   mainstream economists are more sympathetic to this view now than they were even a few years ago. traditional trade theory holds that the losers from global trade -- factory workers who lose their jobs when that factory moves overseas -- are more than compensated by other opportunities created by a more efficient economy.   new scholarship suggests that the pain from globalization in certain geographic locations may be longer-lasting. one study found that chinese imports from 1999 to 2011 cost up to 2.4 million american jobs.   that said, it's easy to assign too much of the blame for the collapse of manufacturing employment to china or trade more broadly. hundreds of millions of workers across the globe -- many of whom were in dire poverty a generation ago -- have become integrated into the world economy. that's a lot of competition, all in a short span, for american factory workers.   at the same time, factory technology has advanced so that a company can make more stuff with fewer workers. the number of manufacturing workers in the united states has been declining as a share of all jobs nearly continuously since 1943, and the total number of manufacturing jobs peaked in 1979; china's trade with the united states didn't really take off until the 1990s.   in other words, trade has been an important economic force over the last few decades, and the deepening of the united states' ties with china is one of the most important developments in global economics of the last generation. but to look at china as the sole force affecting the ups and downs of american workers misses the mark.   the upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life. follow us on facebook and twitter. sign up for our newsletter.	1
  when donald trump said last week that he will double the american growth rate, his skeptics scoffed. the left doesn't think 4 percent growth is possible because they never came close to that target under obama.     but there's no law of nature or economics that says america is doomed to anemic growth rates. we believe with the right policy fixes that fast growth is not just possible, but probable.    in the 1980s the reagan agenda had quarterly growth rates of 6, 7 and even 8 percent. one month recorded 1 million new jobs. now that's a recovery. and trump is right that if india and china can grow at 8 to 10 percent, surely we can aspire to half that growth rate.    faster growth of the economy is imperative if america is to retain our world superpower status - especially given the new rivalry of fast-growing china. this requires the new trump plan, which will take american competitiveness seriously.    first, trump will enact the biggest pro-growth tax cut since ronald reagan's 1981 reform. trump will simplify the tax code and significantly reduce marginal rates, encouraging investment and economic expansion. his proposed corporate tax rate of 15 percent would make it easier for american firms to repatriate earnings, bringing capital back to these shores.    the house tax bill is similar to trump's. we can get this through congress in the first 150 days. the tax foundation says this will add about $150 billion in higher output.    next, a pro-growth energy policy would develop all of america's abundant resources - oil, natural gas and coal. trump's plan could make america the world's no. 1 energy producer within five years, producing millions of new jobs and trillions of dollars of extra output - along with new royalty payments to the government. and we will not waste hundreds of billions of dollars subsidizing 500 million solar panels - mostly built in china.    obamacare is obama-gone. it's the fastest-growing entitlement program of all, and it will be replaced with a consumer-choice health plan. this will cut costs for families and businesses by as much as 30 percent.    on the regulatory front, trump wants to immediately repeal dozens of president obama's anti-business executive orders. at the top of the stack to go in the dust bin is the clean power plant law that has put tens of thousands of our coal miners out of work.   trump would also bring an america-first, pro-business approach to economic policy. having someone in the white house who knows how to run a business and meet a payroll has to be a psychological lift for this battered and bruised economy. 	1
  japanese prime minister shinzo abe trekked to trump tower on thursday, seeking clarity on the president-elect's positions on trade agreements and us-asian alliances.     faced with a nuclear-armed and unpredictable north korea and a newly assertive china, both japan and south korea rely on us leadership and close military, diplomatic and trade ties with washington.    if donald trump calls the relationship into question - as he did repeatedly on the campaign stump - it will mark a historic geopolitical shift.    unmoored from washington, japan and south korea may feel obliged to develop nuclear arsenals of their own or cut deals with us rival beijing.    if trump makes good on his protectionist rhetoric, or labels china a currency manipulator, he could spark a global trade war. but if he moves to protect regional allies' interests against china, he could win friends.     abe arrived at the fifth avenue skyscraper in late afternoon and entered through a side entrance, dodging reporters.  ,  	1
  tech stocks on monday got whacked for a fourth straight day as investors braced for a possible trade war with china under a donald trump presidency.    a get-tough strategy with china could lead to stiff tariffs being placed on products imported from that country - hurting sales.     tech giants like apple, facebook, amazon and alphabet are down sharply since trump's nov. 8 victory.    apple shares bore the brunt of the downdraft on monday, falling 2.5 percent, after a government-controlled newspaper in china warned that "iphone sales will suffer a setback" if trump follows through on campaign threats to "wreck" us-china trade relations.    the nyse-listed shares of alibaba, the chinese e-commerce giant led by billionaire jack ma, were also battered, falling 3.5 percent - and are down more than 10 percent since election day.    the apple selloff came despite pleas from analysts that the iphone maker, which holds more than $230 billion in cash overseas, could be the biggest beneficiary of trump's proposal to dangle tax breaks for companies looking to repatriate their holdings.    shares of amazon - whose billionaire boss jeff bezos had joked before the election about using one of his rockets to send trump into space - lost 2.7 percent monday, to close at $719.07.    that capped a losing streak that has left amazon down 8.7 percent since trump's election - a bloodbath that slashed nearly $6 billion from bezos's paper wealth, leaving him with just $62.9 billion.    elsewhere, shares of facebook and google parent alphabet may have gotten slammed simply because they were tech stocks, as money managers dumped them to chase more trump-friendly sectors, including banks, pharmaceuticals and defense.    "it appears to be a bit of a rotation among sectors," said kevin walkush, portfolio manager at jensen investment management.     also hard hit were tesla motors and solarcity, whose proposal to merge is coming to a vote later this week.  	1
washington -- president trump upended america's traditional, bipartisan trade policy on monday as he formally abandoned the ambitious, 12-nation trans-pacific partnership brokered by his predecessor and declared an end to the era of multinational trade agreements that defined global economics for decades. with the stroke of a pen on his first full weekday in office, mr. trump signaled that he plans to follow through on promises to take a more aggressive stance against foreign competitors as part of his ''america first'' approach. in doing so, he demonstrated that he would not follow old rules, effectively discarding longstanding republican orthodoxy that expanding global trade was good for the world and america -- and that the united states should help write the rules of international commerce.    although the trans-pacific partnership had not been approved by congress, mr. trump's decision to withdraw not only doomed former president barack obama's signature trade achievement, but also carried broad geopolitical implications in a fast-growing region. the deal, which was to link a dozen nations from canada and chile to australia and japan in a complex web of trade rules, was sold as a way to permanently tie the united states to east asia and create an economic bulwark against a rising china.    instead, mr. trump said american workers would be protected against competition from low-wage countries like vietnam and malaysia, also parties to the deal.   but some in both parties worry that china will move to fill the economic vacuum as america looks inward, and will expand its sway over asia and beyond.   monday was a busy day for the new president. in addition to abandoning the trade deal, he ordered a freeze on federal government hiring, except for the military and other security agencies. he reinstituted a ban on federal funding for overseas family planning groups that assist or counsel women seeking abortions. he met with congressional, labor and business leaders. and he promised to cut up to 75 percent of federal regulations.   mr. trump's decision to scrap the trans-pacific partnership, or t.p.p., reversed a free-trade strategy adopted by presidents of both parties dating back to the cold war, and aligned him more with the political left. when he told a meeting of union leaders at the white house on monday that he had just terminated the pact, they broke into applause.   ''we're going to stop the ridiculous trade deals that have taken everybody out of our country and taken companies out of our country, and it's going to be reversed,'' mr. trump told them, saying that from now on, the united states would sign trade deals only with individual allies. ''i think you're going to have a lot of companies come back to our country.''   mr. trump may also move quickly to renegotiate the north american free trade agreement. he is scheduling meetings with the leaders of canada and mexico, the two main partners in that pact, which was negotiated by president george bush and pushed through congress by president bill clinton. while nafta has been a major driver of american trade for nearly two decades, it has long been divisive, with critics blaming it for lost jobs and lower wages.   but free-trade advocates said that in canceling the pacific pact, mr. trump lost an agreement that had already renegotiated nafta under more modern rules governing intellectual property, internet access and agriculture, since both mexico and canada were signatories. he also undercut mr. obama's so-called pivot to asia and, critics said, essentially ceded the field to china, which was not part of the agreement.   ''there's no doubt that this action will be seen as a huge, huge win for china,'' michael b. froman, the trade representative who negotiated the pact for mr. obama, said in an interview. ''for the trump administration, after all this talk about being tough on china, for their first action to basically hand the keys to china and say we're withdrawing from our leadership position in this region is geostrategically damaging.''   some republicans agreed, but only a few would publicly challenge the president. senator john mccain of arizona called the decision ''a serious mistake'' that would hurt america. ''it will send a troubling signal of american disengagement in the asia-pacific region at a time we can least afford it,'' he said in a statement.   the obama administration negotiated the trade pact for nearly eight years. speaker paul d. ryan and other congressional republicans worked with mr. obama to pass legislation granting so-called fast-track authority to negotiate it over democratic objections. but mr. obama never submitted the final agreement for approval amid vocal opposition.   the agreement, the largest regional trade accord ever, brought together the united states and 11 other nations in a free-trade zone for about 40 percent of the world's economy. it was intended to lower tariffs while establishing rules for resolving trade disputes, setting patents and protecting intellectual property.   obama officials argued that it benefited the united states by opening markets while giving up very little in return. in particular, it finally brought the united states and japan, the world's largest and third-largest economies, together in a free-trade pact.   mr. trump's decision was crushing for japan, where prime minister shinzo abe spent considerable political capital to get the agreement through parliament, which ratified it friday. just hours before mr. trump dispensed with it, mr. abe told parliament that tokyo would lobby the new administration on the merits of the deal.   japan was the last to join the pact, which would give its manufacturers tariff-free access to export markets in the united states and other asian countries, but would bring its automakers into competition with lower-wage countries like mexico. mr. abe became a strong enthusiast after making politically painful concessions on agricultural imports that the united states had sought.  china, by contrast, welcomed mr. trump's move, although its leaders will probably relish the moment quietly. given mr. trump's harsh attacks on china and his appointment of a leading china critic, peter navarro, to the new post of trade council director, beijing is bracing for a potentially combative relationship.   victor shih, an expert on china's political economy at the university of california, san diego, said withdrawing from the t.p.p. would alter america's image in the region. ''the u.s. will be seen as an unreliable partner both economically and perhaps even in the security arena,'' he said. ''while some countries in asia have no choice but to be close to the u.s., others may begin to look to china.''  china has already sought to capitalize by making a push to complete an alternative pact, the regional comprehensive economic partnership, which aims to unite 10 members of the association of southeast asian nations with japan, south korea, australia, new zealand and india.   australia's trade minister, steven ciobo, said on monday that other members of the trade pact were exploring whether to create a ''t.p.p. minus one,'' without the united states.   ''the t.p.p. offers very material benefits for all parties that signed up for the agreement,'' he said in an interview. ''it would be a great shame to lose those benefits. notwithstanding president trump's decision, there's still a lot of merits to capturing those gains.''   if mr. trump scrambled coalitions overseas, he did so at home, too. democrats and labor groups praised his move. james p. hoffa, general president of the teamsters union, said mr. trump had ''taken the first step toward fixing 30 years of bad trade policies.'' lori wallach, director of public citizen's global trade watch, said it would ''bury the moldering corpse'' of the pacific deal, though she expressed concern about how nafta would be renegotiated.   some people emerging from the union meeting with mr. trump, who won surprising victories in midwestern labor strongholds, expressed enthusiasm for both his trade action and his promise to build new roads, bridges and other infrastructure.   ''we just had probably the most incredible meeting of our careers,'' sean mcgarvey, president of north america's building trades unions, said. ''we will work with him and his administration to help him implement his plans on infrastructure, trade and energy policy, so we really do put america back to work.''   get politics and washington news updates via facebook, twitter and in the morning briefing newsletter.	1
washington -- terry branstad, the iowa governor who has long embraced china as a market for his state's pork and soybeans, was tapped wednesday by president-elect donald j. trump to represent the united states in one of its most complex and increasingly contentious foreign relationships, as his ambassador to china. in choosing mr. branstad, 70, an amiable politician who likes to describe president xi jinping of china as an ''old friend,'' mr. trump sounded a softer note alongside his unrelenting criticism of china's economic relationship with the united states.     at an event on wednesday morning at cipriani restaurant in manhattan to raise money for his inauguration, mr. trump told the audience that mr. branstad was a great choice. ''he knows them all,'' mr. trump said three separate times, according to an attendee. the selection was first reported by bloomberg news.  china was quick to embrace the choice, even before mr. trump's announcement. at a regular news briefing in beijing on wednesday, lu kang, a spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs, described mr. branstad as ''an old friend of the chinese people,'' a phrase used to describe politicians trusted by beijing. ''we would welcome him playing a bigger role in promoting sino-american relations,'' mr. lu said of mr. branstad.   as ambassador, mr. branstad would find himself in the middle of an increasingly fraught relationship. mr. trump campaigned against china, repeatedly describing chinese imports to the united states as a form of theft. he has proposed a steep tariff on those imports and promised to seek vigorous enforcement of trade rules, such as restrictions on state support for private companies.   the selection also comes just days after mr. trump spoke with taiwan's president by phone, prompting criticism from beijing, which regards taiwan as a breakaway province. mr. trump then defended the call in a pair of twitter messages criticizing china for its trade practices and provocative moves in the south china sea.   mr. branstad is unusual in that he would have personal relationships with the leaders of both countries. like many of the president-elect's choices for senior positions in his administration, the governor was an early and unwavering supporter of mr. trump's candidacy. one of the governor's sons, eric, ran the trump campaign in iowa. another son, marcus, has gone hunting with mr. trump's eldest son, donald jr.   robert hormats, a former under secretary of state in the obama administration and now a vice chairman of kissinger associates, praised the choice.   ''it's a good pick because he knows president xi, he can represent the heartland of the united states, which i think is very positive, and the fact that president xi has been in his state twice is a very positive thing,'' mr. hormats said wednesday in china. ''it creates a personal relationship that is very hard to replicate.''   mr. branstad, an iowa native, graduated from the university of iowa and then served briefly in the army -- yielding a priceless story about his role in arresting jane fonda for trespassing at fort bragg.   a lawyer by training, he entered the iowa legislature in 1973 and won election as governor in 1983. he served until 1999, then returned to office in 2011. in between, he was president of des moines university.   mr. branstad first met mr. xi in 1985, when as the first-term governor of iowa he hosted a chinese delegation that came to study american agricultural practices. the delegation included a 31-year-old official from rural hebei province, mr. xi.   mr. xi has fondly recalled that visit. he stayed in muscatine, a small city in the eastern part of the state, where he was hosted by a couple and slept in their boys' vacated bedroom, filled with ''star trek'' action figures. in early 2012, mr. xi briefly revisited muscatine as vice president while preparing for his promotion to communist party leader later that year. he became the president in 2013.   ''you can't even imagine what a deep impression i had from my visit 27 years ago to muscatine, because you were the first group of americans that i came into contact with,'' he told a group that included mr. branstad during his visit there. ''my impression of the country came from you. for me, you are america.''   during his second stay in the governor's mansion, mr. branstad has aggressively courted china as a market for iowa's produce. he has said little in public about the tensions over territorial disputes, north korea's nuclear weapons, and human rights restrictions in china that have shaped relations at the national level.   iowa, like the rest of the united states, runs a trade deficit with china. the chinese buy food from the united states, including iowa's corn and pork. but americans buy far more from china -- a range of goods that can be surveyed at walmart.   the united states imported $483 billion in goods and services from china last year, while exporting $116 billion to china. the numbers are similar this year.   as governor, mr. branstad has sought to increase american exports without criticizing chinese imports, the standard republican party line before mr. trump's ascendence.   ''i am excited to catch up with our old friend, xi jinping,'' mr. branstad said during a trade mission to china in 2013, which included a meeting with the new chinese president. ''the value of this relationship cannot be overstated. as a result, iowa is the preferred provider to feed china's growing population and our agriculture exports to china continue to grow.''   mr. trump has taken a very different line on that relationship. he has said repeatedly that china is suppressing the value of its currency, an outdated accusation. in recent years, china has intervened in exchange markets to prop up the value of its currency, manipulation that tends to benefit american exporters.   if mr. branstad is confirmed by the senate, iowa would get its first female governor. lt. gov. kim reynolds, 57, would take mr. branstad's place.   get politics and washington news updates via facebook, twitter and in the morning briefing newsletter.	1
for the foreseeable future, no relationship is more vital to international stability than that between the united states and china. yet donald trump and the chinese authorities have foolishly introduced dangerous new uncertainties into the equation. china resolved a potential crisis on tuesday by returning an underwater research drone that it had seized on dec. 15 from a united states navy ship in international waters near the philippines. still, the episode stoked fresh tensions and gave mr. trump an excuse to double down on his campaign promise to adopt a tougher and less predictable line toward beijing.    mr. trump began this month by taking a postelection phone call from the president  of taiwan, tsai ing-wen, and a week later suggested that he might jettison the united states' longstanding acceptance of a ''one-china'' policy. it's unclear what mr. trump means by this, or if he understands the threat that a breakdown in relations would pose for taiwan, an american partner, as well for broader american interests in asia. or maybe he understands and just doesn't care.    maintaining a delicate balance on taiwan's status has been a foundational principle of united states-china relations and crucial to maintaining peace in asia. beijing considers taiwan a renegade region that will eventually be incorporated in china, by force if necessary. since 1978, the united states has recognized beijing as china's sole government, breaking diplomatic ties with taiwan a year later, but washington continues to have unofficial ties with taiwan, sells weapons to the self-governing island, and has hinted it may defend taiwan if it is attacked.   mr. trump told fox news recently that he might reconsider the one-china policy as a way to exact chinese concessions in disputes over currency manipulations, trade and beijing's moves to claim rocks and reefs in the south china sea. he may think he is making an opening bid, but for china, taiwan's status is nonnegotiable.   such talk, some experts fear, might mean that mr. trump would formally recognize taiwan or embolden taiwan to declare independence from china, either of which would bring swift reprisals. alternatively, some worry that if china offers the right deal, mr. trump might abandon taiwan by ending cooperation and billions of dollars in arms sales. such a shift would shake the foundations of every international alliance and partnership the united states has spent decades building.  china, the world's second-largest economy, is america's largest trading partner, besides being a nuclear power and a veto-wielding member of the united nations security council. heedless of these concerns, mr. trump has threatened to slap 45 percent tariffs on china and start a trade war that would penalize american consumers, who would have to pay more for imported chinese goods. it would also hurt american businesses that seek to sell their products in the chinese market. beijing has already thrown a punch, warning last week that it could place sanctions against general motors or ford for monopolistic behavior, possibly as a response to an unfavorable shift in american policy.   there are plenty of ways for china to retaliate, from breaking off diplomatic relations if the united states formally recognizes taiwan to buying planes from europe's airbus instead of boeing, to refusing to help curb north korea's nuclear program. there could also be more shows of force like the chinese fighter jets that flew close to taiwan late last month. and china could also restrict its investments and tourism to taiwan, which would not be good for the island or the region.   it's not uncommon for new presidents to put their own stamp on policy, even longstanding policy. but this requires assembling a staff and conducting a full review of the impact of any changes. mr. trump has few asia experts in his circle, and some advisers have urged him to take up a hard line without any sense of long-term repercussions in the region.   president obama tried to manage a more assertive china by pursuing deeper military cooperation with smaller asian nations and negotiating the trans-pacific partnership, a 12-nation agreement setting higher standards for trade. mr. trump has firmly rejected that deal, with no interest in renegotiating it. his early moves show only his intent to be a disrupter, no matter the consequences to american security.   follow the new york times opinion section on facebook and twitter (@nytopinion), and sign up for the opinion today newsletter. 	2
if there is one thing donald trump seems sure about, it is that the united states is getting a raw deal from china. to people who spend time studying the united states' economic relationship with china, mr. trump's accounting of its dysfunctions contains both legitimate, accurate complaints and elements that completely misstate how things work between the world's largest and second-largest economies.    ''they're killing us,'' mr. trump has said in many debates, rallies and television appearances. he has threatened to put a 45 percent tax on chinese imports ''if they don't behave.''   if you take mr. trump's comments at face value, as president he would try to renegotiate a complex set of ties that has pulled hundreds of millions of chinese out of dire poverty, made a wide range of goods available to american consumers at more affordable prices and contributed to the decline of american manufacturing.    here is a reality check on mr. trump's arguments. (it's also a way to understand the economic relationship between the countries.)   ''we have very unfair trade with china. we're going to have a trade deficit of $505 billion this year with china.'' -- mr. trump   america's trade deficit with china was $338 billion last year, and there's no reason to think it would swing by as much as mr. trump suggests in 2016 -- but what's $167 billion among codependent trading partners? (mr. trump seems to be conflating the china number with the $505 billion total american trade deficit in 2014, which was first reported to be that much.)   the central point, that the united states imports a lot more from china than it exports, is correct. to put it a bit differently, from 1999 to 2015 annual imports from china rose by $416 billion. in the same span, american exports to china rose by $145 billion.   that said, many economists would argue that a trade balance shouldn't be viewed as a simple scorecard in which the country with the trade deficit is the loser and the one with the surplus the winner.   so the question isn't whether there is a persistent, large trade deficit between the united states and china, but why. and that leads to another arm of mr. trump's argument, and one of the stronger ones.   ''i have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into china. they can't. china won't let them.'' -- mr. trump   it's not that american multinational companies -- heavy industry, technology or finance -- can't do business in china. rather, their executives complain of chinese government restrictions that they see as arbitrary, unpredictable and highly favorable to domestic companies -- so much so that in practice they are either shut out or can't make money in china.   doing business in china typically requires a partnership with a chinese company, and that often means sharing crucial intellectual property that can enable the partner to become a competitor down the road. the rules of engagement can change capriciously, especially for american and european companies, rendering major investments worthless.   american business interests have a long list of complaints: that the chinese government uses its enforcement of antimonopoly rules to favor its domestic businesses; that the government subsidizes exports through tax rebates and other practices; that automakers can set up factories within china only as part of joint ventures and face stiff tariffs in trying to sell cars made in the united states.   the united states government has pushed china on these ''market access'' issues for years. but the situation seems to be growing worse, at least in the opinion of american executives. the american chamber of commerce in china regularly surveys its members about business conditions, and this year 57 percent of executives surveyed named ''inconsistent regulatory interpretation and unclear laws'' as a top problem, up from 37 percent in 2012.   ''they are the single greatest currency manipulator that's ever been on this planet.'' -- mr. trump   mr. trump's complaint about china's devaluation of its currency has a long, bipartisan tradition. it is also out of date.   it is true that china intervenes in currency markets to influence the price of its renminbi against the dollar. and it is true that a decade ago, both the american government and independent economists tended to think that the interventions served to depress the currency, in the chinese government's deliberate effort to make its exports more price competitive.   but a lot has changed in the last decade. the renminbi was allowed to rise sharply from roughly 2006 to 2015, and is up 23 percent from a decade ago.   and since last summer, china has let the currency drop some, but that appears to be an example not of manipulation, but of letting the price of the currency fall closer to the rate that reflects china's fundamentals given the country's slowing economy. the international monetary fund has argued that the renminbi, also known as the yuan, is no longer undervalued.   ''at least in 2006, 2007 or 2008, the yuan was undervalued -- now it's probably not,'' said derek scissors, a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute and chief economist of china beige book, an information service.   indeed, the chinese government has been trying to restrict capital from flowing out of the country to stop the renminbi from falling any further. it would seem that the chinese government and mr. trump are, for the moment at least, on the same side.   ''what will happen if they don't behave, we will put on a tax of some amount, and it could be a large amount, and we will start building those factories and those plants. instead of in china, we'll build them here.'' -- mr. trump   mr. trump's broader argument is that a generation of unfair economic relations with china (and also mexico, japan and others) is a primary cause of the troubles of american workers.   mainstream economists are more sympathetic to this view now than they were even a few years ago. traditional trade theory holds that the losers from global trade -- factory workers who lose their jobs when that factory moves overseas -- are more than compensated by other opportunities created by a more efficient economy.   new scholarship suggests that the pain from globalization in certain geographic locations may be longer-lasting. one study found that chinese imports from 1999 to 2011 cost up to 2.4 million american jobs.   that said, it's easy to assign too much of the blame for the collapse of manufacturing employment to china or trade more broadly. hundreds of millions of workers across the globe -- many of whom were in dire poverty a generation ago -- have become integrated into the world economy. that's a lot of competition, all in a short span, for american factory workers.   at the same time, factory technology has advanced so that a company can make more stuff with fewer workers. the number of manufacturing workers in the united states has been declining as a share of all jobs nearly continuously since 1943, and the total number of manufacturing jobs peaked in 1979; china's trade with the united states didn't really take off until the 1990s.   in other words, trade has been an important economic force over the last few decades, and the deepening of the united states' ties with china is one of the most important developments in global economics of the last generation. but to look at china as the sole force affecting the ups and downs of american workers misses the mark.   the upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life. follow us on facebook and twitter. sign up for our newsletter.	1
syaru shirley lin, a native of taiwan, is a political economist who teaches at both the university of virginia and the chinese university of hong kong. previously she was a partner at goldman sachs, where she was responsible for private equity and venture capital investments in asia and spearheaded the firm's investments in technology start-ups, including alibaba. her new book, ''taiwan's china dilemma,'' published by stanford university press, focuses on the emergence of taiwanese national identity and how it has influenced the island's economic policy toward china over the past three decades. in an interview following president-elect donald j. trump's telephone conversation with president tsai ing-wen of taiwan and his questioning of the one china policy that has long guided washington's dealings with beijing and taipei, ms. lin discussed this surprising break with protocol, taiwan's ambivalence toward economic integration with china and why the united states should review its approach to taiwan.    your book deals with the seeming contradiction of china and taiwan developing closer economic ties, even as taiwanese culture moves further away from china's. how have those trends managed to emerge simultaneously?    once china began to open its economy in the post-mao era, cultural similarities and a common political objective of creating ''one china'' led to an explosion of economic relations across the strait. the chinese economy was highly complementary to taiwan's, and a majority of taiwanese considered themselves ''chinese.'' today, more than two-thirds of taiwan's outward foreign direct investment is to china, which is also taiwan's leading trading partner.   however, as cross-strait economic interdependence grew and as taiwan began to democratize, the residents of the island began to debate what it meant to be taiwanese, a topic that had been taboo for four decades under the authoritarian kuomintang government. at first, taiwan's economic policy toward china oscillated between extreme restriction and extreme liberalization. some taiwanese believed supporting economic liberalization with china was a way of promoting unification, while supporting economic restriction with china was equivalent to preserving a separate taiwan, whether that be simply autonomy or outright independence.   as taiwanese identity has consolidated, with more than 90 percent of taiwanese believing they are in some way ''taiwanese,'' a consensus has emerged that some degree of economic interdependence with china is unavoidable but that overdependence is risky. the extreme economic policy options have therefore lost support. however, support for closer economic relations does not extend to sociopolitical integration. in fact, only 1.5 percent of taiwanese support immediate unification with china, with even less support among young people. but if taiwanese identity is threatened it can become salient again, and extreme options may re-emerge. this was the case in 2014 when taiwan's largest student protest -- known as the sunflower movement -- successfully opposed a service trade pact that had been negotiated with china.   there is an increasing gap between the chinese identity that beijing promotes and the identity taiwanese have come to embrace, which is based on democracy, rule of law and freedom of speech and assembly. beijing's strategy of giving taiwanese economic benefits so that taiwanese will become more inclined toward unification has not been successful. so beijing has increased its pressure by terminating official communications with taiwan, reducing the flow of chinese tourists and ensuring taiwan is excluded from international organizations, even those that could benefit from taiwan's participation.   nonetheless, it is entirely possible for this identity to swing back to become more chinese. this will depend on the strategy beijing employs, especially whether it can create a common identity that includes taiwanese. but if beijing stays the course by imposing economic and diplomatic sanctions while providing economic benefits to a select few, it will create more backlash and resentment -- just as it has in hong kong. alternatively, beijing could choose to close the gap across the strait by fostering democratic values and allowing the emergence of civil society, but this seems highly unlikely at present.   taiwan desperately needs to move away from manufacturing into high-end services. one problem is that taiwan is unable to sign trade agreements with major partners because of beijing's objections. part of tsai's platform was to join the trans-pacific partnership in the second round and to conclude a trade and investment framework agreement with the u.s.  trump's skepticism about free trade agreements throws all of this into question. if the u.s. abandons negotiations on these agreements, taiwan will become more marginalized, especially if it is excluded from the china-led regional comprehensive economic partnership.    your book focuses on the china-taiwan relationship, but what do you make of the recent trump-tsai telephone call and the impact that could have on the cross-strait relationship?   the call president-elect donald trump accepted from president tsai alarmed many experts. some fear the call will destabilize u.s.-china relations, while others saw it as a welcome sign of upgraded u.s.-taiwan relations. i do not believe there is evidence of a major policy change yet. but if trump views taiwan simply as a way to put pressure on beijing, then that would mean taiwan is regarded merely as a means to an end, rather than important to the u.s. in its own right.   i think that supporting a vibrant democracy and insisting on a peaceful solution to the taiwan issue is an appropriate american objective. washington has not reviewed its taiwan policy since the clinton administration, and the prospect that taiwan and china will unify peacefully and voluntarily one day has diminished as the two societies grow further apart. instead of just hoping that its present policy of dissuading both china and taiwan from trying to change the status quo can continue indefinitely, the u.s. needs to review its policy so it will not be reacting to actions initiated by china as it becomes more assertive.    is there a space for ms. tsai's democratic progressive party-led government to find a balance on cross-straits issues that beijing can find acceptable? or do you expect beijing to be obstinate in its attempts to freeze out the d.p.p.?   beijing is the key player in this washington-taipei-beijing triangle because it is the party that most desires a change in the status quo. so far, beijing has actively stonewalled the new tsai administration, just as it did with the earlier d.p.p. government led by chen shui-bian from 2000 to 2008. beijing's refusal to acknowledge taiwan's elected leaders and its insistence on punishing the taiwanese by reducing tourism and trade immediately after tsai's election will only discourage taiwanese from reassuming a chinese identity.   tsai has already made compromises that go too far for many of her supporters. in her inaugural speech, tsai referred to the constitution of the republic of china and the legislation governing cross-strait relations, both of which imply the acceptance of a ''one china'' framework. tsai may not have room to move much further, especially if beijing continues to freeze out the d.p.p.   get news and analysis from asia and
