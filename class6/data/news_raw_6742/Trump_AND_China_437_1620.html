<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The alt-right, an extremist fringe popular with white supremacists, has celebrated the election of Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and now hopes to have the ear of his White House.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction Appended</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - By the time Richard B. Spencer, the leading ideologue of the alt-right movement and the final speaker of the night, rose to address a gathering of his followers on Saturday, the crowd was restless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 11 hours of speeches and panel discussions in a federal building named after Ronald Reagan a few blocks from the White House, a succession of speakers had laid out a harsh vision for the future, but had denounced violence and said that Hispanic citizens and black Americans had nothing to fear. Earlier in the day, Mr. Spencer himself had urged the group to start acting less like an underground organization and more like the establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now his tone changed as he began to tell the audience of more than 200 people, mostly young men, what they had been waiting to hear. He railed against Jews and, with a smile, quoted Nazi propaganda in the original German. America, he said, belonged to white people, whom he called the &quot;children of the sun,&quot; a race of conquerors and creators who had been marginalized but now, in the era of President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, were &quot;awakening to their own identity.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he finished, several audience members had their arms outstretched in a Nazi salute. Mr. Spencer called out: &quot;Hail </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hail our people!&quot; and then, &quot;Hail victory!&quot; - the English translation of the Nazi exhortation &quot;Sieg Heil!&quot; The room shouted back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are exultant times for the alt-right movement, which was little known until this year, when it embraced Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign and he appeared to embrace it back. He chose as his campaign chairman Stephen K. Bannon, the media executive who ran the alt-right's most prominent platform, Breitbart News, and then named him as a senior adviser and chief strategist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the movement's leaders hope to have, if not a seat at the table, at least the ear of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many of its racist views are well known - that President Obama is, or may as well be, of foreign birth; that the Black Lives Matter movement is another name for black race rioters; that even the American-born children of undocumented Hispanic immigrants should be deported - the alt-right has been difficult to define. Is it a name for right-wing political provocateurs in the internet era? Or is it a political movement defined by xenophobia and a dislike for political correctness?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conference on Saturday, Mr. Spencer, who said he had coined the term, defined the alt-right as a movement with white identity as its core idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've crossed the Rubicon in terms of recognition,&quot; Mr. Spencer said at the conference, which was sponsored by his organization, the National Policy Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while much of the discourse at the conference was overtly racist and demeaning toward minorities, for much of the day the sentiments were expressed in ways that seemed intended to not sound too menacing. The focus was on how whites were marginalized and beleaguered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One speaker, Peter Brimelow, the founder of Vdare.com, an anti-immigration website, asked why, if Hispanics had the National Council of La Raza and Jews had the Anti-Defamation League, whites were reluctant to organize for their rights. Some speakers made an effort to distance themselves from more notorious white power organizations like the Ku Klux Klan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the night wore on and most reporters had gone home, the language changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Spencer's after-dinner speech began with a polemic against the &quot;mainstream media,&quot; before he briefly paused. &quot;Perhaps we should refer to them in the original German?&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The audience immediately screamed back, &quot;L&uuml;genpresse,&quot; reviving a Nazi-era word that means &quot;lying press.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Spencer suggested that the news media had been critical of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> throughout the campaign in order to protect Jewish interests. He mused about the political commentators who gave Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> little chance of winning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One wonders if these people are people at all, or instead soulless golem,&quot; he said, referring to a Jewish fable about the golem, a clay giant that a rabbi brings to life to protect the Jews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election, Mr. Spencer said, was &quot;the victory of will,&quot; a phrase that echoed the title of the most famous Nazi-era propaganda film. But Mr. Spencer then mentioned, with a smile, Theodor Herzl, the Zionist leader who advocated a Jewish homeland in Israel, quoting his famous pronouncement, &quot;If we will it, it is no dream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States today, Mr. Spencer said, had been turned into &quot;a sick, corrupted society.&quot; But it was not supposed to be that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America was, until this last generation, a white country designed for ourselves and our posterity,&quot; Mr. Spencer thundered. &quot;It is our creation, it is our inheritance, and it belongs to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the white race, he added, is &quot;a race that travels forever on an upward path.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be white is to be a creator, an explorer, a conqueror,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More members of the audience were on their feet as Mr. Spencer described the choice facing white people as to &quot;conquer or die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of other races, Mr. Spencer said: &quot;We don't exploit other groups, we don't gain anything from their presence. They need us, and not the other way around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ties between the alt-right movement and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> team are difficult to define, even by members of the alt-right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bannon was the chief executive of Breitbart, an online news organization that has fed the lie that Mr. Obama is a Kenyan-born Muslim. As recently as last year, Breitbart published an op-ed article urging that &quot;every tree, every rooftop, every picket fence, every telegraph pole in the South should be festooned with the Confederate battle flag.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bannon told Mother Jones this year that Breitbart was now &quot;the platform for the alt-right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in an interview last week with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Bannon said that the alt-right was only &quot;a tiny part&quot; of the viewpoint represented on Breitbart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our definition of the alt-right is younger people who are anti-globalists, very nationalist, terribly anti-establishment,&quot; he told The Journal, adding that the alt-right had &quot;some racial and anti-Semitic overtones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked about Mr. Bannon, the conference's speakers said that they might have shaken his hand on occasion, but that they did not know him well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brimelow said that he had met &quot;Mr. Bannon once, earlier this summer, before he ascended to Olympus.&quot; He said he had told Mr. Bannon that he was doing great work at Breitbart. &quot;He agreed,&quot; Mr. Brimelow recalled to the audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr. Brimelow said he had met him about 30 years ago at a &quot;conservative affinity meeting&quot; in Manhattan. But that was it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Steve Bannon are not alt-right people,&quot; Mr. Brimelow said, adding that they had opportunistically seized on two issues that the alt-right cares most about - stopping immigration and fighting political correctness - and used them to mobilize white voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Spencer said that while he did not think the president-elect should be considered alt-right, &quot;I do think we have a psychic connection, or you can say a deeper connection, with Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a way that we simply do not have with most Republicans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White identity, he said, is at the core of both the alt-right movement and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> movement, even if most voters for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;aren't willing to articulate it as such.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At various points, he and other speakers outlined where they differed from Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. They see him as too beholden to Israel. They do not see any reason to start a trade war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and they are not necessarily opposed to the Iran nuclear deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For them, immigration is the most potent mobilizing issue, less for economic reasons than because of the prospect that white Americans will someday represent less than half of the population of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the alt-right, the most exciting thing about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was that he built a campaign around the issues that mattered most to them, and that white people had voted for him in numbers that left the political establishments of both parties stunned. Now, Mr. Spencer said, it is up to the alt-right to formulate the ideas and policies to guide the new administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we can be the ones out in front, thinking about those things he hasn't quite grasped yet, who are putting forward policies,&quot; Mr. Spencer said, that &quot;have a realistic chance of being implemented.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction: November 24, 2016, Thursday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday described a speech in Washington by Richard B. Spencer, president of the white-nationalist National Policy Institute. At the end of the speech, Mr. Spencer and audience members shouted versions of Nazi slogans, as some audience members raised their arms in the Nazi salute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Times reporter in the hall heard audience members shout &quot;Heil victory!&quot; and other exhortations. A video of the scene, released after the article was published, showed that Mr. Spencer himself shouted &quot;Hail victory!&quot; - the English translation of the Nazis' &quot;Sieg Heil!&quot; - as well as &quot;Hail </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot; and &quot;Hail our people!&quot; (Mr. Spencer did not use the German &quot;Heil,&quot; as the original article suggested.)</SPAN></P>
