<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Here's what you need to know to start your day.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anis Amri, the suspect in the attack at a Berlin Christmas market, was killed in a shootout on the outskirts of Milan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a timeline of events in the life of Mr. Amri: his crossing of the Mediterranean, the years spent in Italian prisons and his contact with a Salafist preacher. His journey also underscores a vexing problem: how to handle masses of virtually stateless wanderers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Berliners returned to Christmas markets after Monday's attack, the mood was subdued.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany arrested two Kosovar brothers on suspicion of planning an attack on a shopping mall. Separately, Australia also said it believed it had averted a terrorist plot in Melbourne - possibly on Christmas Day - with the arrest of five people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> added more turbulence to U.S. foreign policy, posting on Twitter that the country should greatly &quot;expand its nuclear capability&quot; after comments by the Russian president. He also pressured President Obama to veto a United Nations resolution critical of Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team is asking employees at the State Department to give details of gender equality programs, fanning fears of a rollback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Obama administration is dismantling a dormant national registry program for visitors from countries with active terrorist groups after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seemed to suggest that the attack on a Christmas market in Germany validated his proposal to bar Muslims from entering the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Syrian government controls all of Aleppo for the first time since 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last evacuations from rebel-held areas of the city represent a turning point in the war and a morale-building victory for President Bashar al-Assad's troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Italy's government approved the creation of a 20 billion euro fund to support the country's troubled banking industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monte dei Paschi di Siena is the first in line to receive state funds after the bank said that it failed to raise sufficient capital from investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two Baltic cities are in a feud over which had the world's first decorated Christmas tree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riga, the capital of Latvia, says it was first, in 1510. Estonia's Tallinn claims a much earlier event, in 1441. Civic pride and tourist dollars are at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The year in pictures: 2016 was so unexpected, so tumultuous that the fight has just begun over which narrative might possibly explain it. These images might help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deutsche Bank announced a tentative $7.2 billion settlement to resolve a U.S. federal investigation into the sale of toxic mortgage securities. Credit Suisse settled similar claims for $5.3 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Justice Department announced a lawsuit against the British lender Barclays over mortgage securities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Iran agreed to buy 100 Airbus jets in the country's biggest deal with Europe since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Deliveries start next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uber drivers are set to block traffic at Paris airports today amid a dispute over a rise in commissions the company takes from its drivers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ikea reached a tentative settlement to pay $50 million to three American families whose young children were killed after furniture sold by the Swedish company fell on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The European Investment Bank has started providing a one billion euro credit line to Greek banks to support smaller companies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the News</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all know what it's like to get a less-than-ideal gift. Compare your own this season with some of the oddities our journalists have received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alissa J. Rubin, our Paris bureau chief, remembers that she was given a copper-colored, plasticky statuette of an Egyptian sphinx when she covered the war in Iraq: &quot;It had translucent bright blue eyes, and it would light up.&quot; Another one that sticks out: &quot;A Saddam watch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marc Lacey, our national editor and a former international correspondent, still has an Iraqi translator's disconcerting gift: &quot;A painting by an artist said to have painted Saddam Hussein himself, showing a man in a flowing white robe on a majestic white steed holding a sword toward the heavens. He had my face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Yardley, our Europe editor, recalls a range of gifts when he was covering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A plaque with a photograph of a local dam project. A few tea sets. And Olympics swag, including a stuffed doll of one of the Beijing mascots, 'The Friendlies.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Jacobs, a correspondent, remembers another gift to the Beijing bureau: &quot;a compressed Frisbee-sized disc of tea shaped in the image of the Chinese helicopter tycoon who was giving them out.&quot; No one, he says, drank the tea.</SPAN></P>
