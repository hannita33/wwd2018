</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corrections Appended</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to keep New York's crusading United States attorney on board, and is reportedly eyeing the professional wrestling impresario Linda McMahon for the Small Business Administration. And a new name has popped up to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs: Sarah Palin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> eyeing Sarah Palin for Veterans Affairs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Veterans Affairs' massive network of hospitals and clinics has been under a microscope since scandalously long waiting lists and allegations of cover-ups burst into public. The management morass seemed so intractable that in 2014, President Obama pushed out a decorated former general, Eric Shinseki, and hired a former chief executive of Procter &amp; Gamble, Robert A. McDonald, to sort it out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, according to people close to the transition, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is thinking of taking Veterans Affairs in a new direction, handing its reins to former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> passionate campaign pledges to the nation's veterans, the response - if she is chosen - would be ... interesting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A wrestling impresario talks Small Business Administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spotted at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower on Wednesday afternoon: Linda McMahon, the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, an outfit the president-elect has some experience with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Video: Watch Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Take Down WWE's Vince McMahon Back in 2007 Watch on YouTube.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The meeting went great,&quot; she told reporters. &quot;It was really nice to be up, and I was honored to be asked to come in. Anytime I think the president-elect of the United States asks you to come in for a conversation, you're happy to do that. We talked about business and entrepreneurs and creating jobs, and we talked about S.B.A.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her connections to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> go beyond their mutual love of bloated men in spandex suits. Her net worth, estimated at around $855 million, would put her in the same income brackets as the candidates tapped to be the secretaries of Commerce, Treasury and Education, as well as the deputy Commerce secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats push Obama on Russia-election connection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate Democrats, unable to get their Republican counterparts involved, are looking at a new recruit to examine allegations of Russian tampering with the elections: President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter, written by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and signed by fellow members of the intelligence committee, seven senior Democrats asked the president to declassify and release &quot;additional information concerning the Russian Government and the U.S. election.&quot; They cryptically added: &quot;We are conveying specifics through classified channels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal ethics office tweets to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: Divest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Office of Government Ethics is usually a pretty quiet corner of the federal government, but when ethics officials thought that the president-elect had vowed to sell off all of his assets into a blind trust, they came alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a series of Twitter posts, the ethics office was full of praise ... for something Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hasn't actually done yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.@realDonaldTrump We can't repeat enough how good this total divestiture will be - U.S. OGE (@OfficeGovEthics) November 30, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.@realDonaldTrump Brilliant! Divestiture is good for you, very good for America! - U.S. OGE (@OfficeGovEthics) November 30, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.@realDonaldTrump OGE applauds the &quot;total&quot; divestiture decision. Bravo! - U.S. OGE (@OfficeGovEthics) November 30, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And finally, the coup de gr&acirc;ce:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.@realDonalTrump As we discussed with your counsel, divestiture is the way to resolve these conflicts. - U.S. OGE (@OfficeGovEthics) November 30, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.@realDonaldTrump - we told your counsel we'd sing your praises if you divested, we meant it. - U.S. OGE (@OfficeGovEthics) November 30, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not said exactly what he will do, beyond a promised news conference on Dec. 15 to reveal his plans for his business empire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A crusading federal prosecutor stays on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan who has built a reputation as a fierce prosecutor of public corruption cases, said on Wednesday that he intended to remain in office under President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bharara, who was appointed in 2009 by Mr. Obama, disclosed his intention to stay on after emerging from a meeting with the president-elect at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bharara told reporters that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had asked to meet with him to discuss &quot;whether or not I'd be prepared to stay on as the United States attorney to do the work as we have done it, independently, without fear or favor for the last seven years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a good meeting,&quot; Mr. Bharara continued. &quot;I said I would absolutely consider staying on. I agreed to stay on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bharara said that he had already talked to Senator Jeff Sessions, the Republican of Alabama who is Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> choice to be attorney general. &quot;He also asked that I stay on, and so I expect that I will be continuing,&quot; Mr. Bharara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Treasury pick makes promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appearing on the business cable channel CNBC, Steven Mnuchin, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pick for Treasury secretary, made a series of promises and pledges sure to be remembered in the years to come:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tax cuts will be huge, with the corporate tax rate dropping to 15 percent from 35 percent. Mr. Mnuchin said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will be the largest tax change since Reagan. ... We're going to cut corporate taxes, which will bring huge amounts of jobs back to the United States. We're going to get to 15 percent, and we're going to bring a lot of cash back to the U.S.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; But it will provide no net benefit to the rich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be a big tax cut for the middle class. Any tax cuts for the upper class will be offset by less deductions that pay for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details? Not many, but he did hint that he will push to cap the mortgage deduction for mega-mansions and second homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration expects sustained economic growth of 3 percent to 4 percent a year. &quot;That is absolutely critical for the country,&quot; Mr. Mnuchin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critical, perhaps, but difficult, considering the United States has not seen consistent growth like that since the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration will label </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a currency manipulator &quot;if we determine&quot; that's warranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; The top regulatory priority will be eliminating &quot;parts&quot; of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul that discourage lending, but the administration will not push for a full repeal. Mr. Mnuchin:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we look at Dodd-Frank, the No. 1 problem with Dodd-Frank is it's way too complicated, and it cuts back lending. We want to strip back parts of Dodd-Frank that prevent banks from lending. That will be the No. 1 priority on the regulatory side.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More cabinet announcements this week? Maybe not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect is full of surprises, but absent a big one, Wednesday morning's announcements may be all we get for the rest of the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No more @realDonaldTrump Cabinet announcements planned this week, per @seanspicer - Margaret Talev (@margarettalev) November 30, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to Mr. Mnuchin, there were WilburRoss, a billionaire investor, for commerce secretary, and Todd Ricketts, part of the Ameritrade fortune and a part owner of the Chicago Cubs, for deputy commerce secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cabinet, assuming it is confirmed, will be worth billions of dollars (add Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> previously announced education secretary pick, Betsy DeVos of the Amway fortune). But the team is not shying away from its Wall Street and moneyed roots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> today announced his intent to nominate Steven Mnuchin, Wilbur Ross &amp; Todd Ricketts'https://t.co/H3AOpCxplFpic.twitter.com/G9ToTxedjB - Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mnuchin said on CNBC:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the good things about both Wilbur and I - we have actually been bankers. We were the only two people during the financial crisis that were issued licenses by the government. We've been in the business of regional banking and we understand what it is to make loans. That's the engine of growth to small and medium sized businesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Republicans expected to hold 52 seats in the Senate, blocking confirmation would be hard, but Democrats signaled that both men would face tough questioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mnuchin's time atop a Los Angeles bank known for its foreclosures will definitely come up, as suggested by a joint comment released Wednesday by Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the campaign, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told the American people that he was going to change Washington by taking on Wall Street. Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> choice for Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, is just another Wall Street insider. That is not the type of change that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promised to bring to Washington - that is hypocrisy at its worst. After his bank pocketed billions in taxpayer dollars from the bailout, Mnuchin moved on to make a fortune running another bank that aggressively foreclosed on families still reeling from the crisis. This pick makes clear that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to cater to the same Wall Street executives that have hurt working families time and again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Team Twitter: Update your 'following' list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excited to work w/ @RepTomPrice, @ElaineChao, @stevenmnuchin1 &amp; @OfficialWLRoss in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Admin. Lots of work ahead to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain - Reince Priebus (@Reince) November 30, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Depends on your definition of 'populist.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the president-elect himself, his commerce secretary pick, his deputy commerce pick, his education secretary choice and his prospective Treasury secretary, much of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> team ranges from multimillionaires to billionaires. And that doesn't include Ms. McMahon, no slouch on the money front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm told </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition aides want to find a place in the administration for Linda McMahon, who advocates for women in leadership roles. https://t.co/RI8pu40tDj - Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) November 30, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So is the incoming administration truly populist?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anthony Scaramucci, the financier and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition official, had some thoughts Wednesday:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, it depends on how you define populist. If you're talking about an administration that's focused on the potential for the United States and the potential for the American people and where Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to be president for everybody, which includes the working class and the middle class, then I guess by that definition. But I don't know. It depends on what your definition of populist - sometimes there's a misnomer to that definition that's somewhat of a pejorative. I don't see it that way. What I do see is that the people that I grew up with, which are basically the working class people of the United States, they need a break. And we need to switch them from going from the working class into the working poor into what I call the aspirational working class, which my dad was a member of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are millionaires and billionaires really &quot;draining the swamp&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You want some people that are insiders and understand the system, and some outsiders that are creative thinkers, out of the box thinkers and disrupters. If you can get that blend right, then you'll be able to effect change in Washington. I think if you put too many of one or the other, if you have status quo presiders, well nothing's going to change. If you have too many status quo disrupters, Washington is a very healthy immunological system, you'll see a full blown organ rejection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new name in the hopper?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Fallin, Oklahoma's conservative Republican governor, is under consideration for interior secretary. Ms. Fallin had been floated as a potential vice-presidential nominee shortly before the Republican National Convention over the summer. Her aide, Steve Mullins, is also being mentioned for a top staff post if she gets the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And no, Mr. President-elect, it wasn't a landslide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Alabama and New Mexico certifying their votes, an update is in order. Hillary Clinton's popular vote lead over Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> climbed overnight to 2,370,700 - or 1.8 percentage points. Eleven states and the District of Columbia now record a higher percentage of votes for Mrs. Clinton than President Obama received in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says he'll move away from business, but how?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said on Wednesday that he would leave his &quot;great business in total&quot; before moving into the Oval Office, promising further details next month about his efforts to avoid conflicts of interest as he becomes the nation's 45th president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15 to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my ... - Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! While I am not mandated to .... - Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">do this under the law, I feel it is visually important, as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses.. - Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence, legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations. The Presidency is a far more important task! - Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear whether the steps Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is prepared to take would be enough to satisfy ethics experts who say that putting his children in charge of the business would not be enough to ensure that his official decisions are independent of his personal financial ones. His daughter Ivanka has attended a number of meetings with heads of state since the election, and she would be one of the main officers of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with The New York Times last week, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that presidents &quot;can't have a conflict of interest&quot; and that it would be extremely difficult to sell his businesses because they are real estate holdings.</SPAN></P>
