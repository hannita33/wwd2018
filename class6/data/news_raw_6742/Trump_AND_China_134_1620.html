<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Intense jockeying for diplomatic posts has begun among donors and loyalists to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and, in some cases, among people close to his children.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction Appended</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appears to believe he owes little to the Republican establishment donor set, a majority of whom opposed him. He also ran a campaign that challenged longstanding shibboleths of American diplomacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> choice of ambassadors could be a sign of how serious he is about both those stances. But as his transition team begins sifting through possible choices for a dozen major embassies, the signals are unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of his three choices so far, Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and David M. Friedman for Israel, are loyalists, not big donors. The third, Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, picked as ambassador to the United Nations, was an ardent critic of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Mr. Branstad has described President Xi Jinping of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as an &quot;old friend;&quot; Ms. Haley and Mr. Friedman have no diplomatic experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the nomination of Mr. Friedman, a conservative who has been deeply critical of the pro-Israel lobbying group J Street, and who has vowed to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem, has roiled large sections of the foreign policy establishment - just the kind of disruption Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> liked to emphasize in his campaign.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, Mr. Friedman is the exception. As the intense jockeying for ambassadorships has begun among donors, loyalists to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and, in some cases, people close to his children, his advisers have potentially competing priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chooses Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets who is a longtime Republican donor and a friend of the president-elect, or someone like Peter S. Kalikow, the New York developer and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporter, he would be following a familiar script.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he chooses someone like Jon M. Huntsman Jr. for Japan, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be trying to match a Republican establishment figure with a region he is familiar with. Mr. Huntsman has served as ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Singapore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he goes for someone like Robert Pence, a Virginia developer who did not support Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> candidacy but who has been recommended by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, it would fall more in line with his choice of Ms. Haley and of bringing outsiders into the fold. (The two Pences are not related).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The expectation is that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will begin by rewarding supporters with appointments to Western Europe or the Caribbean, as is often the case with new administrations. But they could also include donors to his campaign or transition, people he might need again in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They generally start out more political,&quot; said Asgeir Sigfusson, the communications director for the American Foreign Service Association. &quot;The numbers will even out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In previous administrations, he said, about 70 percent of nominations were foreign service professionals and 30 percent were political appointees. It remains to be seen if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will adhere to that breakdown, Mr. Sigfusson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declined to comment, beyond saying that discussion about candidates was in the early stages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some favorites among the names Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advisers are batting around, however, and meetings on the subject are expected to increase in frequency starting this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aides are sifting through a broad list of recommendations from people involved in the transition process, including the president-elect's daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. As a result, the suggestions have included people who did not immediately support the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ticket, such as Ronald J. Gidwitz, who backed Jeb Bush in the primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been some aspirational suggestions, such as Mr. Huntsman, who served as ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Obama administration, for Japan; or Mich&egrave;le A. Flournoy, a top Pentagon official in the Obama administration, as an ambassador to NATO. The two have deep knowledge of policy and have been spoken of favorably by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief White House strategist. But a number of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> top advisers oppose them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are more personal recommendations from people involved in the transition. One was for Morris Goldfarb, the chief executive of the G-III Apparel Group, which had a licensing agreement for Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> apparel line. Another was former Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia, who has been recommended by Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> adviser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivana </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first wife, cheekily recommended herself to The New York Post for ambassador to the Czech Republic. John Jay LaValle, chairman of the Suffolk County Republican Committee in New York and one of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> few vocal defenders in the campaign's final days, could see a plum post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there are a raft of donors and longtime Republicans angling for appointments who could expect particularly close scrutiny by Democrats during confirmation hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think confirmation is always problematic,&quot; said Mel Sembler, a party fund-raiser appointed ambassador to Australia by the elder President George Bush and to Italy by the younger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first time out, it was a long and embarrassing and difficult process,&quot; Mr. Sembler said. Old scars become new information as senators start their review, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some donors could see old troubles resurface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kalikow, the New York developer, who filed for personal bankruptcy when he owned The New York Post more than two decades ago, has been mentioned for a possible post. So has Georgette Mosbacher, a socialite whose husband, now deceased, was the focus of a lawsuit over a flawed census count in 1990. Neither Mr. Kalikow nor Ms. Mosbacher would comment for this article.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duke Buchan, major supporter of Jeb Bush and a defender of the work of Right to Rise, the &quot;super PAC&quot; backing that candidate, joined the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> effort in the summer and contributed significantly to his campaign. Mr. Buchan has expressed interest in becoming ambassador to Spain, where he says he studied and where a company he once held stock in recently owned property. He also used to own shares in a company that holds military contracts, records show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Buchan, who does not know Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> well, has had blunt discussions about how to best position himself for an ambassadorship, according to people close to the transition. He did not respond to requests for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fred V. Malek, a former aide to President Richard M. Nixon and to the elder President Bush, said that being a donor did not guarantee anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It doesn't mean that somebody can be a fund-raiser and just have an ambassadorship,&quot; he said. &quot;They have to have some credentials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least two prospective candidates from the donor community, according to people with direct knowledge of the discussions, are likely to end up with posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lewis M. Eisenberg, the Republican National Committee finance chairman who raised money with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> choice for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is seen as a possible choice for Italy. Mr. Johnson, the Jets owner, is a leading choice for Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Forgione, who was passed over for secretary of housing and development, has support to become ambassador to the Vatican. So does William E. Simon Jr., an ally of Rudolph W. Giuliani, who recommended him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R. Nicholas Burns, an ambassador to Greece under President Bill Clinton, said that the State Department typically put forward a list of people to consider, and that incoming presidents should be aware of their options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be well advised to broaden the circle of people he consults in making these appointments,&quot; Mr. Burns said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction: December 21, 2016, Wednesday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the corporate role of Morris Goldfarb. He remains the chief executive of the G-III Apparel Group, and did not recently leave that post.</SPAN></P>
