<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has made reversing America's trade imbalance a pillar of his campaign, often portrays himself as uniquely capable of wringing concessions out of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> through hard-nosed business tactics he has honed over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, he says, he has a personal track record to back up his boasts. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I beat </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> all the time,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declared in a speech the day he announced his candidacy. ''I own a big chunk of the Bank of America building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas that I got from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a war. Very valuable.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does have an investment in the building, an office tower near Rockefeller Center. But court documents and interviews with people involved in the deal tell a very different story of how he ended up with it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It began when a group of Hong Kong billionaires, including one who has been called the Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, helped rescue Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the verge of bankruptcy by investing in one of his properties in Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For years, the carefully cultivated relationship between Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his Hong Kong partners proved lucrative for both sides, and stands out as perhaps the closest that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has come to international diplomacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To strike the deal, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had to attend elaborate dinner parties featuring foreign foods he did not want to eat. He delayed the closing because of Chinese spiritual beliefs and hunted around New York for a ''feng shui'' master to help with the building d&eacute;cor, instead of indulging his tastes for marble and gold, according to former associates of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who were involved in the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But when his Hong Kong partners sold the property without his support, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> waged a bitter, long-shot legal battle against them. And far from winning his share of the Bank of America building, according to court documents, he had to settle for it after losing in court. In the end, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> alliance and eventual rivalry with some of Hong Kong's richest men proved to be a tale of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the extremes. It showcased his unflagging confidence in his ability to turn a bad financial situation around. But it also underscored his willingness to destroy a fruitful relationship with aggressive litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Their partnership began in 1994, after the collapse of the real estate market left Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> deeply in debt. He could not afford to make the bank payments on a 77-acre swath of land near Lincoln Center known as Riverside South, let alone to develop the property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In need of cash, he agreed to meet with intermediaries from a consortium of Hong Kong billionaires who were willing to buy the land, assume Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> debts and pay him 30 percent of the profits, as well as fees for helping to manage the development of the site, which they agreed to finance. It was by far the best offer he received. The group included Henry Cheng Kar-shun, one of the world's richest developers, and Vincent Lo, who is Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chinese counterpart in more ways than one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr. Lo comes from a wealthy family. He is well known for creating a hip restaurant area in Shanghai called Xintiandi, or ''new heaven on earth,'' an upscale brand he has replicated across </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. His life has been chronicled by tabloids and society pages, especially his divorce from his first wife and his marriage to a beauty pageant winner, Miss Hong Kong of 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite their similarities, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hesitated when he received an invitation to travel to Hong Kong to negotiate the deal. He does not like to travel, and he feared that negotiating on the Hong Kong developers' turf would put him at a disadvantage and make him appear weak, said Abe Wallach, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> executive vice president of acquisitions and finance at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But face-to-face meetings are crucial in Chinese business culture, where personal bonds and political connections, collectively known as guanxi, are relied upon to avoid and resolve business disputes, sometimes more than the legal system. Eventually, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aides convinced him that he had to make the trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Hong Kong, the golf games, dinner parties and intensive talks featured the awkwardness and cultural miscues that can crop up in any high-stakes international negotiation. Mr. Lo and Mr. Cheng invited Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to play golf, but Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was appalled when they told him they usually bet more than $1,000 on each hole. They ended up betting $100 per hole, and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wound up losing more than he won, Mr. Lo recalled in an interview this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's a good golfer, but we had the local knowledge -- he probably was jet-lagged,'' Mr. Lo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Lo and Mr. Cheng invited Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to dinner at the home of Mr. Cheng's father, an uncommon honor in Chinese culture. But the evening was a trying experience for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He didn't like the food, and couldn't use chopsticks,'' recalled Mr. Wallach, who was there. ''The first course was a whole fish, with the head still on. You could see the face of the fish and the teeth, which really looked grotesque. The servant put the fish in front of Donald. Donald said, 'The honor belongs to Abe.' I took my chopsticks and began to pick at it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Cheng and Mr. Lo also half-jokingly proposed an informal drinking contest, which Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a teetotaler, declined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Hong Kong partners were wary of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> well-earned reputation for litigiousness. But for more than a decade, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> avoided conflict with them. Indeed, he often deferred to them. Chase Manhattan Bank, which held Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mortgage, initially scheduled the closing of the deal during </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghost Month, during which some believe the spirits of the dead roam the earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Chinese told me that we would have to wait until after the fifteenth of September to close the deal,'' Mr. Wallach wrote in a chapter of an unpublished book he is writing about his years with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> went apoplectic.'' But he said that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> went along.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (Mr. Lo said that any delay had been caused by a need to complete paperwork, and that he and his business partners were not superstitious.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The project proved extremely profitable, as the New York real estate market rebounded. In 2005, the Hong Kong partners sold the development for $1.76 billion. Although it was believed to be the largest residential real estate transaction in the city's history, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was furious, and contends to this day that his partners did not consult him first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I said: 'Why didn't you come talk to me? Whatever price you got, I could have gotten more money,''' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recalled in an interview this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Lo said that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been informed of the decision, and that in any case it would have been very hard to shop such a large property around without Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> becoming aware of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead of accepting his share of the proceeds, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sued his partners for ''staggering breach'' of fiduciary duty in a lawsuit that demanded $1 billion in damages. Mr. Lo, who felt that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should have been appreciative of the deal he had received, called the lawsuit ''a shock.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And when the Hong Kong partners sought to invest the proceeds from the sale in Bank of America buildings in San Francisco and New York, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sought an injunction to scuttle the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The judge ruled against him. Instead of receiving the cash he wanted, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had to accept a 30 percent share in the profits from the two Bank of America buildings, tied up in a partnership that is slated to last until 2044. But today, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> counts that legal defeat as a victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Through more luck than talent, I ended up much better because the buildings have increased in value,'' he said. ''In the end, it was fine.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nonetheless, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> litigation over Riverside South dragged on for at least four years. He forced his partners to produce more than 166,000 pages of documents in court and accused them of various transgressions, including fraud and tax evasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During the litigation, Mr. Lo was forced to keep his trips to the United States secret, out of concern that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawyers would serve him with court papers that would force him to remain in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Outside court, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> battle seemed to take the shape of a personal rivalry with Mr. Lo, who had just bankrolled a Chinese reality television show called ''Wise Man Takes All.'' It loosely resembled Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> show ''The Apprentice,'' although Mr. Lo appeared just once on the show and handed out start-up capital to the winners instead of jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> announced that he was going to take a version of ''The Apprentice'' to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to compete with Mr. Lo's show, although Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> show there does not appear to have gotten off the ground. In an interview, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asked a reporter how Mr. Lo's show had turned out, then answered his question: ''Let's put it this way. It wasn't 'The Apprentice,' which was a big success.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Lo said his show had met his real goal of promoting entrepreneurship in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the lawsuit, the Hong Kong partners moved swiftly to cut all ties to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Mr. Lo sold his shares in the partnership to the Cheng family, which sold to Vornado Realty Trust, now the owner of a 70 percent interest in the Bank of America buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in the interview, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sounded almost wistful about his former partners, marveling at the money they had made together and at the fact that they no longer spoke. He acknowledged that his former partners might have gotten the best deal possible on Riverside South, after all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's too bad that this happened,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told a reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If you speak to Vincent and Henry, tell them I think they are fantastic people,'' he said. ''You let them know that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has great respect for them, O.K.?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Eight thousand miles away, in his penthouse office in Hong Kong, Mr. Lo laughed when told of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comment. He made clear that he had not forgotten being sued for $1 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Well, that's him,'' Mr. Lo said. ''To file a lawsuit is nothing. It's just like having lunch.''</SPAN></P>
