<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Much of the surge in pharmaceuticals brought in from outside the U.S. comes from generics, which are generally cheaper than branded medicines.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHANGHAI - First it was cars, then air-conditioners. This week, President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> targeted another industry that has shifted manufacturing abroad: pharmaceuticals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American drug imports have grown significantly in recent years, figures show. At the same time, however, drug costs continue to rise, an issue Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggested his government could address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But any move to curtail pharmaceutical imports could raise, rather than lower, drug prices, experts warn. That is because many of the cheaper drugs in the United States come from abroad.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his news conference on Wednesday, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> denounced pharmaceutical companies for leaving the United States - possibly a reference to firms that have shifted their legal headquarters overseas for tax reasons - and for moving production overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to get our drug industry back,&quot; he said. &quot;Our drug industry has been disastrous. They're leaving left and right. They supply our drugs but they don't make them here, to a large extent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went on to assail the influence of pharmaceutical industry lobbyists in Washington, and he predicted that the federal government could save billions of dollars by relying more on competitive bidding in drug procurement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments conflated a number of challenges for consumers, politicians and the pharmaceutical industry. But imports generally help to keep costs down, because much of the increase in the amount of products from abroad comes from generic drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Generic drugs are those that are no longer covered by patents. While some generics makers have drawn scrutiny over pricing, their products are generally cheaper than the branded medicines made by major pharmaceutical companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;is somewhat looking in the wrong place if he's trying to get imports down,&quot; said Chris Rogers, an analyst at the trade data consulting firm Panjiva.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The companies that are the biggest exporters of generics to the United States take the same position. &quot;Although we have been expanding our exports to the U.S., we are not raising costs as much, which helps the Americans to be able to afford the same medicines at a cheaper rate,&quot; said Snehashish Sen, the manager of costing at Cipla Ltd., one of the largest Indian manufacturers of generic drugs. &quot;I do not see how we are hurting the sector. In fact, by making medicines more affordable, we are helping Americans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a quick analysis of trade data for four common families of pharmaceuticals, Panjiva found that American imports of statins, anticonvulsants and insulins had doubled, while imports of proton-pump inhibitors had risen sixfold over the past five years. The imports consisted heavily of generic drugs, and three-fifths came from India, although Eastern Europe has become an increasingly important supplier as Israeli and Swiss companies set up factories there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three leaders in shipping pharmaceuticals in those four categories to the United States are Indian makers of generic drugs: Dr. Reddy's Laboratories and Aurobindo Pharma Ltd., both in Hyderabad, and Cipla, in Mumbai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remarks came as pharmaceutical officials and experts outside of the United States were already concerned that global demand might be stagnating for a wide range of their products amid broader economic softness and a slowdown in trade. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> total exports of health products, from crutches to drugs, fell 2 percent in the first three quarters of last year compared with the same period a year earlier - the first drop in decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new president of the United States, and Britain leaving the European Union, both indicate the ebb of economic globalization,&quot; said Lin Jianning, the dean of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Food and Drug Administration's economic research institute, in a speech on Nov. 23. &quot;In the long run, it won't bring benefit to the medicine industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The production of pharmaceuticals and other health care products is increasingly global. The main category in United States customs data for pharmaceutical imports - a category that encompasses bandages and most but not all drugs - has surged nearly 50 percent in the past five years, and it is now running at nearly $100 billion a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the more politically delicate questions lies in where the ingredients used to make drugs come from. Many pharmaceutical companies import chemical compounds but finish production, like turning the compounds into pills and packaging them for sale, in the United States. The imports have raised questions about the loss of American jobs, which Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may have been alluding to on Wednesday, and also about quality control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baxter International had to recall heparin, a blood thinner, in 2008 after a spate of severe allergic reactions and more than a dozen deaths. A subsequent investigation linked the allergic reactions to a contaminant introduced during the production process of a Chinese supplier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pall over that episode appears to be lifting, as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shipments of those compounds to the United States nearly quadrupled in the first eight months of last year, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the government-affiliated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chamber of Commerce for the Import and Export of Medicines and Health Products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the numbers remain small - those shipments to the United States totaled only $175 million, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> group said - and Chinese factories are increasingly serving their own market, as well as others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jia Yaxi, an analyst at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economic and Business Monitor, a Shanghai consulting firm, said in an email that exports represented only one-tenth of the Chinese pharmaceutical industry's output. And even that share is falling, as exports stagnate while domestic demand increases steadily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BASF, the German multinational that is the world's largest chemicals company, has invested heavily in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But the company said on Thursday that its exports of early-stage chemicals from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were &quot;mainly&quot; to factories elsewhere in Asia. BASF declined to say where its pharmaceutical customers sent the pills and other products made from the chemicals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for tax inversions, which Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seemed to be alluding to when he mentioned that pharmaceutical companies were &quot;leaving left and right,&quot; those also seem to have slowed. The Obama administration has acted to curb tax provisions that had made it attractive for companies, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry, to move their headquarters to lower-cost jurisdictions.</SPAN></P>
