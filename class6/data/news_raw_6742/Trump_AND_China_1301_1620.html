</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been a year dominated by populist rage, embodied in Bernie Sanders's calls for a political revolution and Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> angry assertions that the United States, and its workers, are losing badly in the global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an economic policy speech on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton gave this message: I alone am the candidate who knows how to turn those underlying frustrations into actual policies that might make things better. She offered herself as someone who would not merely vent voters' anger, but respond to that anger by pulling the levers of the federal bureaucracy and creating legislation that can be scored by the Congressional Budget Office and just maybe pass a Senate committee. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's not easy to change Washington, or how corporations behave,'' Mrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said before exuberant supporters in Raleigh, N.C., a day after a speech blasting Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business record, ethics and often-erratic policy positions. ''It takes more than stern words or a flashy slogan. It takes a plan, and it takes experience and the ability to work with both parties to get results.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Unlike her primary opponent, Mr. Sanders, she did not promise to provide free college tuition or to break up major banks; she instead said she would make sure students could graduate without a debt hangover, and clamp down on banks in ways that would probably lead them to shrink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Unlike her Republican opponent, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, she did not propose ripping up trade deals and risking trade wars with the likes of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mexico. But she did say her administration would use the tax code to punish companies that outsource jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Notably, she also did not proclaim the greatness of the Obama-era economy and pledge continuity. That was a contrast with two other modern-era candidates who ran to succeed a two-term president from their party amid a strong economy, Al Gore in 2000 and George H.W. Bush in 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This carefully rolled-out speech suggests she seeks to run not by boasting of what has gone right in the economy under President Obama, but as a fixer who can more successfully deal with the things that are still broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration has stressed that private-sector job growth has been strong for the last several years and that the unemployment rate is now down to 4.7 percent. But in her speech, Mrs. Clinton emphasized the longer-term divergence between worker productivity and wages, the tendency of companies to view employee compensation as a cost to be minimized. And she spoke of the struggles of the long-term unemployed, people who can find only part-time work, and those who are out of the labor force entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In effect, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged the underlying economic discontent that has fueled the rise of Mr. Sanders and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, while presenting herself as the person best qualified to address it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The bottom line is that too many leaders in business and government have lost sight of our shared responsibility to each other and to our nation,'' she said. ''They let Wall Street take big risks with unregulated financial activities, they skew our tax code toward the wealthy, they failed to enforce our trade rules, they undermined workers' rights.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton thus emphasized policies that have potential for deal making even in a polarized Congress, or that could be executed through administrative action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the first category, she mentioned large-scale investment in public infrastructure, funding long-term investments in the nation's future with a mix of public and private resources. Business interests and many elected Republicans support ideas in this vein, at least in theory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She also mentioned immigration reform as a tool for economic improvement, another idea that businesspeople and many Republicans support. (Recall that an immigration bill created in part by Marco Rubio, who in a slightly different universe might be Mrs. Clinton's general-election opponent, was one vote in the House of Representatives away from becoming law not long ago.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the category of administrative action, Mrs. Clinton was vague but clear about her intention to use the machinery of government to nudge things in workers' favor. She said she would ''continue to crack down on wage theft'' and abuse of overtime rules, suggesting that she would, if anything, seek to expand Obama administration rules to make more workers eligible for time-and-a-half pay and use government authority to fight employers that try to shortchange employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The policy steps she described had mostly been put forward by her campaign already, so it is hard to describe the speech as a step toward the left, in hopes of corralling Sanders voters, or to the center, in hopes of broadening her appeal to the general electorate. Rather, the speech framed her place in the race as being the candidate who understands the populist discontent but will react to it with practicality. That carries risks, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After all, President Obama has spent his entire second term following the same basic strategy of looking for lanes for bipartisan cooperation on things like infrastructure spending and immigration overhaul, while using the federal bureaucracy to try to tilt the playing field toward workers within the confines of current law. As the election advances, Mrs. Clinton will be vulnerable to the charge that she is promising to do the same things as Mr. Obama has, but with the hope of getting better results for American workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Politicians campaign in poetry and govern in prose. Mrs. Clinton's message on Wednesday was that she will campaign and govern with a five-point plan, drawn up by subject-area experts, incorporating the full range of potential legislative and administrative tools available to the next president.</SPAN></P>
