</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other transition news:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; A high-priced auction for coffee with the future first daughter Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appears to have been canceled, as criticism mounted that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trumps</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were selling access.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s son-in-law told business leaders in New York that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be pushing a $1 trillion infrastructure plan closer to the ideal of Democrats than Republicans. At the same event, Senator Chuck Schumer, the incoming minority leader, sounded similarly conciliatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took to Twitter on Friday to again play down Russian interference in the elections - this time, seemingly praising one of the cyberattacks for the revelations it contained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coffee with Ivanka appears to be canceled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family on Friday appears to have canceled a charity auction that featured the president-elect's daughter Ivanka, as criticism mounted that the future first family's charitable solicitation risked opening the White House to special interests seeking to pay for access.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The auction for a chance to spend up to 45 minutes with Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over coffee at either </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in New York or the recently opened </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Hotel in Washington was to continue for another three days. As of Friday morning, the high bid was $72,888.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then the auction disappeared from the Charitybuzz website that had been hosting it, along with details on all the bids that had been offered since it opened on Dec. 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The loser is St. Jude, and the winner I'm not exactly sure,&quot; one of the bidders, the Tex-Mex restaurateur Russell Ybarra, wrote in an email, referring to the Tennessee children's hospital, which stood to reap the proceeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in an interview Thursday, had said he was considering terminating the auction, after The New York Times raised questions about it. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization and Charitybuzz did not immediately respond Friday to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama family has not directly participated in any fund-raising solicitation efforts since President Obama took office to avoid the impression that donations would allow the donor to get special access, said Norm Eisen, a former White House ethics lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An infrastructure plan Democrats can love?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect's son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, told New York business leaders on Friday that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vision for a large-scale federal infrastructure program was &quot;closer&quot; to Senator Chuck Schumer's, the incoming minority leader, than to the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kushner made the remarks at an event hosted by the Partnership for New York City, just after an appearance by Mr. Schumer, the New York senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week at a news conference in Washington, Mr. McConnell said he was not interested in &quot;trillion-dollar stimulus&quot; to finance any infrastructure plan, setting up what could be the first of many clashes with a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White House that will not always hew to Republican orthodoxy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign floated a $1 trillion infrastructure plan that would depend on private investors raising money and building the projects with the aid of some form of tax credit. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief strategist, said shortly after the election that a huge infrastructure plan would be in the offing, but the form was not clear. Democrats have long said they want an infrastructure plan that has plentiful direct federal funding, something Mr. Schumer has said repeatedly, not tax credits for rich developers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This does not excite Mr. McConnell who, like most Republicans, recalls President Obama's early stimulus plan unfavorably. That plan came in the middle of the worst recession since the Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inherits an economy that is healthy enough that the Federal Reserve raised interest rates Wednesday to head off overheating. The Fed has made it clear that if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> insists on pumping money into the economy, it will hasten rate increases to stave off inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to do this carefully and correctly, and the issue of how to pay for it needs to be dealt with responsibly,&quot; Mr. McConnell, the Kentucky senator, said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And speaking of cross-party conciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate watchers used to the obstructionist stance that the Republican leader, Mr. McConnell, took with President Obama for eight years have been waiting for signs of the kind of minority leader that Mr. Schumer will be when he takes over as Democratic leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic senator sent a big flashing of conciliation on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Schumer praised Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> call with the president of Taiwan, which drew objections from both sides of the aisle, as a shrewd move that sent a signal to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of a change in direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Schumer made the remarks at the same annual meeting of the Partnership for New York City that Mr. Kushner spoke at, according to two people in attendance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those attendees interpreted the comments as aligning Mr. Schumer with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a diplomatic issue that has been met with consternation by the Obama White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Schumer described the call that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took roughly two weeks ago as shrewd, and not necessarily indicating that it was a reflection of his view of the &quot;One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; policy, the two attendees said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An aide to Mr. Schumer did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Schumer has been a critic of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a currency manipulator over the years. At the breakfast, where he was followed by Mr. Kushner, Mr. Schumer suggested that Democrats lost in part because the election was about a change in course, and Hillary Clinton ran as a continuation of the Obama administration's direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dismisses Russian hacking - again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect took to Twitter on Friday to again dismiss the significance of Russia's meddling in the election - but with a new twist. This time, he seemed to praise the revelations of one of the cyberattacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate? - Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (@realDonaldTrump) December 16, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The post seems to refer to an email stolen from the Democratic National Committee and given to WikiLeaks that came from a Democratic strategist, Donna Brazile, before a CNN Democratic primary debate in Flint, Mich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Brazile's subject line: &quot;One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint,&quot; Ms. Brazile wrote to John D. Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, and Jennifer Palmieri, the candidate's communications director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That might seem like a pretty obvious question, given that the debate was in Flint to address the crisis over the city's lead-contaminated water. But it cost Ms. Brazile her commentator's job at CNN, and it helped to fuel Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accusation during the campaign that the election was &quot;rigged&quot; in Hillary Clinton's favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many are excited, but more are worried as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency nears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new CBS News poll found that 46 percent of Americans are excited or optimistic about Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency, about the percentage who voted for him. But 53 percent say they are concerned or scared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the inauguration about a month away, a solid majority - 62 percent - say the president-elect will bring real change to the way Washington works. Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing probably depends on your party. Some 58 percent say they believe he will divide rather than unite people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jewish community confronts a divisive ambassador to Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement on Thursday that David M. Friedman, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bankruptcy lawyer, would be nominated to be the United States ambassador to Israel, is likely to roil an American Jewish community that sided overwhelmingly with Hillary Clinton and is already at sea in the wake of the 2016 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Friedman named US Ambassador to Israel, will maintain the special relationship between our two countries. https://t.co/yd4DqYInzw - Transition 2017 (@transition2017) December 16, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Divisions remain among Jewish people over President Obama's policies, especially his nuclear deal with Iran. And Mr. Friedman is not likely to unify the community. Confronting the liberal Jewish group J Street, which largely opposes the policies of Israel's conservative prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Friedman once leveled one of the worst insults possible to a Jew. He compared the group to kapos, the Jewish collaborators who enforced Nazi edict in the World War II concentration camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are J Street supporters really as bad as kapos? The answer, actually, is no. They are far worse than kapos - Jews who turned in their fellow Jews in the Nazi death camps,&quot; Mr. Friedman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">J Street reacted almost immediately to news of Mr. Friedman's nomination, calling on the Senate to reject him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As someone who has been a leading American friend of the settlement movement, who lacks any diplomatic or policy credentials and who has attacked liberal Jews who support two states as 'worse than kapos', Friedman should be beyond the pale for senators considering who should represent the United States in Israel,&quot; the group said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republican Jewish Coalition was all praise:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The selection of Mr. David Friedman to serve as United States ambassador to Israel sends a powerful signal to the Jewish community and the State of Israel that President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration will strengthen the bond between our two countries and advance the cause of peace within the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We look forward to working with David and the entire </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration to cripple Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons through new and strengthened sanctions, move the U.S. Embassy to the eternal capital of Israel, Jerusalem, and repair relations with our greatest ally in the Middle East that have eroded over the last eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't pay to jump the gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic adviser, Stephen Moore, caused quite a kerfuffle in Detroit on Thursday when in a fit of excitement, he announced that the economic commentator Larry Kudlow would be named chairman of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White House Council of Economic Advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kudlow, while certainly versed in economics, is not an economist. He has an undergraduate degree in history. The council chairman has traditionally been pulled from the highest echelons of academia to advise the president, not to lobby or persuade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, Mr. Kudlow is an ardent free trader and was openly critical of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> position on trade during the campaign, even as he enthusiastically backed the candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement would have also come as a surprise to Peter Navarro, a Harvard-trained professor of economics at the Paul Merage School of Business at the University of California, Irvine. Professor Navarro is widely considered the front-runner for the post, and his views on trade are more in line with the president-elect's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the Democrats sent out their reactions, and the news media came alive, Mr. Moore sheepishly admitted that, while he is pulling for his friend Mr. Kudlow, the deal is not done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Larry is the obvious choice, because he has all the connections with the key players on Capitol Hill, and there's nobody that can articulate the free-market, conservative economic message better than Larry can,&quot; he said. But he admitted he had jumped the gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UPDATE: @StephenMoore backtracks, says @Larry_Kudlow as chair of CEA &quot;isn't a done deal and I jumped the gun.&quot;https://t.co/zfmo4o4pi7 - Chad Livengood (@ChadLivengood) December 15, 2016</SPAN></P>
