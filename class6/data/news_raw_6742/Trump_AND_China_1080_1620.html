<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not a coincidence. In the waning hours of the Obama presidency, officials in Mexico bundled the drug kingpin Joaqu&iacute;n Guzm&aacute;n Loera, known as El Chapo, into an airplane and handed him to the American government so he could stand trial in New York.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His extradition came after years of painstaking diplomacy. It required convincing the government of Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto that the American justice system was better equipped to take Mr. Guzm&aacute;n, the leader of the violent Sinaloa cartel, out of the drug trade. This was no easy task: Washington's relationship with Mexico has been strained by an imbalance of power and by American slights. By completing the transfer on President Barack Obama's watch, Mexico appeared to be rewarding an administration that was respectful. It also ensured that the extradition was not seen as a concession to President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who made maligning Mexicans a centerpiece of his campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Obama officials succeeded because they tried to persuade, not hector, their Mexican counterparts. This fit with the administration's broader strategy for Latin America, one that was rooted in pragmatism and cooperation. It offers a lesson Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be foolish to disregard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Leaders in Latin America watched Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidential campaign with morbid fascination, followed the transition period with dread and are certain to have been stunned by his Inaugural Address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has called the United States' trade deficit with Mexico a scourge, he fails to acknowledge some truths. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect in 1994, trade with Canada and Mexico has soared, a boon for American companies and workers in several industries. Greater prosperity in Mexico caused unauthorized migration to the United States to drop sharply. A trade war would be likely to send Mexico's economy into a tailspin and encourage new migration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mexican officials have wisely refused to escalate tensions with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But if they conclude that a respectful and mutually beneficial relationship with the United States is impossible, they have cards to play that could stymie Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agenda. Mexico could cease rigorously controlling its border with Guatemala, which would lead more people to try to enter the United States. It could do more to encourage investment from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Russia, which are eager to strengthen ties with Latin America. And it could end robust cooperation on drug enforcement and intelligence, which would make Americans less secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mexico has made it abundantly clear that this is not the approach it wants to take. If the new administration builds on the successes of Mr. Obama, Mexico may never feel the need to do so.</SPAN></P>
