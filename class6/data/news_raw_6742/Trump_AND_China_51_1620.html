<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- Last month, as Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lead in the Republican presidential primaries widened and his feud with the party establishment intensified, Ding Qiushi, a chemist in Nanjing and founder of the online ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fan Club,'' sang his praises: ''A political outsider is taking the country by storm, with unflinching courage.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as in the United States, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a divisive figure. He has accused </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of erecting a ''Great Wall of protectionism,'' of ''stealing jobs from American workers'' and of ''currency manipulation.'' He has also said that Chinese should be issued fewer skilled-worker visas. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Portrayals of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Chinese state media are overwhelmingly negative. He has been branded a ''big mouth'' and ''lunatic.'' He has been showcased by Global Times and Xinhua as an example of the failures of American democracy. On social media, many Chinese take the same line and fire back at his criticisms of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has gained ground, his Chinese fans' ranks have swelled, and new fan microblogs have sprouted. In addition to the ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fan Club'' on Sina Weibo, these include ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Great Man from Heaven'' and ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Goes to the White House.'' Their followers have cheered the real estate billionaire, mocked Republican leaders and criticized the American news media as unfair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The reasons for Chinese interest in Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vary. There are those who endorse his positions, such as those who, mindful of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> own tense relations with some of its ethnic and religious minorities, voice support for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pledge to ban noncitizen Muslims from entering the United States. Some like his strongman politics, believing the world needs a stronger American president. Then there are those who root for him to win in the expectation that a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-led United States would antagonize other countries and hasten </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many simply find Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an intriguing exception to the usual sedate lineup of politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He speaks out of line, and that appeals to me,'' Lai Quanzhong, 47, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fan Club follower from Fujian Province, said in a telephone interview. He said that this was the first time he had paid close attention to an American election but that ''even for those who don't understand American elections, they just can't avoid listening to what he says.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His flamboyance is part of his attraction to Chinese who normally are indifferent to American politics, said Jin Canrong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University. ''That's why they pay attention to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who is quite entertaining,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also appeals to a practical streak in many Chinese, he said. ''He makes lots of money,'' Mr. Jin said. ''Chinese people like to be friends with pragmatists.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ding, the fan club founder, who has been posting news and videos about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since November, said, ''I admire his outspokenness and personal charisma.'' The fan club, he said, is a way to inform Chinese about a man who could become the next American president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The number of club followers has risen from about 2,000 in late February to nearly 9,000 at the end of March. They discuss the election, watch the debates and attack Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> detractors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Interviews with about a dozen fans suggest that some are well-educated professionals. Their views can seem contradictory: advocating personal liberty and free markets, but also nationalism and a strong state. They are interested in the American electoral process but say </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not ready for popularly elected leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some have been following Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since ''The Apprentice,'' the reality television show that he hosted. In fact, Sun Jianguo, 31, a building technician, said in an interview that it was Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who got him interested in American politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sun also likes Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> critical comments about Muslims. He said there are Muslims in his home province of Hebei and the city of Tianjin, where he went to college, ''and they can be bossy sometimes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tan Zhenxing, 29, another fan club follower, said in an interview that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could be the strong leader the United States needs to remain at the forefront of innovation. ''If America fails,'' Mr. Tan said, ''Europe will fail, and then </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will fail.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Chinese state media has faulted Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for his statements on immigrants. But many of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> middle-class Chinese fans do not see his proposals to expel illegal immigrants and bar low-skilled workers from entering the United States as applying to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A fan named ''GOPChina'' wrote: ''One principle that defines America is that America welcomes immigrants who work hard and are determined to get rich.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has denounced Chinese trade policies and promised to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports. Some Chinese commenters doubted such a tariff would actually materialize. Others say a President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would prod </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to rely less on manufacturing and exports. Kang Yuekui, 35, said: ''It would be good for the Chinese economy in the long run, and short-term pain is better than long-term suffering.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jiang Shuai, 27, a salesman from Shenzhen, argues that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would anger American businesses and make enemies in the Middle East and Europe and that in the process he would ''make </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> great again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One informal survey suggests it may be more Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> high profile than his specific views that has attracted a following in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Matthew Hartzell, an urban planner who moved back to the United States after six years in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, invited users of Zhihu, a Quora-like Chinese website, to cast a vote for American president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the first survey, which simply listed the candidates, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won with 38 percent of the 729 respondents' votes. But in the second survey, Mr. Hartzell included each candidate's opinions on issues like abortion, immigration and foreign policy. This time, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fell to 18 percent out of 474 respondents, well below Hillary Clinton's 46 percent.</SPAN></P>
