<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Doubts Swirl Around European Banks | Activists to Get Seats on A.I.G. Board <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FEARS OVER CENTRAL BANK MOVES  |  The decision by the Swedish central bank to lower its short-term rate to minus 0.50 percent from minus 0.35 percent has heightened fears that the brazen action by central banks is making things worse for the global economy,<BR>Landon Thomas Jr. writes in DealBook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markets generally embrace conviction and run away from uncertainty, but after the decision by the central bank, the Riksbank, stock markets sank, the price of oil plunged and investors fled for haven assets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The selloff continued in Asia on Friday. Japanese stocks sank to their lowest level in more than a year, Jonathan Soble reports in The New York Times. In South Korea, trading on the technology-heavy Kosdaq Index was suspended for 20 minutes after the benchmark fell by as much as 8.2 percent, The Wall Street Journal reports. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To investors, the rate cut smacked of desperation and it indicated that global central bankers are moving toward a round of competitive devaluations, or currency wars, to stimulate their economies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some suspect that efforts to keep currencies weak and exports strong could be counterproductive since someone still needs to buy all those goods. Negative interests also cut into bank profits and make savers more fearful and less likely to spend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of which can lead to a global recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Reserve is still maintaining that it expects the domestic economy to keep chugging along, but investors, still fearful of a global downturn, are betting that it will not move before 2017, as Binyamin Appelbaum reports in The New York Times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will meet in March, and our committee will carefully deliberate about what impact these developments have had,&quot; Janet L. Yellen told Congress on Thursday. &quot;Today I think it's premature to render a judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Yellen also emphasized that she did not foresee a need for negative rates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DOUBTS SWIRL AROUND EUROPEAN BANKS  |  It's not just central bankers feeling the heat from financial markets. Investors are questioning whether Deutsche Bank waited too long to mend itself and its shares have plunged nearly 40 percent so far this year, </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Eavis and Jack Ewing report in DealBook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deutsche, Germany's largest bank, is now worth about a third of its liquidation value. This suggests that investors have little faith in the ability of John Cryan, the co-chief executive, to squeeze solid earnings from its business.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors in credit markets have even begun to bet that some of Deutsche Bank's bonds will not be repaid in full. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doubts are swirling around many of Europe's largest banks, which were slower than their United States counterparts to bolster their balance sheets after the financial crisis. European banks with large trading operations, like Credit Suisse and Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, have come into investors' crosshairs this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares in JPMorgan have also fallen sharply, but its chairman and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, may be hoping that he can shore up confidence by buying stock himself.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dimon spent $26 million of his personal fortune buying 500,000 shares, Liz Moyer reports in DealBook. The move also recognizes that the shares have become relatively cheap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ON THE AGENDA  |  Data on January retail sales will be published at 8:30 a.m. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will hold a news briefing on trends in household borrowing and indebtedness at 10:00 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACTIVISTS TO GET SEATS ON A.I.G. BOARD  |  American International Group has not given Carl C. Icahn and John Paulson the breakup that they have pushed for, but it has given them seats at the table,<BR>Liz Moyer reports in DealBook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will gain two seats on the A.I.G. board, although Mr. Icahn said that he would appoint an associate of his investment firm because he is occupied with several other companies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than end the debate, the move is likely to just move the battle into the boardroom. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A.I.G. said Mr. Icahn and Mr. Paulson had agreed not to carry out a proxy fight, but it also did not back down from the less radical strategic plan it announced last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They had lobbied to split up A.I.G. so that it could avoid the &quot;systemically important financial institution&quot; designation that brings extra regulatory scrutiny and costs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We continue to believe the smaller and simpler is better and look forward to working collaboratively with the board and management to help catalyze a turnaround,&quot; Mr. Icahn said in a news release on Thursday.  </SPAN></P>
