</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Major victory for pipeline protesters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota are celebrating the Department of the Army's decision to block the building of an oil pipeline close to their reservation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move could lead to a lengthy environmental review that would halt the project'sconstruction for months or years. Some protesters camped near the site are vowing to stay.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our latest 360 video takes you inside a drum circle after news about the pipeline was received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> picked the retired surgeon Ben Carson as housing secretary today. Mr. Carson had previously said that he did not want a cabinet post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is also expanding his search for a secretary of state nominee and plans to interview more candidates this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They include John R. Bolton, a former U.N. ambassador; Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former Utah governor; Rex W. Tillerson, the president and chief executive of Exxon Mobil; and Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's next top diplomat may have to contend with the effects of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protocol-breaking call with the president of Taiwan, which could inflame tensions with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Death toll climbs in Oakland, Calif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 36 people were killed in a warehouse fire during a concert. Firefighters continue to look for victims in the building, known asthe Ghost Ship, where roughly 25 artists lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A criminal investigation is underway, but the cause of the fire has not been determined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Key votes in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, said he would resign after voters rejected constitutional changes he backed, intensifying the populist wave hitting the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Austrian voters, though, defied the wave by selecting Alexander Van der Bellen, a former Green Party leader, as president over a leader of the far-right Freedom Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historic first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will become the first sitting Japanese leader to visit Pearl Harbor, he announced today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Abe said he would travel to the American naval base with President Obama during a trip to Hawaii on Dec. 26 and 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Big banks, including Credit Suisse, have provided at least $43 billion in loans and financing to companies linked to deforestation in Southeast Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> internet filters block many of Silicon Valley's blockbuster products, an obsession with the culture of the American technology hub persists in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emissaries from the Chinese tech industry are visiting the Bay Area to see how ideas emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Empathy is a favorite buzzword for companies, but it shouldn't be confused with sympathy, our writer warns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days, she writes, empathy seems meant &quot;to manipulate political, technological and consumerist outcomes in our own favor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. stocks were up on Friday. Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A man fired a rifle inside Comet Ping Pong, a Washington pizzeria that had faced harassment over fake articles tying it to child abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect said he wanted to &quot;self-investigate&quot; the claims, the police said. No one was hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fidel Castro's ashes were interred in Santiago de Cuba, where he began his socialist revolution, after nine days of mourning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man so large in a box so small - it really impacts you,&quot; a 71-year-old retiree said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New Zealand's prime minister, John Key, stunned his nation by resigning. He said the job had taken a toll on his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In memoriam: Sammy Lee, the first Asian-American male athlete to win an Olympic gold medal, has died at 96. He was also a doctor who used his fame to fight housing discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Moana,&quot; the animated Disney musical, was again No. 1 at the North American box office. The movie has taken in $119.9 million in two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> History at the opera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time since 1903, the Met is performing an opera composed by a woman: Kaija Saariaho's &quot;L'Amour de Loin.&quot; Click here to see highlights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've compiled a playlist of works by female composers who have often been overlooked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sports roundup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alabama (13-0) will play Washington (12-1), and Clemson (12-1) will face Ohio State (11-1) in the College Football Playoff. The semifinals are Dec. 31, and the title game is Jan. 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tiger Woods finished near the end of the pack in his first tournament after a 466-day absence. &quot;His good shots were very good and his misses horrid,&quot; our reporter says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pumping iron after 60.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regaining muscle later in life is possible, but the process is different, a biologist says. His studies yield some good news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men and women in their 60s and 70s who trained with weights developed muscles as large and as strong as those of an average 40-year-old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recipe of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're up for a small challenge, try Manchurian cauliflower. It involves frying and a surprising ingredient: ketchup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision by the American air-conditioner maker Carrier to keep some jobs from being relocated to Mexico comes as its industry faces scrutiny over pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent global accord will curb hydrofluorocarbons, a chemical common in most air-conditioners that contributes to global warming. So the race is on to find greener alternatives as demand for air-conditioning rises around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Santa Clara University in California, heating and cooling systems are fueled by rooftop solar panels. And hydrofluoroolefins, an HFC substitute that is more energy efficient, are becoming popular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These technologies probably weren't on the mind of the American engineer Willis Carrier, who paved the way for modern air-conditioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1902, with cold water and an ammonia compressor, he figured out a way to control air temperature and the moisture in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of air-conditioning's next steps might be a return to the more distant past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In parts of the Middle East, the medieval wind tower is making a comeback. A physics professor has designed a smaller version of the structure, which pulls fresh air into buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've taken a traditional technology,&quot; the professor explains, &quot;and dragged it into the 21st century.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giovanni Russonello contributed reporting.</SPAN></P>
