<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a ''currency manipulator,'' threatened to impose stiff tariffs on Chinese imports and accused the country of inventing the idea of climate change to hurt American businesses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in his first telephone conversation with President Xi Jinping of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, now the president-elect, appeared to set aside those critiques expressed on the campaign trail, vowing that the two nations would have ''one of the strongest relationships,'' according to a statement released by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition office, Reuters reported. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Xi, in turn, told Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that ''facts have shown that cooperation is the only correct choice'' for the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, according to Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the phone call, which took place on Monday Beijing time, the two men agreed to maintain close communications and to meet at an early date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite the optimistic tone, analysts believe the relationship between Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mr. Xi could grow tense if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> follows through on his campaign promises, including a vow to impose a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports. Already, foreign policy experts in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appear to be nervous about the prospect of a trade war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An editorial on Sunday in Global Times, a Chinese newspaper known for its nationalistic views, said that trade would be ''paralyzed'' if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> imposed such a tariff. The article threatened a ''tit-for-tat'' response, saying that sales of American cars, airplanes, iPhones and soybeans would suffer and that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could limit the number of students who go to the United States to study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Making things difficult for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> politically will do him no good,'' the editorial said. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as a shrewd businessman, will not be so na&iuml;ve.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a longtime critic of American trade policies with Asian countries, and his pledge to rethink security commitments in Japan and South Korea has created uncertainty in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as a rising superpower, sees both benefits and potential dangers in Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leadership. Some analysts believe his focus on domestic issues might allow </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to exert more influence in Asia and the Pacific. Others worry that he may abandon international agreements, such as a landmark accord on climate change reached last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Li Yonghui, dean of the School of International Relations and Diplomacy at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said in an interview that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> emphasis on domestic affairs might help ease tensions between the two countries. But he added that Chinese leaders needed to prepare for the possibility that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might increase pressure on Beijing, for example, by imposing more restrictions on trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's very different from the Obama administration when it comes to issues like trade and economics,'' Mr. Li said. ''There's still a lot of uncertainty.''</SPAN></P>
