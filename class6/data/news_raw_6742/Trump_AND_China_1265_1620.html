<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Germany arrested an employee of its domestic intelligence agency. The man is accused of posting Islamist messages online and sharing secrets. [Reuters]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Five Star Movement, the Italian party campaigning against changes to the country's Constitution in a referendum on Sunday, has been tied to online outlets that spread conspiracy theories. [BuzzFeed]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Islamic State claimed the attack on Monday at Ohio State University, calling the Somali-born American student, seen here in a recent photo, who ran over people with a car and knifed others &quot;a soldier.&quot; [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> overtook Russia in space launches this year. [Moscow Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leave or be driven out: Residents of coastal villages in Alaska are grappling with difficult decisions on how and when to relocate in the face of flooding and erosion linked to climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state is warming twice as fast as the rest of the United States, pushing it to the forefront of adaptation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Die Antwoord, the confrontational South African rave-rap musicians, have become something entirely unexpected: Hollywood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Germany, the land of beer, riesling and schnapps, has gone gin mad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Times first prepared a report on the death of Fidel Castro in 1959. It has since cost us more hours than any other obituary we've ever run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And at a moment when technology has made cultivating relationships easier, but also shallower, one writer considers the importance of true friendships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We told you last week about Lee Duck-hee, a deaf South Korean tennis player who is ranked 143rd in the world, a notable achievement in the sport's professional era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a keen reader informed us that more than 100 years ago, a British player who lost her hearing was also a champion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlotte Cooper Sterry was a rising star at a time when female players wore dresses and used wooden rackets. Her style of attacking the net and serving overhand were rare then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year after winning her first Wimbledon title in 1895, she went completely deaf - why is not clear. But Ms. Sterry won the tournament (it was for amateurs only back then) four more times as well as an Olympic gold medal in 1900.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Sterry played into her 40s and died in 1966 at age 96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her achievements were soon eclipsed in history by players like Helen Wills Moody of the United States, who also won many Wimbledon titles, including four consecutively from 1927 to 1930.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that stretch, she lost just one set at the tournament: in 1927 to Ms. Sterry's daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Who is this Miss Sterry?&quot; a Times article reported stunned spectators asking. An agitated man revealed the older Ms. Sterry's feats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, &quot;Look up your records, you ignorant scriveners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
