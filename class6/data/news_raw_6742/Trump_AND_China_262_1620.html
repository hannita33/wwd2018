<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who has offered only a jumble of contradictory ideas, will have a hard time dealing with urgent challenges abroad.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is having trouble choosing a secretary of state underscores concerns about his ability to manage the international challenges he will face in office - from the aggression of leaders like Russia's Vladimir Putin to the Islamic State to strains among NATO allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign talk suggested new approaches; at other times, he offered a jumble of contradictory ideas. His mantra of &quot;America first&quot; implies a reduced American role overseas, but he has also advocated a tough posture toward adversaries. All of this creates an unsettling unpredictability that has already affected how governments and companies think and act. There is still little sign that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has declined daily briefings by the intelligence agencies, understands these threats and how to deal with them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Korea: An early test may be North Korea, which could soon have enough nuclear fuel for 20 bombs and could deploy warheads on missiles capable of hitting South Korea, Japan and American assets in the Pacific. Experts say the North's production of more and better bombs has increased the chance of a military confrontation. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has threatened to slap tariffs on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> exports, in part to force Beijing to exert more pressure on Pyongyang. As the North's main supplier, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is vital to resolving the nuclear issue. But raising tariffs on the Chinese would risk a trade war and make cooperation less likely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Islamic State and Syria: American forces are engaged in major battles to liberate Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria from the Islamic State and are fighting extremists elsewhere, including Mali. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has said, &quot;I know more about ISIS than the generals,&quot; has not offered any plan beyond &quot;I would bomb the [expletive] out of 'em.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Syria, he has talked of abandoning American support for rebels trying to oust President Bashar al-Assad and joining the alliance between Mr. Assad and Russia, Mr. Assad's partner in bombing Syrian civilians. After 500,000 deaths, there's no end to the five-year civil war, which has created chaos, allowing ISIS to thrive and claim large parts of Syrian territory. A united effort to fight ISIS would require a peace deal between Mr. Assad and the opposition forces. But Secretary of State John Kerry has not been able to get Russia to push Mr. Assad in that direction. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seems confident he can work with Mr. Putin, but it's unclear that Russia would accept any deal unless Mr. Assad is allowed to remain in power indefinitely, which the Syrians he has brutalized are unlikely to accept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iran: Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has vowed to tear up the 2015 deal under which Iran halted its most dangerous nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of most international sanctions. The agreement is working, as many of its critics in Congress and the Middle East acknowledge. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, however, has chosen a national security adviser and a C.I.A. director who are both adamantly opposed to the deal, regardless of the consequences of ending it. If it is jettisoned, Iran would almost certainly resume its nuclear program. America's partners in the agreement - Britain, France, Germany, Russia and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - will not reimpose sanctions as part of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> quixotic quest for some &quot;better deal,&quot; and American businesses will be further disadvantaged in the competition for Iranian markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the kind of self-made crisis a new president cannot afford. Iranian moderates open to engagement with the West are battling for power against anti-Western hard-liners. The hard-liners hope to exploit Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hostility to ensure that President Hassan Rouhani, who negotiated the nuclear deal, is defeated for re-election next year. It should matter to America which side prevails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nuclear Proliferation: Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will soon command America's nuclear arsenal. In the campaign, he spoke casually about possibly retaliating against the Islamic State with a nuclear weapon and about Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia possibly developing their own nuclear arsenals instead of relying on defense alliances with the United States. Since World War II, the United States has sought to prevent nuclear war and the expansion of nuclear arsenals. It would be catastrophic if a nuclear weapon is used during Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency or if his stance encouraged more countries to acquire such arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global Order: Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> questioning of the value of NATO, other alliances and America's role in the world has shaken the core institutions that kept the peace in Europe and elsewhere for decades. But he has offered no coherent analysis of what is wrong with these alliances or what should replace them. His fondness for strongmen like Mr. Putin and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, whom he called &quot;a fantastic guy,&quot; suggests indifference if not disdain for efforts to promote human rights and democracy. He has displayed no concern for Russian expansionism in Ukraine. His plan to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership suggests a willingness to allow </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to expand its influence in Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidents have wide latitude to act unilaterally in foreign policy and command a powerful bully pulpit. Even so, Congress, career diplomats, interest groups, the media and foreign leaders can help shape, inform and stymie presidential intentions. The world has long relied on the United States to be the steady hand. The challenges will be more complex than Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ever imagined. There is little reason to believe that he will provide strong leadership on these fronts, but every reason to hope that he does.</SPAN></P>
