</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">609 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three words that were unthinkable to tens of millions of Americans -- and much of the rest of the world -- have now become the future of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having confounded Republican elites in the primaries, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did the same to the Democrats in the general election, repeating the judo move of turning the weight of a complacent establishment against it. His victory is a humbling blow to the news media, the pollsters and the Clinton-dominated Democratic leadership. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The candidates appeared neck-in-neck in the popular vote, but Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bested Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So who is the man who will be the 45th president?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After a year and a half of erratic tweets and rambling speeches, we can't be certain. We don't know how Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would carry out basic functions of the executive. We don't know what financial conflicts he might have, since he never released his tax returns, breaking with 40 years of tradition in both parties. We don't know if he has the capacity to focus on any issue and arrive at a rational conclusion. We don't know if he has any idea what it means to control the largest nuclear arsenal in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here is what we do know: We know Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the most unprepared president-elect in modern history. We know that by words and actions, he has shown himself to be temperamentally unfit to lead a diverse nation of 320 million people. We know he has threatened to prosecute and jail his political opponents, and he has said he would curtail the freedom of the press. We know he lies without compunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has said he intends to cut taxes for the wealthy and to withdraw the health care protection of the Affordable Care Act from tens of millions of Americans. He has insulted women and threatened Muslims and immigrants, and he has recruited as his allies a dark combination of racists, white supremacists and anti-Semites. Given the importance of the alt-right to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rise, it is perhaps time to drop the ''alt.'' David Duke celebrated Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory on Tuesday night, tweeting, ''It's time to TAKE AMERICA BACK!!!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has looked beyond our borders, he has said that he would tear up the agreement to prevent Iran from building nuclear arms and that he would do away with the North American Free Trade Agreement. He has said that he would repudiate last December's Paris agreement on climate change, thereby abandoning America's leadership role in addressing the biggest long-term threat to humanity. He has also threatened to abandon NATO allies and start a trade war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We know that, with Republicans controlling both houses of Congress, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be able to restore a right-wing majority by filling the Supreme Court seat that Republican senators have held hostage for nine months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Republicans will soon control every branch of the federal government, in addition to a majority of governorships and statehouses. There is no obvious check on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vengeful impulses. Other Republican leaders, including his running mate, Mike Pence, have largely made excuses for his most extreme behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By challenging every norm of American politics, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> upended first the Republican Party and now the Democratic Party, which attempted a Clinton restoration at a moment when the nation was impatient to escape the status quo. Misogyny and racism played their part in his rise, but so did a fierce and even heedless desire for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That change has now placed the United States on a precipice.</SPAN></P>
