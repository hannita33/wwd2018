<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke by telephone with Taiwan's president on Friday, a striking break with nearly four decades of diplomatic practice that could precipitate a major rift with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> even before Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> takes office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> office said he had spoken with the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, ''who offered her congratulations.'' He is believed to be the first president or president-elect who has spoken to a Taiwanese leader since at least 1979, when the United States severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan as part of its recognition of the People's Republic of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the statement, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> office said the two leaders had noted ''the close economic, political, and security ties'' between Taiwan and the United States. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it said, ''also congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> motives in taking the call, which lasted more than 10 minutes, were not clear. In a Twitter message late Friday, he said Ms. Tsai ''CALLED ME.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But diplomats with ties to Taiwan said it was highly unlikely that the Taiwanese leader would have made the call without arranging it in advance. Ms. Tsai's office  confirmed that it had taken place, saying the two had discussed promoting economic development and ''strengthening defense.'' Taiwan's Central News Agency hailed the call as ''historic.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Saturday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign minister, Wang Yi, in his government's first official reaction, played down the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stressing the good relationship between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he said, ''I also believe this will not change the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy upheld by the American government for many years.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Wang, speaking to reporters in Beijing, characterized the call as initiated by the Taiwanese government. ''We believe it's a petty action by the Taiwan side.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president-elect has shown little heed for the nuances of international diplomacy, holding a series of unscripted phone calls to foreign leaders that have roiled sensitive relationships with Britain, India and Pakistan. On Thursday, the White House urged Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to use experts from the State Department to prepare him for these exchanges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The White House was not told about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> call until after it happened, according to a senior administration official. But afterward, the Chinese government contacted the White House to discuss the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The longer-term fallout from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Tsai conversation could be significant, the administration official said, noting that the Chinese government issued a bitter protest after the United States sold weapons to Taiwan as part of a well-established arms agreement grudgingly accepted by Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> call with President Tsai is a bigger provocation. Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway province and has adamantly opposed the attempts of any country to carry on official relations with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Nov. 14, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke with Xi Jinping, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, and a statement from the transition team said the two men had a ''clear sense of mutual respect.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Initial reaction from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> about Friday's telephone call was surprise verging on disbelief. ''This is a big event, the first challenge the president-elect has made to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. ''This must be bad news for the Chinese leadership.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Official state-run media have portrayed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a positive light, casting him as a businessman </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could get along with. He was favored among Chinese commentators during the election over Hillary Clinton, who was perceived as being too hard on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> exchange touched ''the most sensitive spot'' for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign policy, Mr. Shi said. The government, he said, would most likely interpret it as encouraging Ms. Tsai, the leader of the party that favors independence from the mainland, to continue to resist pressure from Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among diplomats in the United States, there was similar shock. ''This is a change of historic proportions,'' said Evan S. Medeiros, a former senior director of Asian affairs in the Obama administration. ''The real question is, what are the Chinese going to do?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a second Twitter message about the call Friday night, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, ''Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ties between the United States and Taiwan are currently managed through quasi-official institutions. The American Institute in Taiwan issues visas and provides other basic consular services, and Taiwan has an equivalent institution with offices in several cities in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These arrangements are the outgrowth of the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy that has governed relations between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since President Richard M. Nixon's historic meeting with Mao Zedong in Beijing in 1972. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter formally recognized Beijing as the sole government of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, abrogating its ties with Taipei a year later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The call also raised questions of conflicts of interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Newspapers in Taiwan reported last month that a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization representative had visited the country, expressing interest in perhaps developing a hotel project adjacent to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, which is undergoing a major expansion. The mayor of Taoyuan, Cheng Wen-tsan, was quoted as confirming that visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokeswoman for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization, Amanda Miller, said that the company had ''no plans for expansion into Taiwan,'' and that there had been no ''authorized visits'' to the country to push a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> development project. But Ms. Miller did not dispute that Anne-Marie Donoghue, a sales manager overseeing Asia for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels, had visited Taiwan in October, a trip that Ms. Donoghue recorded on her Facebook page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Donoghue did not respond to requests for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> call with the Taiwanese president came just as President Obama delivered a more subtle, but also aggressive, rebuff of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: He blocked, by executive order, an effort by Chinese investors to buy a semiconductor production firm called Aixtron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama took the action on national security grounds, after an intelligence review concluded that the technology could be used for ''military applications'' and help provide an ''overall technical body of knowledge and experience'' to the Chinese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The decision is likely to accelerate tension with Beijing, as Chinese authorities make it extraordinarily difficult for American technology companies, including Google and Facebook, to gain access to the Chinese market, and Washington seeks to slow </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> acquisition of critical technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has made little effort to avoid antagonizing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He has characterized climate change as a ''Chinese hoax,'' designed to undermine the American economy. He has said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> manipulation of its currency deepened a trade deficit with the United States. And he has threatened to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods, a proposal that critics said would set off a trade war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By happenstance, just hours before Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> conversation with Ms. Tsai, Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state who designed the ''One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' policy, was in Beijing meeting with Mr. Xi. It was unclear if Mr. Kissinger, 93, was carrying any message from Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with whom he met again recently in his role as the Republican Party's foreign policy sage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The presidential election has taken place in the United States and we are now in the key moment. We, on the Chinese side, are watching the situation very closely. Now it is in the transition period,'' Mr. Xi told Mr. Kissinger in front of reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A small, hard-line faction of Republicans has periodically urged a more confrontational approach to Beijing, and many of President George W. Bush's advisers were pressing such an approach in the first months of his presidency in 2001. But the attacks of Sept. 11 defused that move, and Iraq became the No. 1 enemy. After that, Mr. Bush needed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- for North Korea diplomacy, counterterrorism and as an economic partner -- and any movement toward confrontation was quashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For his part, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has shown little concern about ruffling feathers in his exchanges with leaders. He also spoke on Friday with the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, who has called Mr. Obama a ''son of a whore'' and been accused of ordering the extrajudicial killings of thousands of suspected drug dealers. On Saturday, Mr. Duterte said that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had wished him well in his antidrug campaign, though his account could not immediately be verified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This week, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeared to accept an invitation from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to visit Pakistan, a country that Mr. Obama has steered clear of, largely over tensions between Washington and Islamabad over counterterrorism policy and nuclear proliferation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lawmakers expressed alarm at the implications of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> freewheeling approach.''What has happened in the last 48 hours is not a shift. These are major pivots in foreign policy w/out any plan. That's how wars start,'' Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote on Twitter. ''It's probably time we get a Secretary of State nominee on board. Preferably w experience. Like, really really soon.''</SPAN></P>
