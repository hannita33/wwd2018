</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is taking calls from world leaders at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in Manhattan, and he is to meet there today with Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York City police and the Secret Service are meeting on how to handle Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> security, which has clogged traffic on Fifth Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">denied reports of chaos and infighting, insisting that his transition was &quot;going so smoothly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Obama and Chancellor Angela Merkel are holding bilateral meetings in Berlin today and will be joined Friday by the leaders of Britain, France, Italy and Spain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His final international trip as president, which concludes this weekend in Peru, has been focused on offering reassurances of a peaceful, if challenging, transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you may have noticed, the next American president and I could not be more different,&quot; he said in Athens on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scale of the disruption Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may bring to American foreign policy became abruptly clear when Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, embraced him as &quot;a natural ally&quot; against &quot;the terrorists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Assad uses the term to include Islamic militants of various stripes but also domestic insurgents fighting his authoritarian government in a bloody civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Vladimir V. Putin instructed Russia to withdraw from the International Criminal Court, calling it &quot;ineffective and one-sided.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blow to the young court was largely symbolic, because Russia, like the United States, has not ratified the treaty that created the court and is not under its jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Walmart workers in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, furious over low pay and exhausting schedules, have organized strikes and boycotts at some of retail giant's 400 stores across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beijing has so far looked the other way, caught between its Marxist commitment to the working class and the risk of encouraging labor activism independent of the Communist Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JPMorgan Chase has struck a $264 million settlement with the U.S. authorities over its hiring practices in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, people briefed on the matter told The New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank was found to have hired children of Chinese leaders in exchange for lucrative assignments from government-run companies, as we previously reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JPMorgan denied charges of bribery, arguing that the hiring of well-connected employees was routine in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The BBC World Service is adding 11 new language services, most of which will cover Africa and the Indian subcontinent. A Korean service will also begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director general called it the &quot;biggest expansion of the World Service since the 1940s,&quot; forecasting an audience of 500 million people by 2022.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Janet Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, will testify before Congress. Her remarks may signal whether the central bank intends to raise interest rates next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the name </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appears on products ranging from cosmetics to luxury toilets - in most cases without any O.K. from the president-elect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A couple jailed in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for nearly two years filed suit in the United States against GlaxoSmithKline, accusing the pharmaceutical giant of causing their arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case, in which they say the company asked them to investigate a troublemaker who was actually a whistle-blower, forced multinationals to curtail some of their freewheeling ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, may go public byMarch, aiming for a $30 billion valuation that would make it the third-most-valuable tech company at market debut, after Alibaba and Facebook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Labatt, one of Canada's biggest breweries, will end a longstanding policy that awarded the company's retirees with free beer for life.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you haven't read our recent story on the Virginia Quintuple Anvil Triathlon, check it out. It chronicles a race from hell: 700 miles of swimming, biking and running in five days. Participants cry, hallucinate, and do some other things we won't say because it might ruin your breakfast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And for what?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you have to ask,&quot; some racers say, &quot;you will never know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Endurance races are growing in popularity as many athletes seek a challenge beyond the quaint, 26.2-mile traditional marathon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's the Badwater Ultramarathon in California. It's 135 miles, starts in Death Valley and is held in July, when temperatures exceed triple digits. Some runners train in saunas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extreme weather is also a major factor in competitions in Chile's Patagonia region, Costa Rica's jungles and the Arctic Circle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One grueling athletic adventure is known for secrecy. The Barkley is a 100-mile Tennessee trail race that few finish. Hopefuls must complete an essay to gain entrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Self-Transcendence 3,100 Mile Race, though, may challenge the mind more than the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It takes place on one New York City block and over 52 days. Runners must average almost 60 miles a day to reach 3,100 - that's thousands of laps if you're wondering.</SPAN></P>
