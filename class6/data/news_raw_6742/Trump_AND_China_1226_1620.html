<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Swiss Investigate Apparent Suicide of Former Zurich Insurance Chief | Nuns With Guns: The Struggles Between Regulators and Bankers <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HOW FAR DOES CORPORATE LIABILITY EXTEND?  |  MetLife is being sued by people who lost their money through a Ponzi scheme and say that the insurer ignored or failed to notice signs that agents and brokers were peddling the financing program,<BR>Victoria Finkle reports in DealBook. The legal battle has raised questions about how far a company's liability should go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Diversified Lending Group crashed in 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Bruce Friedman, the man who ran it, accusing him of misappropriating millions of dollars in investor funds. He had operated a Ponzi scheme and defrauded hundreds of investors of more than $200 million, according to court documents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MetLife has settled some cases with its own customers who were duped by the D.L.G. offer, but the current batch of lawsuits involves people who did not buy MetLife insurance. These people put their money in a D.L.G. investment pitched to them by sales representatives, some of whom were affiliated with MetLife and some of whom were independent contractors approved to sell its products.  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MetLife has argued in court documents that it &quot;had no relationship with D.L.G.&quot; and &quot;did not sell, or materially assist in the sale&quot; of the D.L.G. program. In the case of Christine Ramirez, who invested $279,769  in the fund, MetLife also said it was not legally obligated to supervise the broker who made the sale to Ms. Ramirez because he was a contractor, licensed through an unaffiliated broker-dealer. The company added that it did not &quot;take or receive anything from&quot; Ms. Ramirez and is not liable for damages. Its spokesman said the company did not comment on continuing litigation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This case is about aiding and abetting,&quot; said Richard E. Donahoo, founder of Donahoo &amp; Associates, one of the lawyers representing Ms. Ramirez. &quot;Mr. Friedman, who was a felon, likely could never have obtained the millions from the hundreds of people that he cheated without the legitimacy that a company like MetLife provided.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court battle comes just as policy makers in Washington are considering whether large financial institutions are &quot;too big to manage.&quot; MetLife successfully fought off the government's labeling of it as a systemically important financial institution, but there are still concerns about whether big financial institutions are have sufficient control over their assets and employees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Too big to manage' is really the next frontier of regulatory challenges in the financial industry,&quot;   said Robert J. Jackson Jr., a professor of law at Columbia University. &quot;Even the best senior managers will tell you that running an organization of this size and scope well, and keeping an eye on all of his employees, is an enormous challenge that we're not yet prepared for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SWISS INVESTIGATE APPARENT SUICIDE OF FORMER ZURICH INSURANCE CHIEF  |  Martin Senn, the former chief executive of Zurich Insurance Group, has killed himself,<BR>David Jolly reports in The New York Times.  Details of the death were not made public by the company, beyond the confirmation that his family had said he killed himself on Friday. Swiss news outlets reported that Mr. Senn had died at his vacation home in Klosters, near Davos. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roman R&uuml;egg, a spokesman for the police of Graub&uuml;nden canton, which includes Klosters, said on Monday that police officers had confirmed Mr. Senn's death Friday evening. He refused to confirm or deny reports that Mr. Senn had shot himself as the investigation was continuing. He added that if there had been a suicide note, the police had not obtained it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Senn, 59, joined Zurich Insurance in 2006, becoming chief executive in 2010. He was credited with helping the company to navigate the financial crisis without major losses, but stepped down in December, citing &quot;setbacks&quot; that included failing to buy RSA Insurance Group of Britain and losses from insurance claims related to the chemical explosions in Tianjin, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in August. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, the company issued a statement, saying: &quot;With the passing of Martin, we lose not only a highly valued former C.E.O. and colleague, but also a close friend. Our thoughts are with his bereaved family and friends, to whom we extend our deepest sympathies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news of his death drew comparisons to the suicide less than three years ago of the company's chief financial officer, Pierre Wauthier. Mr. Wauthier killed himself, leaving a note in which he referred to tensions with Josef Ackermann, the company's demanding chairman. Mr. Ackermann stepped down soon after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequent investigations by Zurich Insurance and Switzerland's financial watchdog found that Mr. Wauthier had not been under undue pressure, although Mr. Wauthier's survivors dispute this.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NUNS WITH GUNS: THE STRUGGLES BETWEEN REGULATORS AND BANKERS   |  Lenders have bolstered their forces with people to interpret and enforce a wave of new regulations, bringing striking change to banks' internal cultures,<BR>The Wall Street Journal reports.  The 2010 Dodd-Frank law, intended to prevent another financial crisis, is one of the most complex pieces of legislation ever. It is the length of about 15 copies of &quot;War and Peace&quot; and covers matters like how much capital banks must set aside or how they can advertise. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks have hired tens of thousands of new employees and federal agencies have dispatched thousands of their own minders to watch over them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new regulatory environment has changed the way banks work and forced them to push back their offerings. It has also been costly. Spending on regulatory compliance by the six largest banks in the United States rose to $70.2 billion in 2013, from $34.7 billion in 2007.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The change can be maddening, with regulators, internal compliance executives and employees all operating like rival tribes, people who worked on the issues told The  Journal. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When bank compliance executives at Barclays shared images of how each group thinks of the others at a town hall, bankers were represented by cowboys on horses with guns. Compliance officials were depicted as nuns carrying guns. Barclays declined to comment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compliance employees told The Journal that they felt like hallway monitors, with people dropping what they were doing when they entered the room.<BR>One former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau deputy said he gave examiners pep talks, reminding them to &quot;never let it be personal&quot; and not to go in &quot;with a chip on your shoulders.&quot; </SPAN></P>
