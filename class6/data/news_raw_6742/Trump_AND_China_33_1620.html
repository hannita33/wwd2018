</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, defending his recent phone call with Taiwan's president, asserted in an interview broadcast on Sunday that the United States was not bound by the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy, the 44-year diplomatic understanding that underpins America's relationship with its biggest rival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, speaking on Fox News, said he understood the principle of a single </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that includes Taiwan, but declared, &quot;I don't know why we have to be bound by a One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy unless we make a deal with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> having to do with other things, including trade.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, look,&quot; he continued, &quot;we're being hurt very badly by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with devaluation; with taxing us heavy at the borders when we don't tax them; with building a massive fortress in the middle of the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, which they shouldn't be doing; and, frankly, with not helping us at all with North Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not the first incoming Republican president to question the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy, but his suggestion that it could be used as a chip to correct Chinese behavior sets him apart, several Asia experts said. While Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been praised by some Republicans for taking a new look at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy, his stance could risk a backlash by Beijing, the analysts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not since 1972, when President Richard M. Nixon and Mao Zedong enshrined the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> principle in the Shanghai Communiqu&eacute;, has an American president or president-elect so publicly and explicitly questioned the agreement, which resulted in the United States' ending its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan in 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Monday that the government had &quot;serious concern&quot; about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remarks, renewing a debate that erupted nine days ago when he took a congratulatory phone call from President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At first, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> played down the implications of the call, saying he was just being polite. Later, his aides said he was well aware of the diplomatic repercussions of speaking to Taiwan's leader. Lobbyists for Taiwan, including the law firm of former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, spent months laying the groundwork for the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, met with Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, whom Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has designated as his national security adviser, according to a person told about the meeting. It was not clear what the men had discussed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Republican foreign policy experts - including John R. Bolton, who is believed to be a front-runner for the post of deputy secretary of state - have praised Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for shaking up a decades-old diplomatic agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a candidate, Ronald Reagan criticized the decision to abrogate recognition of Taiwan; after his election, he invited a delegation from Taiwan to attend his inauguration, antagonizing Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1982, as president, Reagan pushed for the so-called Six Assurances, one of which was a reaffirmation that the United States did not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. Still, he abided by the terms of the 1979 joint communiqu&eacute; that established relations between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggestion that the policy could be wielded as a chip in a broader negotiation with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has implications not just for Washington's relationship with Beijing, several experts on Asia said, but also for America's support for Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By putting One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> up for grabs, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will suck all the oxygen out of the U.S.-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relationship, and it risks eventually trading away U.S. support for Taiwan for another U.S. interest,&quot; said Evan Medeiros, a former senior director for Asia at the National Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are good reasons why eight presidents since 1972 have relied on the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy,&quot; he added. &quot;This is one area where the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> team would do well to heed the lessons of history instead of bucking them in the uncertain hope of getting something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeffrey A. Bader, Mr. Medeiros's predecessor in the Obama administration, said the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy had &quot;always been seen as a foundation of the relationship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> apparently sees it as part of a broader set of new transactions,&quot; he said. &quot;Mixing trade with an issue seen by Beijing as involving sovereignty is likely to produce an angry Chinese backlash and worsen both issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An editorial on Monday in The Global Times, a Chinese state-run tabloid, said that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was &quot;like a child in his ignorance of foreign policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy cannot be bought and sold,&quot; the editorial said. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it seems, only understands business and believes that everything has a price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, however, did not appear worried about inflaming Beijing. He repeated in the Fox News interview many of the criticisms he has made about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, emphasizing what he said was its unwillingness to help curb the nuclear ambitions of its neighbor North Korea - an issue that foreign policy experts believe could confront Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the first geopolitical crisis of his presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect said he would not tolerate having the Chinese government dictate whether he could take a call from the president of Taiwan. He reiterated that he had not placed the call, and described it as &quot;a very short call saying, 'Congratulations, sir, on the victory.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese government, which once viewed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> favorably as an alternative to the hawkish Hillary Clinton, has struggled to respond to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unorthodox approach. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign minister, Wang Yi, initially played down the significance of the phone call, calling it a &quot;petty action by the Taiwan side&quot; that he said would not upset the longstanding policy of One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has repeated his campaign criticisms of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - and as his statements about Taiwan have rippled throughout the region - Beijing has noticeably hardened its tone. It warned him last week, in a front-page editorial in the overseas edition of People's Daily, that &quot;creating troubles for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-U.S. relationship is creating troubles for the U.S. itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a pointed rejoinder to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the editorial said that pushing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Taiwan &quot;would greatly reduce the chance to achieve the goal of making America great again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
