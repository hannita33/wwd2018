<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The billionaire investor Cliff Asness is a staunch libertarian who is very much against government intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except, perhaps, when the government intervention involves $35 million going to his firm, AQR Capital Management. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The funds from the Connecticut state government are part of efforts to persuade companies not to leave the state and includes loans and grants tied to conditions for jobs to be created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The state has been trying to stem the flow of business leaving after a tax increase last year, and the Connecticut State Bond Commission approved a similar offer to Bridgewater Associates, the world's biggest hedge fund, for $22 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some have wondered whether these packages actually create jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Case in point: Several months after Bridgewater received approval for its aid package, the company announced a ''renovation'' that would involve job cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kevin Lembo, the state comptroller, has also questioned the wisdom of aiding investment firms that often employ only graduates from top-tier universities when the state could be spending on companies that create more stable, middle-class jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Madoff Investors Keep Billions in Profit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The company led by the American billionaire Koch brothers, along with dozens of banks and fund managers, kept billions of dollars in profit from Bernard L. Madoff's Ponzi scheme in accounts offshore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And, it turns out, the funds can stay there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They had invested in the Madoff fund from offshore accounts, and a judge said that certain funds held abroad, worth an estimated $2 billion, could not be made available to victims of the Madoff scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The judge said foreign bankruptcy proceedings blocked the trustee from gaining access to the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Koch Industries began investing in the Madoff fund well before its collapse and pulled out $21.5 million in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The money went to a fund registered in the British Virgin Islands and then to a Koch entity in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They were not alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several European banks also had Madoff money offshore, according to court papers, including HSBC, UBS, Credit Suisse, an international arm of Merrill Lynch and the French money manager Natixis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Facebook's Censorship Tool</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You've probably read about the efforts by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, to learn Mandarin, his visits to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his cultivation of relationships with the country's leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Facebook has made deeper efforts to get into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The social network developed software to suppress posts from appearing in people's news feeds in specific geographic areas, according to three current and former Facebook employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Facebook has restricted content in countries like Pakistan and Russia before, but this new feature prevents content from appearing in feeds in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tool is one of many ideas the company has discussed and may never see the light of day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it illustrates the extent to which Facebook may be willing to compromise one of its core mission statements, ''to make the world more open and connected,'' if there is a possibility of gaining access to a market of 1.4 billion people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Quotation of the Day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It stinks... It's part and parcel of the unsavory marketing of his brands that he also did during the campaign.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  -- Norman Eisen, former chief White House ethics lawyer for President Obama, on Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> use of his properties as a backdrop for his transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Coming Up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The Commerce Department will report data on durable goods order in October. The manufacturing sector has been hurt by a strong dollar, but benefited slightly from a rebound in oil prices. Economists will be examining the numbers to see which of these trends prevails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Figures on new home sales last month will also be published. The market for new single-family homes is robust, so economists expect the sales to be about the same as September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The Federal Reserve publishes the minutes from its last meeting, which was before the presidential election. It is expected to reflect an increasing eagerness to raise interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In observance of the Thanksgiving holiday, there will be no DealBook newsletter on Thursday and Friday. We'll be back on Monday. For the latest in breaking news and analysis in the world of finance, please visit: dealbook.nytimes.com.</SPAN></P>
