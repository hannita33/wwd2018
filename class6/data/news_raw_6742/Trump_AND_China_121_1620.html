<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MONESSEN, Pa. -- Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vowed on Tuesday to rip up international trade deals and start an unrelenting offensive against Chinese economic practices, framing his contest with Hillary Clinton as a choice between hard-edge nationalism and the policies of ''a leadership class that worships globalism.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in western Pennsylvania, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sought to turn the page on weeks of campaign turmoil by returning to a core set of economic grievances that have animated his candidacy from the start. He threatened to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement and pledged to label </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a currency manipulator and impose punitive tariffs on Chinese goods. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He attacked Mrs. Clinton on her past support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact negotiated by the Obama administration, and challenged her to pledge that she would void the agreement in its entirety. Noting that Mrs. Clinton had backed free-trade agreements like Nafta in the past, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warned, ''She will betray you again.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a rally later in the day in eastern Ohio, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attacked the Trans-Pacific Partnership in more provocative terms, saying it was a ''rape of our country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a policy manifesto, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pennsylvania speech was an attack on the economic orthodoxy that has dominated the Republican Party since World War II. It is an article of faith among establishment Republicans and allied groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents the interests of large corporations, that trade is good and more trade is better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, by contrast, has made blistering attacks on trade his primary economic theme. In his address he rejected the standard view that countries benefit by importing goods, arguing that globalization helped ''the financial elite,'' while leaving ''millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is a critique that has been leveled for years, mainly by a small group of liberal economists who have gained little traction even on the Democratic side. On Tuesday, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not only embraced their views, but also cited the work of the liberal Economic Policy Institute by name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as president, would have significant authority to raise trade barriers, and his speech Tuesday included his most detailed account to date of his plans to do so, saying that he would pull the United States from Nafta if Mexico and Canada did not agree to renegotiate it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it is far from clear that any president has the power to reverse globalization. Under existing law, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could impose tariffs only on specific imports. The most likely effect would be to shift production to other low-cost nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> address opened his first swing-state tour of the general election race. After he muddled around the political map since his last Republican rivals withdrew, and veered away from the campaign last week for a trip to Scotland, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tour this week through Pennsylvania and Ohio was the start of a concerted effort to carve a path to 270 electoral votes on daunting political terrain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The language and location of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> speech encapsulated his aspirational strategy for the general election: His greatest source of support has been white working-class men, and his campaign hopes to compete in traditionally Democratic-leaning states, like Pennsylvania and Michigan, to offset his deep unpopularity with Hispanic voters and women, which may put swing states like Florida and Colorado out of reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> delivered his address at a steel plant in the heart of coal country, on a stage flanked by blocks of compressed steel wiring, aluminum cans and other metals. And for the second time in two weeks, he spoke carefully from a script. Aides to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has faced criticism throughout the race for factual exaggerations and outright falsehoods, circulated a copy of the speech with 128 footnotes documenting its claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could not resist the occasional ad-libbed line to skewer Mrs. Clinton or boast of his own achievements. He said, for example, that he had forced her to use the term ''radical Islamic terrorism.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And he took credit for pressuring Mrs. Clinton to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, though at the time she faced far greater pressure from a primary challenge on the left, from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> speech drew rebukes from two sides: The Clinton campaign attacked his credibility as a critic of free trade, and deployed Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a populist Democrat who is viewed as a potential running mate for Mrs. Clinton, to accuse Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of hypocrisy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''With all of his personal experience profiting from making products overseas, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the perfect expert to talk about outsourcing,'' Mr. Brown said, reciting a list of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> products, from suits to picture frames, that he said were made in other countries. ''We know just in my state alone where Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could have gone to make these things,'' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also drew a cold response from traditionally Republican-leaning interests for his heated attacks on international trade agreements. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which spends millions of dollars in federal elections, almost entirely in support of Republican candidates, criticized Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> speech on Twitter and claimed that his policies would hurt the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Even under best-case scenario, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tariffs would strip us of at least 3.5 million jobs,'' the group wrote in one Twitter message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has shifted and doubled back on high-profile policy pronouncements, trade has been a rare area of consistency in the 2016 race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At nearly every campaign rally, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has knocked trade deals with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as unfair to the American worker so frequently as to make his percussive pronunciation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a hallmark of impersonators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeared in his speech to pre-empt criticism from economists and business groups that have argued his policy proposals would lead to a damaging trade war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and perhaps other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We already have a trade war,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told the crowd, departing from his prepared remarks. ''And we're losing, badly.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has struggled for months to win support from the conservative business community, also attended a fund-raiser in West Virginia on Tuesday hosted by a coal executive, Robert E. Murray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It remains to be seen if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will stick closely to the trade-focused message he delivered in Pennsylvania. At an evening rally in eastern Ohio, he returned to a familiar set of red-meat themes, calling for a wall on the Mexican border and reiterating his vow to waterboard Islamic State terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But to win that state in November, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hopes to outflank Mrs. Clinton with economically distressed voters who may have voted Democratic in the past, and trade remains an issue that stirs up voters across party lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a nod to potential crossover voters, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at one point on Tuesday quoted Mr. Sanders by name in criticizing Mrs. Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though he dwelled at greatest length in Pennsylvania on what he described as the damaging economic consequences of globalization, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also laced his remarks with broader nationalist language, arguing that the United States would lose its sovereignty and national pride by negotiating too freely with the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They get the expansion. We get the joblessness,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said of trade deals with foreign countries. ''That's the way it works -- not going to happen anymore.''</SPAN></P>
