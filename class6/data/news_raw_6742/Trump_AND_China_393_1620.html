<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama is so disciplined that his wife has teased that he eats precisely seven lightly salted almonds each night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George W. Bush was an exercise buff, obsessed with staying trim by mountain biking and clearing brush at his ranch in Crawford, Tex. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is taking a different approach: A junk food aficionado, he is hoping to become the nation's fast food president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''A 'fish delight,' sometimes, right?'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told Anderson Cooper at a CNN town-hall-style meeting in February, extolling the virtues of McDonald's. ''The Big Macs are great. The Quarter Pounder. It's great stuff.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidential campaign is improvised, undisciplined, rushed and self-indulgent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And so is his diet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an era of gourmet dining and obsession with healthy ingredients, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a throwback to an earlier, more carefree time in American eating, when nobody bothered to ask whether the tomatoes were locally grown, and the first lady certainly didn't have a vegetable garden, complete with a bee hive, on the South Lawn of the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in Facebook, Instagram and Twitter posts, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has broadcast his culinary preferences to the nation -- devouring a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken (while reading The Wall Street Journal), feasting on a McDonald's burger and fries (to celebrate clinching the Republican presidential nomination) and chowing down on a taco bowl (in an effort to woo Hispanic voters).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Great afternoon in Ohio &amp; a great evening in Pennsylvania - departing now. See you tomorrow Virginia! pic.twitter.com/jQTQYBFpdb -- Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (@realDonaldTrump) August 2, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He is a lover of diner fare and fast food grub, of overcooked steaks (''It would rock on the plate, it was so well done,'' his longtime butler once observed) and the bland nourishment of Americana. He prefers burgers and meatloaf, Caesar salads and spaghetti, See's Candies and Diet Coke. And he shuns tea, coffee and alcohol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But his highbrow, lowbrow image -- of the jet-setting mogul who takes buckets of fried chicken onto his private plane with the gold-plated seatbelt buckles -- is also a carefully crafted one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If President George Bush revealed his patrician upbringing by requesting ''a splash'' more coffee at a truck stop in New Hampshire, and John Kerry helped reinforce his image as a New England blue blood by trying to order a cheese steak with Swiss in South Philadelphia, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> diet also telegraphs to his blue-collar base that he is one of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There's nothing more American and more of-the-people than fast food,'' said Russ Schriefer, a Republican strategist and ad maker. ''It is the peculiarity of the brand that he's able to be on his multimillion-dollar jet with the gold and black branding and colors, and at the same time eat KFC -- and what makes it perfect is he does it all with a knife and fork, while reading The Wall Street Journal.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Or, as Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser and pollster on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign, put it, ''It goes with his authenticity.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I don't think Hillary Clinton would be eating Popeye's biscuits and fried chicken,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last April, Mrs. Clinton did, indeed, visit a Chipotle near Toledo, Ohio, stopping into the chain restaurant unrecognized, in black sunglasses, and ordering a chicken burrito bowl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And President Bill Clinton was perhaps the nation's first fast food commander in chief, famous for ending his jogs at McDonald's. (Mr. Clinton now adheres to a largely vegan diet.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seems to come by his appetite for fast food genuinely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While junk food has long been a staple of campaign trail life -- Mitt Romney's 2012 press corps coined the term ''slunch'' to refer to the unhealthy phenomenon of the ''second lunch'' -- Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reliance on high-calorie fare is driven more by a combination of speed, efficiency and, above all else, cleanliness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though he often orders from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Grill when working out of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in Manhattan, he eats fast food several times a week while on the road because ''it's quick,'' as he told The Daily Mail last year while munching on Burger King on his Boeing 757-200.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has even suggested doing away with state dinners, in a fit of cost and time savings. ''We should be eating a hamburger on a conference table, and we should make better deals with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and others and forget the state dinners,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A man always prone to distraction and uninterested in small details, he has never approached food as anything other than a problem to be solved, quickly, as Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, an occasional dining partner, once told The Washington Examiner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the two men ate at Jean-Georges in Manhattan in 2002, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ordered briskly and imperiously from the head chef and owner, Mr. Christie recalled. ''Jean-Georges, remember the appetizer you made for me last week when I was here?'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asked the owner. ''We'll take two of those. And remember that main course you made, the special thing you made for me? We'll take two of those, too.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Christie watched with confusion and a bit of awe, he recalled in the interview. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> looked at him and said, ''Don't worry, you'll love it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who frets about germs and prizes cleanliness, also loves fast food because of its consistency and the promise, at least, of a basic level of hygiene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''One bad hamburger, you can destroy McDonald's. One bad hamburger, you take Wendy's and all these other places and they're out of business,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told Mr. Cooper of CNN. ''I'm a very clean person. I like cleanliness, and I think you're better off going there than maybe someplace that you have no idea where the food's coming from. It's a certain standard.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, he added, ''I think the food's good.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dining habits also bespeak a certain lack of creativity, and parochialism -- the kid from Queens who made it across the river to Manhattan's glistening skyline, but never cottoned to the city's haute cuisine. He once praised the ''imagination'' of his wife, Melania, in the kitchen -- before citing, as examples of her culinary derring-do, spaghetti and meat sauce, salads and meatloaf. (He still keeps a copy of his mother's meatloaf recipe.) Along with McDonald's, his favorite fast food joint, a family member said, is Jackson Hole Burgers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He is also a stickler for manners, attacking his primary race rival, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, for scarfing down meals during impromptu news conferences. ''I've never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion!'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told a crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who sometimes sips his Diet Coke through a straw, once caused Manhattan foodies to weep into their quinoa when he took Sarah Palin to a Famous Famiglia pizza restaurant in Times Square -- and then proceeded to cut his oversize slice with a plastic knife and fork.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has other pretensions, as well. Howie Carr, a Boston Herald columnist, recalled traveling on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plane and watching him rip the buns off his McDonald's patties before plying the burgers with ketchup. (''Do you know how many calories you save that way?'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asked Mr. Carr.) And Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also told US Weekly that he tries to save calories on pizza. (''I scrape the toppings off my pizza -- I never eat the dough,'' he said.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So pronounced are Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fast food preferences that Philip E. Beshara, a Washington-based lawyer, joked on Instagram that, as president, his cabinet would probably be staffed by Colonel Sanders, the Hamburglar and the Taco Bell Chihuahua.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And, of course, the Republican nominee's dining whims also keep his team on its toes, with staff members worrying not just about the backdrop for his speeches -- but also where to find the nearest drive-through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There's never any real planning for food,'' said one, between events on Friday. ''It's always just whatever he is craving, which is more often than not McDonald's.''</SPAN></P>
