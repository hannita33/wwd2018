</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Here's what you need to know to start your day.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Kerry, the departing U.S. secretary of state, dropped the diplomatic niceties and used one of his last speeches in office to rebuke Israel, warning that it was undermining any hope of a two-state solution to its conflict with the Palestinians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kerry spoke knowing that the incoming administration of President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may well abandon decades of American policy toward Israel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours earlier, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had posted on Twitter that the Obama administration had treated its ally in the Middle East with &quot;total disdain and disrespect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Debbie Reynolds, the Hollywood star best known for the 1952 musical &quot;Singin' in the Rain,&quot; died at 84, a day after the death of her daughter, the actress Carrie Fisher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's now with Carrie and we're all heartbroken,&quot; her son said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a look at six movies for which Ms. Reynolds will be remembered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tens of thousands of people were killed by German troops in what historians call the 20th century's first genocide, in what is now Namibia. The events between 1904 and 1908 foreshadowed the Holocaust. Germany is finally close to recognizing it as such.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tribal elder recounts the story he heard from his forefathers in the 360 video above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pick for energy secretary, former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, is confirmed, he will oversee a department that runs America's nuclear weapons labs. He will also most likely be pressedto resume the testing of nuclear weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some experts fear that testing the U.S. arsenal for the first time since 1992 risks starting an arms race. Others wonder whether the weapons still work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the president-elect suggested that the controversy over alleged Russian interference with the U.S. election should be laid to rest. &quot;We ought to get on with our lives,&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apple has been a frequent target of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who said during the campaign that he would get the technology company to &quot;build their damn computers and things in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our investigation into the company's biggest iPhone factory, which is in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> revealed a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies behind the production of Apple's most profitable product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Each December, predictions of next year's hottest food items barrel forth. We're hearing jackfruit, sorghum and harissa could have their moments in 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a look at similar predictions over the last 20 years (remember bubble tea?) and a deeper exploration of the often dubious work of food-trend forecasting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chart above shows the number of major deals that came undone over the last two decades. In terms of volume, this was the biggest year for busted transactions since the financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The world's wealthiest  people ended 2016 more than $237 billion richer than they were at its start. The gains were led by Warren Buffett, the investor, who added $11.8 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Clean tech&quot; companies, which try to harness natural processes for industrial use, are aiming for a comeback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And here are five resolutions for a simpler tech life, including password hygiene and getting rid of unused devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jacqueline Sauvage became a French symbol of domestic abuse when she went to prison for killing her husband, who had subjected her to decades of violence. President Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande granted her a full pardon on Wednesday. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Germany detained a 40-year-old Tunisian suspected of being an accomplice of Anis Amri, the man believed to have carried out the truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market last week. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Czech Republic said it would set up an &quot;antifake news&quot; unit to counteract what it called Russian interference ahead of its general election next year. [The Guardian]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Romania's Social Democrats nominated Sorin Grindeanu, a regional politician, to be the next prime minister. The president rejected the party's first choice, who would have been the first woman and the first Muslim to hold the office. [Associated Press]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors hostilities in Ukraine, acknowledged that it had been hacked. [BBC]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arkansas detectives investigating a murder are seeking access to audio that may have been recorded on an Amazon Echo device, in a move that raises new questions about electronic privacy. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the first time, Madrid will ban half of all cars from its city center today, to curb air pollution. [El Pa&iacute;s]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ukraine wants investors to harvest solar power in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. [Kyiv Post]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Take a ride in the Flying Scotsman, a beloved British steam engine recently renovated and brought out of retirement, in the 360 video above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In memoriam: Hans Tietmeyer, an architect of the euro, and Lella Vignelli, the Italian designer, who once said: &quot;If you do it right, it will last forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women who took fish oil during the last three months of pregnancy significantly lowered the risk that their children would develop asthma, a new study found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Five-minute walks every hour during the workday can lift your mood, combat lethargy and even dull hunger pangs, a study suggests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And here's a Times sports correspondent reflecting on the pleasures and trepidations of expat life in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case you missed it, an unusual bit of music history was made this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen&quot; song by the Japanese comedian Kazuhito Kosaka - better known by his stage name Pikotaro - went from YouTube to a spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. At 45 seconds, it's the shortest song ever to appear on the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the video has been watched more than 100 million times since its release this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lyrics, while unlikely to win the artist a Nobel Prize in Literature, proved catchy: &quot;I have a pen, I have a apple. Uh! Apple pen!&quot; Many imitations have appeared online, including one by the late-night host Stephen Colbert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there is one thing I need to say: There is someone who in one of the videos actually stabs an apple with a pen,&quot; Mr. Kosaka recently said. &quot;That's a waste.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kosaka is relishing his newfound popularity, but he's wary of becoming just a one-hit wonder. He's said he is working on new music, but this time about citrus fruits.</SPAN></P>
