<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is continuing to build his cabinet. Members of his transition effort's economic and domestic policy teams are expected to begin meeting with agency officials today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> used Twitter to rail at his satirists and critics in the entertainment industry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon took a surprise lead in the first round of voting in the conservative primary for president in France, knocking former President Nicolas Sarkozy out of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Fillon, a former premier, will face Alain Jupp&eacute;, who supporters see as a measured answer to the resurgent far right, in a second round next Sunday. The winner is likely to face the far-right populist Marine Le Pen in the presidential election in April.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's start the week traveling the world using sports team nicknames as our passport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The N.F.L.'s Detroit Lions will continue their long tradition of playing on Thanksgiving. Regal cats aren't native to the Motor City, but the name was meant to inspire the team to be &quot;the monarch of the league.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dreams that the Midwest might one day be tropical may have inspired the team's use of the Honolulu Blue shade for its jerseys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A more fitting nod to weather can be found at the University of Hawaii, where the teams are sometimes called the Rainbow Warriors. The colorful phenomenon supposedly appeared after a big football victory in 1923.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Battle imagery is also popular, and the names aren't always menacing. The Nippon-Ham Fighters honor the meatpacking company that owns the Japanese baseball club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In West Africa, Elephants (Ivory Coast), Sparrowhawks (Togo) and Squirrels (Benin) are some of the animal-theme nicknames that have been used to represent national soccer teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in Asia, Bhutan's underdog squad has a fearsome moniker: the Dragon Boys. The mythical beast also appears on the national jersey for Wales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for whales, they're rarely used in sports. But 100 years ago a baseball team called itself the Whales. Their home, like lions in Detroit, was also unlikely: Chicago.</SPAN></P>
