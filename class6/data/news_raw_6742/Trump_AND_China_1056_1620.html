<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- HILLARY CLINTON is the Democratic nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Really. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Just ask her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She should have been able to finally savor shattering that ''highest, hardest glass ceiling'' -- the one she gloried in putting 18 million cracks in last time around -- when she attends her convention in Philadelphia in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, she is reduced to stomping her feet on CNN, asserting her dominance in a contest that has left her looking anything but dominant. Once more attempting to shake off the old socialist dude hammering her with a sickle, Clinton insisted to Chris Cuomo on Thursday: ''I will be the nominee for my party, Chris. That is already done, in effect. There is no way that I won't be.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's a vexing time for the Clintons. As Bill told a crowd in Fargo, N.D., on Friday, it's been an ''interesting'' year: ''That's the most neutral word I can think of.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After all, why should Bernie Sanders get to be the Democratic nominee when he isn't even a Democrat? And how is Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> going to be the Republican nominee when he considers being a Republican merely a starting bid?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It must be hard for Hillary to look at all the pictures of young women swooning over Bernie as though he were Bieber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She assumed that the fix was in, that she and the D.N.C. had arranged for the coronation that she felt she was robbed of in the tulip craze of 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Everyone just laughed when Sanders, a cranky loner from Vermont with a nondescript Senate record, decided to challenge Queen Hillary. Clinton and her aides intoned -- wink, wink -- that it would be healthy to have a primary fight with Sanders and Martin O'Malley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Bernie became the surprise belle of his side's revolutionary ball. And now he has gotten a taste of it and he likes it and he won't let it go. He's bedeviling the daylight out of Hillary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hillary and her allies are spinning a narrative that Bernie is less loyal to the Democratic cause than she was with Obama. And </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does delight in quoting Bernie's contention that Hillary lacks the judgment to be president. On Friday, when he accepted the endorsement of the N.R.A. at its convention, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mischievously urged Sanders to run as a third-party candidate and said he would love to have a debate with both Hillary and Bernie onstage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hillary says Sanders needs to ''do his part'' to unify the party, as she did in 2008. But even on the day of the last primaries in that race, when she was the one who was mathematically eliminated unless the superdelegates turned, she came onstage to Terry McAuliffe heralding her as ''the next president of the United States.'' She then touted having more votes than any primary candidate in history as her fans cheered ''Yes, she will!'' and ''Denver!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Seeing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> soaring negatives, Sanders thinks, if he could just get past Hillary, he could actually be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Bernie bro violence -- chair throwing, sexist name-calling and feral threats -- at the Nevada state party convention last weekend was denounced as ''a scary situation'' by his Senate colleague Barbara Boxer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sanders condemned the violence while stoking the outrage, urging the Democratic Party to ''open the doors, let the people in.'' He flashed a bit of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, so sure in his belief that the system is rigged that he fed off the nasty energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Boxer had to call Sanders several times before he called back. She and other Democratic Senate women are fed up with his crusade, feeling enough is enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I've talked to several former Clinton and Obama White House aides who don't enjoy checking in with the joyless Clinton campaign in Brooklyn. ''It's the Bataan Death March,'' one says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hopeful acceptance of Hillary has shifted to amazed disbelief that she can't put away Bernie. Given dynasty fatigue and Hillary's age, many Democrats assumed that their front-runner would come out of the gate with a vision for the future that gave her campaign a fresh hue, instead of white papers tinkering around the edges. She should have been far over her husband's bridge to the 21st century and way down the highway by now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, her big new idea is to put Bill in charge of the economy again (hopefully, with less Wall Street deregulation). Again with the two for the price of one. And please don't deny us the pleasure of seeing Bill choose the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">china</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> patterns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hillary's Bataan Death March is making Republicans reconsider their own suicide mission with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. More are looking at Clinton's inability to get the flashing lights going like her husband, and thinking: Huh, maybe we're not dead here. Maybe Teflon Don could pull this off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The 2016 race is transcendentally bizarre. We have two near-nominees with the highest unfavorables at this point in the race of any in modern history. We seem to have a majority of voters in both parties who are driven by the desire to vote against the other candidate, rather than for their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Debbie Wasserman Schultz tries to herd young women to Hillary by raising the specter of Roe v. Wade being overturned. And former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> obsession with ''10s'' and D-cups would ''come back to haunt him'' and give Democrats wins because ''there are probably more ugly women in America than attractive women.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hillary can't generate excitement on her own so she is relying on fear of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to get her into the White House. And </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is relying on fear of everything to get him into the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So voters are stuck in the muck of the negative: What are you most afraid of?</SPAN></P>
