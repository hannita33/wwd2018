<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think we Europeans have control of our destiny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, reacting to President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggestion that NATO was &quot;obsolete&quot; and his prediction that more nations would follow Britain out of the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> criticized Ms. Merkel for her decision to welcome more than a million migrants. He also expressed hope for a nuclear deal with Russia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sought to ease domestic tensions on the holiday celebrating the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., meeting with King's eldest son after feuding with Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights icon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lewis and several other lawmakers say they will not attend the inauguration on Friday. The group planning the festivities said it had raised more than $100 million, nearly double the record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prime Minister Theresa May is scheduled to make a long-awaited speech today on Britain's plans for leaving the E.U.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British news media, which appeared to have been briefed by Downing Street, reported that Ms. May was likely to choose a &quot;hard Brexit,&quot; leaving the bloc's single market and its customs union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some British manufacturers are poised to move production to the Continent. And British banks worry about whether they will be able to keep offering services to clients there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Economic Forum in Davos opens today. For the first time, President Xi Jinping of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will attend the elite gathering in the Swiss Alps, as will Ms. May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a time of Brexit and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the relevance of the &quot;Davos class&quot; is in question, our columnist writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in what may be a related story, the charity Oxfam says eight of the richest men on earth are now as wealthy as the poorer half of the global population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Abdulgadir Masharipov, the man accused of carrying out the New Year's Day shooting rampage in an Istanbul nightclub that killed 39 people, was arrested in an outlying district of the city, the Turkish news media reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities described Mr. Masharipov as an Islamic State militant of Uzbek nationality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cold snap that has gripped Europe forced households across Poland to crank up low-quality heaters, leading to the worst air pollution since monitoring systems were installed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spain, spared most of the cold so far, is bracing for freezing temperatures today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pursued deals in Russia as early as 1987, despite his claims that &quot;we've stayed away.&quot; But little came of his efforts or, later, his children's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president-elect's criticism of German carmakers shows an incomplete understanding of how globalized the industry has become, our Shanghai bureau chief writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luxottica Group, an Italian maker of luxury frames for brands like Chanel and Armani, will merge with Essilor, a French lens manufacturer, in a $49 billion deal that would create a global eyewear giant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celebrations and tributes took place yesterday across the U.S. for Martin Luther King's Birthday, but honors for the slain civil rights hero extend beyond America's borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statues of King appear in Westminster Abbey in London, as well as in Tuzla, a city in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Martin Luther King III visited the Bosnian monument in 2009 during a tour to promote tolerance a decade after a war fed by ethnic divisions tore the region apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bust of King at the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, may have been the most subversive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American sculptor Zenos Frudakis recalled that he risked imprisonment for sneaking the work into the country in 1989, when apartheid was in effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Frudakis said that he waswarned by the U.S. government that he might end up joining Nelson Mandela &quot;breaking rocks&quot; on Robben Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did not breathe easy until my return flight,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bust was placed inside the embassy near its outer fence, safe from the South African authorities but viewable by the public.</SPAN></P>
