</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction Appended</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TOKYO - Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sent shivers across the Japanese auto industry on Friday after warning Toyota on Twitter that he would impose a &quot;big border tax&quot; on the company if it built a new plant in Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appeared to be the first time he had taken on a foreign company for plans that did not directly involve the United States. The effects were immediate: Shares in Toyota and other carmakers fell in trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Friday. And Japanese government officials hustled to respond to the rhetoric with soothing reminders of the jobs that the country's auto manufacturers had created in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Toyota itself has tried to be a good corporate citizen in the U.S. to date,&quot; said Yoshihide Suga, chief cabinet secretary to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daily Gendai, one of Japan's leading tabloid newspapers, declared in a front-page headline that &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tries to smash Toyota,&quot; and another tabloid, Evening Fuji, hinted at a coming battle with its headline, &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vs. Toyota.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout his presidential campaign, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he would punish American companies that moved manufacturing plants offshore. Soon after his election, he claimed credit for persuading Carrier, the air-conditioner company, to keep 1,000 jobs in Indiana that it had previously planned to move to Mexico. And he thanked Ford Motor on Twitter this week for abandoning plans to build a small-car assembly plant in Mexico that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had repeatedly criticized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twitter post was not entirely accurate. He said Toyota would build a new Corolla factory in Baja, but the company is actually planning to build a new plant in Guanajuato, Mexico. (It already has a factory in Baja.) More significant, Toyota's new plant in Mexico will not replace any of its 10 factories in the United States, where the company employs 136,000 people. The company said it had invested about $21.9 billion in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think being fair is not really in the playbook of the president-elect,&quot; said Takuji Okubo, managing director and chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toyota builds Corollas in Cambridge, Ontario, as well as in Blue Springs, Miss. No workers in either of those plants will lose jobs, and when Toyota opens the new facility in Mexico, the company plans to shift the Canadian workers to making small RAV4 sport utility vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Hiroshige Seko, Japan's minister of economy, trade and industry, Japanese carmakers manufactured about 3.86 million cars in the United States in 2015, up from 1.5 million in the 1990s, and employ about 1.5 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to a question about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> post at a meeting of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota, said the company would not change its manufacturing plans in Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know yet exactly how, but, regardless of who becomes president, our business is about being good corporate citizens,&quot; Mr. Toyoda said, according to a report by The Associated Press. &quot;And by becoming good corporate citizens, we are facing the same goal of making America strong. And so we will continue to do our best.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though there are only two weeks left to the inauguration, some analysts suggested Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might still be in campaign-promise mode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the moment, it's quite unclear whether Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> actually will push this policy after assuming office,&quot; said Yoshio Tsukuda, founder of Tsukuda Mobility Research Institute, an auto industry research firm. &quot;Right now we don't know if he is just bluffing or serious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But others said some of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> words could spur changes on their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the threat alone can actually force companies to behave in a more </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> way,&quot; Mr. Okubo said. &quot;So I think regardless of whether the border tax would actually be implemented, I think he will continue to use the threat to pressure companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> singled out Toyota on Thursday, analysts said that his views on trade clearly extended beyond a single company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S. is no longer a champion of free trade as a nation,&quot; wrote Genki Fujii, visiting professor at Takushoku University in Tokyo, in a column in Evening Fuji.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In comments to the Japanese broadcaster NHK, Takao Shindo, president of Nippon Steel &amp; Sumitomo Metal Corporation, expressed concerns that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would repeal the North American Free Trade Agreement, which affects Japanese manufacturers with plants in Mexico shipping to the United States. These companies &quot;will face a tough situation,&quot; Mr. Shindo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts said that once Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> understood what Toyota was doing with its plants, he might back down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Toyota still is expanding local U.S. production in the long term,&quot; said Takaki Nakanishi, an independent auto industry analyst in Tokyo. &quot;Not at this point in time, because the U.S. market is near saturation, but over the long term I think there is more capacity to expand the Mississippi plant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Job growth is coming in the long term&quot; in the United States, he added. &quot;That's why I think Donald is misunderstanding Toyota's intention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Nakanishi, who was on his way to the annual North American International Auto Show in Detroit, said he was not surprised by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rhetoric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wants to protect jobs for the United States,&quot; he said. &quot;So regardless of the origin of the company, he is just trying to do his job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan has already been rattled by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election given his campaign criticism of Japanese trade barriers and the cost of United States military support. Prime Minister Abe was the first world leader to land a meeting with the president-elect, and he is seeking a follow-up meeting shortly after the inauguration. His advisers have also been meeting with members of Congress and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some economists fear that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could return to the trade wars of the 1980s with his policies. Jun Saito, a senior research fellow at the Japan Center for Economic Research, said economic conditions were starting to resemble those of the United States in the 1980s, when the dollar was stronger and the country had a large trade deficit with Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was the background for the trade friction between Japan and the United States,&quot; Mr. Saito said. Japan's trade surplus with the United States - about 7.2 trillion yen, or about $62 billion, in 2015 - is smaller than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but it could nevertheless draw Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ire. &quot;I think we have to be very careful. We can't be too optimistic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Okubo of Japan Macro Advisors said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might also accuse the Bank of Japan of currency manipulation, given that in inflation-adjusted terms, the yen is at a 40-year low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this could be just the beginning,&quot; Mr. Okubo said. &quot;I think the Japanese government has to be really careful not to act in a way that could be interpreted as manipulating the exchange rate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the source of a quote from Akio Toyoda about Toyota's being good a corporate citizen. He was speaking to the Associated Press, not Japan Today.</SPAN></P>
