</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HONG KONG - Before this week, few Chinese citizens had probably heard of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe, an island nation off the west coast of Africa. But the country has risen into their good graces after deciding to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan, a self-governing island that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> regards as a breakaway province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision, announced by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday, reduces the number of countries that have formal relations with Taiwan to 21. It comes after Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, who took office in May, shattered diplomatic protocol in early December and startled Beijing by speaking with the American president-elect, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appreciates and welcomes S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe's return to the right track of the one-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> principle,&quot; Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saidat a news briefing on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beijing has long refused to have diplomatic relations with any country that does not recognize it as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sole government. Taiwan, where the defeated Chinese Nationalist forces retreated after the civil war in 1949, is formally known as the Republic of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. For decades, Beijing and Taipei competed for recognition as the country named &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' but in 1979 the United States switched its support and formally established diplomatic relations with Beijing, and most countries have since done the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts said S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe could be just the first diplomatic defection by a small country eager to establish formal relations with Beijing instead of Taipei, as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is increasingly seen as the richer benefactor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it might trigger a domino effect,&quot; Richard W. X. Hu, a professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong, said in an email on Thursday. He added that Beijing was &quot;increasingly determined to squeeze Taipei's international space&quot; in response to the election of Ms. Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally favored independence for Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news briefing in Taipei on Wednesday, Taiwan's foreign minister, David Lee, declined to provide details of how S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe, a former Portuguese colony with a population of less than 200,000, had arrived at its decision to sever diplomatic ties. Ms. Hua, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, did not say when the African country would formally establish diplomatic relations with Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports in Taiwan's news media suggested that S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe's decision had come from Taipei's refusal to agree to a request for financial support. Taiwan's state-run Central News Agency quoted an unnamed official at the Foreign Ministry as saying that S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe had sought $200 million from Taipei as part of what the agency's report called &quot;checkbook diplomacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zhang Baohui, a political scientist at Lingnan University in Hong Kong, said S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;'s decision to switch diplomatic allegiance had probably been orchestrated by Beijing and had broader political overtones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like something inconsequential, but actually it means a lot for cross-strait relations,&quot; Mr. Zhang said, referring to the body of water that separates Taiwan from the Chinese mainland. &quot;Basically it means Beijing has a new Taiwan strategy: They're going back to their confrontational style, and the truce with Taiwan over the past eight years is over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Tsai's predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, had promoted closer ties with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zhang said that before Ms. Tsai took office, Beijing had reportedly denied requests by several African and Latin American countries to establish formal diplomatic relations with Beijing instead of Taipei. The purpose at the time, he said, was to reward Mr. Ma for his role in stabilizing relations between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Taiwan and to help him avoid &quot;embarrassing&quot; diplomatic episodes that could damage his domestic political capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zhang added that the move by S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe could be read as &quot;part of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> punishment of Tsai for calling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> answered a congratulatory telephone call from Ms. Tsai this month, he became the first American president or president-elect to speak to a Taiwan leader since at least 1979. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> later said that he viewed the &quot;One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' policy that has informed relations between Washington and Beijing since the 1970s as ripe for review, and Beijing responded by blaming Ms. Tsai's government for arranging the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, said that S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe's decision was merely a beginning, and that Taiwan could lose all of its diplomatic partners if the Democratic Progressive Party &quot;continues to pursue Taiwan independence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sina Weibo, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> equivalent of Twitter, people welcomed the African country into the Chinese fold, even as some conceded that their grasp of its geography was hazy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should work harder to get the rest of those 21 countries,&quot; one person posted. &quot;Then Taiwan would be truly 'independent.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
