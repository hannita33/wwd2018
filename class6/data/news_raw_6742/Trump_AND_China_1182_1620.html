</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FRONT PAGE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article on Dec. 4 about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> likely re-evaluation of President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after his telephone call to Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, referred incompletely to the presidential candidacy of Hung Hsui-chu of the Kuomintang party. Favored by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, she initially challenged Ms. Tsai, but later dropped out of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article on Dec. 4 about admiration on both sides of the Atlantic for Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, among white ethnocentrists, nationalists, populists and neo-Nazis misspelled, in some editions, the given name of President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new chief strategist, an alt-right figure who has not wholly embraced Mr. Putin. He is Stephen K. Bannon, not Steven.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INTERNATIONAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article on Monday about some of the victims of a terror attack on an Istanbul nightclub misidentified the occupation of one of those killed, Haykal Mousallem of Lebanon. He was a fitness trainer, not a businessman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article on Dec. 10 about the conviction of Geert Wilders, a Dutch far-right leader, on charges of inciting discrimination and insulting a group misstated the action that led to that conviction. He led an anti-Moroccan chant at a political rally in the Netherlands; although he had previously said the country would be safer with fewer Moroccans, he was acquitted of hate-speech charges in connection with that statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of an editing error, an article on Dec. 4 about the Mentawai people of Indonesia, who have resisted government policies for decades but now face a generational divide as their children embrace the modern world, referred incorrectly in some editions to Teu Kapik Sikalabai, the wife of Teu Kapik Sibajak, a Mentawai elder. Mr. Kapik is a Sikkerei, a special class of shamans and forest healers, but Ms. Kapik is not; only men can be in that class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article on Nov. 27 about homeowners who refused to sell their property to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Golf Links in Balmedie, Scotland - and lost their sea view when Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> workers built a wall - referred incorrectly to a contest won by Sarah Malone, a vice president of the golf course. It was a regional marketing campaign, not a beauty pageant. (Ms. Malone sent an email pointing out the error shortly after publication; this correction was delayed because editors did not follow through on the complaint.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article on Saturday about a decision by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to commute the sentence of the driver of the getaway car in the infamous 1981 robbery of a Brink's armored car in Rockland County, N.Y., misstated the given name of the guard who was killed. He was Peter Paige, not Paul Paige.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUSINESS DAY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A chart on Dec. 28 with article about potential conflicts of interest among members named to a biotechnology panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, using information erroneously posted on the website of the Engineering Biology Research Consortium, referred incorrectly to Mary Maxon and David Rejeski, two of the 13 members of the panel. They do not have any connection to the consortium. As a result, seven of the members of the panel have potential conflicts of interest, not nine. The article, using the same information from the website, misstated the number of people connected to the consortium who are also members of the biotechnology panel. It is three, not five.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPORTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first seven paragraphs of an article about the Los Angeles Rams' return to the city after 21 years in St. Louis were omitted from some editions on Sunday. The full article, by Ken Belson, can be found at nytimes.com/sports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OBITUARIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article on Saturday about the deaths of major figures in 2016 misstated the cause of death of the basketball coach Pat Summitt. It was Alzheimer's disease, not cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An obituary on Tuesday about Archbishop Hilarion Capucci, who as the head of the Greek Catholic Church in Jerusalem was arrested in 1974 and charged with aiding Palestinian militants, described the location of Nazareth incorrectly. It is in northern Israel, not in the West Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOOD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article last Wednesday about American sheep's milk cheeses misspelled the name of the Wisconsin city where Hidden Springs Creamery is located. It is Westby, not Wesby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article last Wednesday about the forecasters of food trends misspelled the surname of a popular musician. She is Alanis Morissette, not Morrisette.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A review last Wednesday about the Odeon restaurant in TriBeCa misstated the location of the wheelchair-accessible restroom. It is downstairs (and reached by elevator), not on the sidewalk level. The review also misstated the relationship between Lynn Wagenknecht and Keith McNally when they opened the Odeon in 1980. They were not married until more than three years later.</SPAN></P>
