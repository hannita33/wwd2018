<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Democrats and Republicans agreed on almost nothing at their conventions this month, except this: free trade, just a decade ago the bedrock of the economic agendas of both parties, is now a political pariah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters, many of whom supported Senator Bernie Sanders, swarmed into Philadelphia this week and heckled speakers, even President Obama, over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that was finalized this year. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, who has tried to help Mr. Obama achieve this signature trade pact, renounced his support for the deal last week when he joined Hillary Clinton's ticket. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has made unraveling the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the largest regional trade accord in history, the centerpiece of his campaign, upending more than half a century of Republican orthodoxy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fragile pro-trade coalition on Capitol Hill once led by Republicans is also unspooling, and congressional approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would include 12 countries that together account for roughly 40 percent of the global economy, seems increasingly unlikely during the Obama presidency. Republican leaders in both chambers are not planning to bring it up this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Opponents of multilateral trade agreements, convinced that they have unduly harmed American workers, have enjoyed a stunning success that may signal a long-term political and policy realignment in both parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Republicans, proponents of free trade for decades, have found their base this year expanding to include anti-trade voters from poor and working-class areas who have joined forces, if not voting habits, with the Democrats' most liberal voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The primaries created seismic changes,'' said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York. ''It will never be the same again. Neither Republicans nor Democrats will ever again be unabashed advocates for trade.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Candidates often turn against free trade only to embrace it as president, as Mr. Obama notably did. Mrs. Clinton also changed her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership during the campaign after championing it as secretary of state. Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia suggested this week that Mrs. Clinton would reverse as Mr. Obama did if elected, only to be strongly batted down by campaign officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> criticism of the trade pact is far more frontal. In addition to tearing up the deal, he has said he would slap a 45 percent tax on imports from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He believes he can attract liberal voters with this pitch, which he posted on Twitter this month, ''To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals &amp; global special interests, we welcome you with open arms.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In some ways, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is pulling Republicans back to their protectionist prewar roots. They were the party of the ultimately disastrous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which raised tariffs on imports, a position that was later reversed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Democrats, with their deep ties to organized labor, have soured on trade deals in recent decades, especially in the wake of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was signed into law by the Clinton administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They say the deals have cost manufacturing jobs and lowered wages, though global trade accounts for fewer lost jobs than automation and other technological advances. (The apparel and furniture sectors, which employed many of the workers now backing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, are exceptions.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In surveys, most Americans typically say free trade on the whole is positive, a fact often cited by its supporters. But polls also show that people are less optimistic about trade's effect on jobs at home. Americans are more likely to say that international trade diminishes wages more than it improves them, and that it results in jobs losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The anti-trade talk ''resonates with people who have been on the short end of the stick,'' said Jeffrey J. Schott, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are a wide range of reasons why this segment of the population has been left behind,'' he added. ''Both the attacks on trade and on Mrs. Clinton are a surrogate for concerns about globalization.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The shift was visible among Republicans early this year when the embattled incumbent Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and a former United States trade representative in the second Bush administration, came out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other Republicans have since remained quiet, or also pulled back. Mr. Portman, who is in a tough re-election fight against Ted Strickland, the former Ohio governor, recently received the endorsement of the Ohio Conference of Teamsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These are positions that worry the administration greatly. ''Globalization is a force, and trade agreements are how we shape globalization,'' said Michael B. Froman, the United States trade representative who has been criticized on Capitol Hill all year from members of both parties. ''There is a lot of rhetoric in the campaign that reflects real anger and concerns about changes in our economy, but the right prescription is not to get out of trade agreements.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said ''the White House is making progress, but it needs to pick up the pace and pick it up significantly.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added, ''Congress has the final say on whether trade is good for our country and workers, and there are outstanding issues that have eroded that support.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sanders and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have relentlessly bashed the Trans-Pacific Partnership and multilateral trade deals throughout the campaign, pushing Mrs. Clinton toward Mr. Sanders's position and leaving Republicans largely scared into silence, or equivocating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's been a one-sided conversation in this race, which is unfortunate,'' said Representative Ron Kind, Democrat of Wisconsin, who is a rare member of his party in the House who supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trade supporters are trying to counter the anti-trade crowd with local advertisements, posts on Twitter, op-ed articles and town-hall-style meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The current rhetoric about trade is in members' minds,'' Mr. Froman said, ''but we are working hard to push back against misinformation that is out there.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The White House is trying to allay concerns in Congress about when and how member countries will change their laws to adjust to the agreement and how the data of financial companies will be treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A fight over how intellectual property protections are managed for the biopharmaceutical industry has been sticky, and the topic has been the subject of discussions between the administration and Republicans in Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, there is deep resistance to voting on the trade measure. ''The chances are pretty slim that we'd be looking at that this year,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. House leaders are equally indifferent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton has expressed strong reservations to aspects of the deal, and it is not clear what she would do to move a trade pact forward as president. Even less is known about what Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> approach might be, other than his assertions that his deal-making prowess would achieve accords that are better for workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even so, the long-term impacts on both parties seem inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are not going back to business as usual,'' Mr. Schott said. ''If Mrs. Clinton wins, I think there are feasible ways for her to fix what is broken and make it better. If Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wins, he wants to just break the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">china,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and once he does that, you won't be able to put the pieces together again.''</SPAN></P>
