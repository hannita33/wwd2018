<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Here's what you need to know at the end of the day.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good evening. Here's the latest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. We'll get to the major stories of the day in a second, but first, as you head into your weekend, we wanted to bring you a reminder that we still live in a world of wonders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We asked our science reporters to share the most memorable stories they reported on this year. Here's what they told us.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. President Obama warned that the American government would respond to Russia's efforts to influence the presidential election with &quot;a clear message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference, before leaving for vacation in Hawaii, he defended his restrained response to the hacking and said that he told Vladimir Putinto &quot;cut it out&quot; months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton spoke out on Thursday, accusing Mr. Putin of ordering the hack &quot;because he has a personal beef against me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The reaction to President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nominee for ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, above, has been highly polarized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer with no diplomatic experience, has long espoused hard-right, pro-Israel views that are often at odds with United States policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has filled most top positions in his cabinet, but still has not named a Democrat. He is continuing his victory tour with a rally in Florida tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The process of evacuating residents from the last rebel-held section of Aleppo broke down on Friday amid confusion and concerns over reports of summary killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 8,000 people have been taken out of the Syrian city, but many thousands are said to remain. Videos shared on social media showed the harrowing evacuation journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The war in Syria has garnered international attention, but in Yemen, another conflict has been largely forgotten by the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our journalists went there last month to report on the devastating effects of the fighting, which has displaced more than 2.5 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has publicly kept its distance from the war, but Saudi pilots - who have been bombing rebels in the capital, Sana - often fly American-made fighter jets and drop American-made munitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The United States is demanding the return of an underwater drone that has been seized by a Chinese warship in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. The drone was carrying out scientific research when it went missing, a Defense Department official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> signaled that it had installed weapons on disputed islands in the waterway. American officials are trying to determine whether the seizure was a low-level action taken by Chinese sailors, or if it was more strategic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In North Carolina, the Republican-controlled state legislature approved a sweeping package of restrictions to curb the powers Governor-elect Roy Cooper, a Democrat, above. One of them was quickly signed by the outgoing one-term Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Protesters were removed from the House and Senate galleries after yelling and chanting, and a number of people were arrested throughout the day in acts of civil disobedience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. There's a special resonance to tonight's broadcast of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; It features Cindy Stowell, who was on a winning streak, even as she battled Stage 4 colon cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Stowell died on Dec. 5, before her episodes began airing. Her fan base is now enormous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Frigid temperatures continue to hang over the northern half of the United States, and some areas are expecting snow, sleet and freezing rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it doesn't look like it's going to warm up this weekend. If you're planning to stay inside, here's a guide to streaming the best movies of 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Above, a 5-year-old boy in Maine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. On the topic of being cold, here's a look at the sport of ice swimming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Competitions take place in water that is 41 degrees or less, and the risk to the body is real. Still, the races seem to attract interest in spite of the dangers, or perhaps because of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm being honest, when it's over, the euphoria is incredible,&quot; said one swimmer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Finally, we bring you a story of good intentions - which, as we all know, sometimes fall short (specifically, in this case, six feet short).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Montreal, there was an idea to celebrate the city's upcoming 375th anniversary by putting up a Christmas tree bigger and grander than the famous one in New York. Then everything went wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tree is skinny, misshapen and widely unloved, but let's not forget: Charlie Brown's Christmas tree was, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help.</SPAN></P>
