<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GETTYSBURG, Pa. -- Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> came to this historic battlefield town Saturday to offer his vision for America's future, saying he hoped to ''heal the divisions'' of the country as President Lincoln tried to do here seven score and 13 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet in his own Gettysburg address, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has been sliding in the polls less than three weeks before Election Day, did not offer much in the way of race-changing oratory and did not seem to embrace Lincoln's unifying ambition. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, the Republican nominee used the first third of what had been promoted as a ''closing argument'' speech to nurse personal grievances, grumbling about ''the rigging of this election'' and ''the dishonest mainstream media,'' and threatening to sue the women who have come forward -- an 11th woman did on Saturday -- to accuse him of aggressive sexual advances.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign -- total fabrication,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. ''The events never happened. Never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And the more substantive part of the speech, intended to outline his first 100 days in office if he were elected president, did not quite live up to its billing by campaign aides, who had promised a major policy address not unlike Newt Gingrich's 1994 ''Contract with America.'' Instead, a subdued Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- who on Friday acknowledged the possibility of electoral defeat -- largely repeated his existing campaign promises, from renegotiating trade deals to enforcing tougher immigration laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> carefully scripted presentation on Saturday was meant to project a new level of forethought and seriousness from a man not usually associated with either. His proposals had legislative titles like the ''Affordable Child Care and Elder Care Act'' and the ''Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The speech, before a small, handpicked crowd, was also a recognition that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> needs to establish himself as someone with the discipline and temperament to lead the nation. ''Hillary Clinton is not running against me, she's running against change,'' he said. ''And she's running against all of the American people and all of the American voters.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did offer specific immigration proposals, including an ''End Illegal Immigration Act'' that would establish mandatory minimum prison sentences for undocumented immigrants caught illegally re-entering the country after deportation. He also said he would stop issuing visas to any country that refused to take in citizens ordered deported from the United States, a policy that would almost certainly disrupt immigration and commerce with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> which is one such country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also reiterated his promise to build a border wall with Mexico and have Mexico pay for it, though he hedged a bit, saying, ''the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall.'' (At a rally in Cleveland later on Saturday, his most energetic of the day, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was back to leading his crowd in chants calling for Mexico to pay for the wall.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Repeating earlier pledges to ''drain the swamp'' in Washington, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promised to push through a series of new ethics laws, as well as term limits for both the House and Senate. And he called for ''a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce the federal work force through attrition, exempting military, public safety and public health.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has a long history of threatening and occasionally following though on litigation, and in raising the possibility of suing his female accusers, he may have simply been trying to stop more from coming forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a news conference on Saturday in Los Angeles, Jessica Drake, an adult film actress, claimed that, after meeting Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at a 2006 charity golf event in Lake Tahoe, Nev., she had accepted an invitation to meet in his hotel room. Not wanting to go alone, Ms. Drake said she was accompanied by a couple of female friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Drake, who appeared Saturday with the women's rights lawyer Gloria Allred, said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had hugged and kissed her and the other women without permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After returning to her room, Ms. Drake said, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or a man phoning on his behalf offered her $10,000 to return to his room, which she declined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign called the accusation ''another example of the Clinton campaign trying to rig the election.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not know this person, does not remember this person and would have no interest in ever knowing her,'' it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Aboard her campaign plane, Mrs. Clinton said: ''I saw where our opponent, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, went to Gettysburg, one of the most extraordinary places in American history, and basically said if he's president he'll spend his time suing women who have made charges against him based on his behavior.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She added, ''I'm going to keep talking about what we want to do, what we think the country deserves from the next president and vice president, and when it comes right down to it, I think that's what people are going to vote on.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At her rally Saturday in Pennsylvania, Mrs. Clinton devoted much of her remarks to the state's contentious Senate race, giving an extended plug to the Democratic candidate, Katie McGinty, and attacking the Republican incumbent, Senator Patrick J. Toomey, for not denouncing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for his vulgar remarks about women captured in a recording.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Bloomberg News poll conducted this month after the release of the tape showed Mrs. Clinton with a nine percentage point lead over Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Pennsylvania. On Saturday, she tried to offer an olive branch to the white working-class voters there who have gravitated to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You probably know people who are thinking about voting for Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' she told the crowd of 1,800 gathered in a high school gymnasium. ''Here's what I want you to tell them: Tell them that I understand they need a president who cares about them, will listen to them, and I want to be their president, too.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After his appearance in Gettysburg, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reverted to his trusted stump speech in back-to-back rallies in Virginia Beach and Cleveland, exciting large crowds by attacking Mrs. Clinton and promising to bring back jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You're going to look back at this rally and you're going to remember it for the rest of your life because this will be the beginning,'' he said in Virginia. ''You're going to remember Nov. 8 because your country is going to be a country that starts winning again.''</SPAN></P>
