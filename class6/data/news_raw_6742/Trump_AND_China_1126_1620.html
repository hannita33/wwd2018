</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next stop: Iowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will hold a rally in Des Moines tonight, a day after tapping the state's governor, Terry Branstad, to be ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Branstad calls himself an &quot;old friend&quot; of the Chinese leader, President Xi Jinping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on Wednesday, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nominated Oklahoma's attorney general, Scott Pruitt, to run the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Pruitt has helped lead a legal battle against President Obama's climate change policies and is viewed as an ally of the fossil-fuel industry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's it like to interview for a role in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration? We spoke with a few recent job hopefuls about their experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Glimpses into the inauguration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect has been discussing plans for the Jan. 20 celebration with Mark Burnett, who produced &quot;The Apprentice,&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reality TV show. Mr. Burnett has suggested that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fly to the Washington ceremony by helicopter and that he hold a parade on Fifth Avenue in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other members of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inner circle say the event will be &quot;simple.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> California fire inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As officials continue investigating the warehouse blaze that killed 36 people in Oakland, we'vesenta team of reporters there to answer questions about the cause of the fire and what the tragedy says about gentrification in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll be sharing updates on what we find and have set up an email address for readers to help us track down information: oaklandfire@nytimes.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dylann Roof trial begins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors are hearing testimony in the federal death penalty trial of the avowed white supremacist accused of killing nine black congregants at a church in Charleston, S.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I watched my son come in this world and I watched my son leave this world,&quot; Felicia Sanders, a survivor of the attack whose son was killed, told the jury on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The intel on this wasn't 100 percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was Edgar M. Welch, who the police say fired a weapon inside Comet Ping Pong, a Washington pizzeria that has faced online attacks over false news articles claiming that it was at the center of a child sex slave ring. No one was hurt in the episode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just wanted to do some good and went about it the wrong way,&quot; he told our reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A child's tweets about Syrian war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are trapped under bombs.&quot; That's one post from the Twitter account of a 7-year-old girl in Aleppo, Bana al-Abed, who has captured global attention with notes about bombs, death and despair. But there are questions about the authenticity of the posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, Syrian government forces appear to be pushing deeper into rebel-held parts of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Airbnb has faced regulatory battles in cities like New York, San Francisco and Barcelona, Spain. But in New Orleans, the online room-rental company appears to have found a partner willing to compromise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier, we mentioned a professor's grim assessment of fixing income inequality, which involved all-out thermonuclear war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portland, Ore., is taking a different approach: Lawmakers have voted to impose an additional 10 percent in taxes on companies whose chief executives earn more than 100 times the median pay of their rank-and-file workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rest in peace, gadgets. Our tech columnist says the age of must-have devices (think Walkmans, iPods or Fitbits) is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why? The smartphone has proved to be the elusive &quot;Thing That Does Everything,&quot; he writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. stocks were up on Wednesday. Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One last rescue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our 360 video takes you aboard the Bourbon Argos as it conducts its final rescue mission of the year, aiding African migrants in the Mediterranean Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Remarkable recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A patient whose colon cancer had spread to her lungs may hold the key to new treatment options for thousands of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celine Ryan's unusual genetic makeup allowed an experimental treatment that used cells from her own immune system to successfully target a mutation scientists called &quot;undruggable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, she has no signs of cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ruffled feathers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada is one of the world's major bird habitats, but the country has never adopted a bird as a national symbol. A contest held byCanadian Geographic magazine led to the nomination of the gray jay. The choice was not popular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recipe of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't wait until Friday to enjoy some comfort food, try chicken cutlets with mushroom dressing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you look at bank notes across the world, you most often see portraits of men. But images of women are beginning to proliferate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, the U.S. said it would put the abolitionist and former slave Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill. Argentina added a female guerrilla leader who fought Spanish colonialists on the back of its new 10 peso note. Colombia honored a female painter and an anthropologist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Swedish bank notes show the actress Greta Garbo and theWagnerian soprano Birgit Nilsson. And Scotland selected the novelist Nan Shepherd and Mary Somerville, a trailblazing scientist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poland, in a less contemporary choice, selected Dobrawa, a 10th-century Bohemian princess credited with bringing Christianity to her people, for a commemorative note.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, Canada will announce the first woman other than royalty to be featured solo on a bank note. A survey conducted in May suggested that Nellie McClung, a women's rights activist, was the most popular choice, but she is not among the five finalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Toronto Star is rooting for Emily Pauline Johnson, who celebrated her Mohawk heritage in her poetry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its editorial, invoking Ms. Johnson's aboriginal name, concludes: &quot;Ideally, all these women should be featured on bank notes. But if it must be just one, we vote for Tekahionwake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Boehler contributed reporting.</SPAN></P>
