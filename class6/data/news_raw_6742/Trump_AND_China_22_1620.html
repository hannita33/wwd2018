<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> motives for his unorthodox call with the leader of Taiwan remain mysterious, but some Republicans are hailing his improvisational diplomacy as a refreshing break with diplomatic rituals that date to the Richard M. Nixon administration. It could lay the groundwork, they say, for a healthier relationship with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question, as often with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, is whether he will have the discipline to see through these changes. In short, was the phone call the start of a calculated policy, or was it merely a one-off gesture that will alienate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and leave Taiwan even more isolated? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So far the messages from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> camp are mixed. Vice President-elect Mike Pence insisted on Sunday that people were reading too much into the conversation with President Tsai Ing-wen, and that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was simply accepting congratulations from the ''democratically elected leader of Taiwan.'' But people advising the transition say Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> knew exactly what he was doing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Certainly, the president-elect has done nothing to defuse the tensions stirred by the call. A string of vituperative Twitter posts by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the weekend on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade and military policies has fanned questions about whether he wants to reset the relationship with Beijing more fundamentally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But there is no dispute that several people involved in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign have long favored opening more formal channels between the United States and Taiwan as a way to put pressure on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. And Republicans being considered for top jobs applaud what they view as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> determination to use Taiwan as a chip in a geopolitical contest with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's the first president since the Shanghai Communique who provides an opportunity to look fresh at the cross-strait relationship,'' said Jon M. Huntsman Jr., who served as ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> under President Obama. Mr. Huntsman was referring to the 1972 statement, issued after Nixon's visit to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which sharply constrained America's dealings with Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Huntsman's name has recently surfaced as a candidate for secretary of state, along with that of John R. Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush. Mr. Bolton met with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the day he took the phone call from Ms. Tsai. Later, he said the United States ''should shake up the relationship'' with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> himself seemed to take umbrage at the suggestion that he needed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> approval to speak with Ms. Tsai. In two posts on Twitter, he wrote: ''Did </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ask us if it was O.K. to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea? I don't think so!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After an initial relatively mild response, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stiffened its protests of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> freewheeling diplomacy. The Chinese warned Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in a front-page editorial in the overseas edition of People's Daily, that ''creating troubles for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-U.S. relationship is creating troubles for the U.S. itself.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> often uses the overseas edition of People's Daily to test-run major policy pronouncements. In a pointed rejoinder to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the editorial said that pushing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Taiwan ''would greatly reduce the chance to achieve the goal of making America great again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By going after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policies on trade and security, however, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeared to be confirming his intent to take a tougher line with the Chinese leadership across a broader range of issues -- and further dampened hopes in Beijing that he might step back from the campaign rhetoric he has used, including threats of punishing trade tariffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such a stance would reflect his foreign policy advisers, who have criticized the Obama administration for being weak toward Beijing. Alex Grey, a member of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State Department transition team, wrote an article, with another </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> adviser, Peter Navarro, in Foreign Policy magazine last month in which he described Mr. Obama's treatment of Taiwan as ''egregious.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This beacon of democracy in Asia is perhaps the most militarily vulnerable U.S. partner anywhere in the world,'' Mr. Grey and Mr. Navarro wrote, declaring that the island needed a ''comprehensive arms deal'' with the United States to ''deter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> covetous gaze.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reince Priebus, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> designated chief of staff, also has a history with Taiwan. In October 2015, he met with Ms. Tsai in Taipei as part of a delegation from the Republican National Committee. After Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> selected Mr. Priebus, Taiwan's foreign minister, David Lee, told a legislative session that the appointment was ''good news for Taiwan.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pro-Taiwan groups in Washington played down their role in orchestrating the call. But they welcomed it as a step to restore balance in the three-way relationship between Washington, Beijing and Taipei. They also said it need not provoke a confrontation with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's absurd that we talk about going to war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to defend Taiwan, and our presidents can't talk to each other,'' said Randall Schriver, the chief executive of the Project 2049 Institute, a Washington think tank that favors closer American ties with Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Chinese understand this,'' Mr. Schriver continued. ''They don't want to see their efforts to isolate Taiwan rolled back, but they also don't want a bad relationship with the U.S.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> experts said they saw value in Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> desire to rethink old diplomatic protocols. As Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has observed, it is difficult to explain to ordinary people why the United States sells advanced weapons to Taiwan but the leaders cannot speak to each other. Some </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> scholars say it is not clear the policy serves the United States all that well -- nor is it clear that Beijing would not learn to live with a closer American relationship with Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The trouble, said some, is that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> needlessly antagonized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by trumpeting the phone call and then following it up with a series of defiant tweets. ''It's not the phone call that's the problem; it's the making it public that's the problem,'' said Shelley Rigger, a professor of political science at Davidson College who specializes in Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That could put President Xi Jinping in a difficult position, forced to choose between playing down Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attacks and risking a backlash at home, or raising the stakes by pushing back more forcefully and setting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a potential collision course with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Chinese government's initial reaction to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> call has already drawn a torrent of criticism on social media from Chinese who complained that it was not tough enough. The statement from the foreign minister, Wang Yi, which was relatively low key, given the unprecedented nature of the call, refrained from criticizing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, instead accusing Taiwan of playing a ''little trick'' on the president-elect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That offered Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a face-saving way out of the imbroglio, and a chance to de-escalate. But the messages he posted on Twitter late Sunday stepped up the pressure on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweets and actions appear to be more than a symbolic act,'' said James E. Fanell, a former director of intelligence and information operations for the United States Pacific Fleet. ''This will upset Beijing, but it is going to remind the rest of the Indo-Asia Pacific region that the new administration is not going to be fettered by the past.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some Chinese analysts see Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as striking out on a starkly different path from Mr. Obama's, determined to strenuously compete with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on economic issues. But mindful of his career as a negotiator, some view last week's moves optimistically as an opening gambit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''By showing strength at the beginning, he may hope to gain advantages in bargaining later with the Chinese,'' said Zhang Baohui, a professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. ''He is a businessman, and he could be bringing his business bargaining tactics to interstate relations.''</SPAN></P>
