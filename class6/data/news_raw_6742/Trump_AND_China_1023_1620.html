</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good evening. Here's the latest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The world will have to wait a bit longer to see who President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appoints to his cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process has been slowed by a series of shake-ups at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower, which has also virtually frozen the handoff of critical information from the current administration. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has played down the disarray.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There wasplenty of disarray outside the tower, too. (See above.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The front-runner for secretary of state, Rudolph Giuliani, is facing questions about whether his business ties should disqualify him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, whose country has been torn apart by a five-year war, called Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;a natural ally&quot; in the fight against terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Democrats are taking a &quot;big tent&quot; approach as they try to recover from the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Senate, they chose Chuck Schumer, above, as the incoming minority leader, and announced a 10-member leadership team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new team includes Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, but also figures like Joe Manchin, the blue-collar conservative from West Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. President Obama met with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany as part of his last international tour as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his first stop, in Greece, he visited the Acropolis, above, and told an audience in Athens that &quot;American democracy is bigger than any one person.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He heads to Peru next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The police officer who killed Philando Castile, the African-American driver whose graphic death in Minnesota was streamed live on Facebook, was charged with second-degree manslaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Castile's death attracted almost immediate international attention, largely because of the video, filmed by Mr. Castile's distraught girlfriend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer, Jeronimo Yanez, is set to appear in court on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Bob Dylan will not attend the ceremony for his Nobel Prize in Literature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Swedish Academy, which gives out the award, said Mr. Dylan told it he had &quot;pre-existing commitments&quot; on Dec. 10, the day of the ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He underscored, once again, that he feels very honored indeed, wishing that he could receive the prize in person,&quot; the academy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was unclear what the prior commitment was. Mr. Dylan's website lists no tour dates past Nov. 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The International Energy Agency said the landmark climate accord reached in Paris almost a year ago is too weak to meet its temperature target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama says he will try to persuade Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not to quit the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Melting glaciers, like the one in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> above, have been one of the most visible harbingers of climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">___</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The protests over an oil pipeline in Standing Rock, N.D., are the most visible sign of an emerging movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Native American tribes across the U.S. and Canada are linking up to demand a greater say in how to manage public land and protect the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What it comes down to is our cultural history, and the land that we've been handed down by our ancestors to take care of,&quot; said one leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">___</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Two studies published in the science journal Nature show how the surface of Pluto might have been scarred long ago when a smaller body slammed into it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research was spurred by images captured by a NASA spacecraft last year that showed a bright heart-shaped splotch on Pluto's surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Despite what the ads say, the overwhelming majority of deals on the day after Thanksgiving are duds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sales are mainly used by retailers to clear out unwanted goods. The best-selling products rarely drop much in price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We teamed up again with The Wirecutter, a website for product recommendations that was recently acquired by The New York Times, to weed out the good deals from the bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. So many tourists are visiting Iceland that the locals are expected to be outnumbered by seven to one next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two very unlikely events made it a red-hot travel destination: The currency collapse after the 2008 recession made it cheap, and a volcanic explosion two years later put it on the map.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(It's also famous for its horses; some rich visitors even buy them.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Iceland has been saved by the crash and the eruption,&quot; said one resort owner. &quot;I have never seen anything take off so fast.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Finally, we've been talking a lot about how to get ready for Thanksgiving. Mostly it's been recipes. But you may also be preparing for political arguments with friends or relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are some tips on how to argue better: listen, don't nitpick, and try to understand opposing points of view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't think of an argument as an opportunity to convince the other person of your view; think of it as a way to test and improve your opinions.</SPAN></P>
