<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investment pitch for a new Texas hotel uses Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name and has professional-sounding bona fides. Focusing on the well-heeled Chinese, the deal promotes the ''excellent location'' of the $130 million Austin Mirabeau </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotel and ''the world's leading developer,'' the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project offers another enticement: a path to a green card in the United States. Chinese investors who put at least $500,000 into the hotel could get a visa as part of a government program intended to tap overseas money and create jobs in economically troubled American neighborhoods. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On its surface, the pitch, detailed in a 16-page document distributed to Chinese investors in recent weeks, appears to be another example of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> conflicting views on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and trade. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Republican presidential candidate, has accused the country of stealing American jobs even though he has used its manufacturers for his line of clothing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a closer look exposes the potential troubles with the controversial American visa initiative, called the EB-5 program, which has been marred by cases of fraud and doubts that it produces the desired economic results. The Austin project hasn't been officially greenlighted, and there is little sign that either Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or his organization is deeply involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The company named as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization's partner has zero value, according to the personal bankruptcy filing of its chief executive. And property records show a project with a different name, Waterloo Park Tower, is in the works for the site in Austin, which at the moment is home to a brick-oven pizzeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-linked project has tapped EB-5 money from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the past, according to a Bloomberg article published in March that looked at a tower in Jersey City, N.J. While a spokeswoman for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels didn't outright deny any </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> involvement in the Austin project, she played down the organization's connection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Our growth strategy is to expand the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels portfolio by strategically developing and opening properties in both key U.S. and international locations,'' said the spokeswoman, Jennifer Rodstrom. ''While we do not have a definite project in Austin at this time, we remain interested in key U.S. cities and will continue to explore such opportunities accordingly.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As American lawmakers consider renewing the EB-5 program, it faces criticism about how it has been managed. Regulators say the program has been used to swindle overseas investors, including those from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One California couple raised $27 million from Chinese investors through the EB-5 program for cancer treatment centers that never got built, according to American securities regulators. In another case, two California residents raised about $20 million in Chinese money to build nursing care facilities but instead used investor funds for personal needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''U.S. investors and foreign nationals are being duped and left high and dry,'' Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said at a February hearing about the program, adding that government officials will intensify scrutiny of EB-5 applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, much of the individual vetting is left to investors and to businesses that advise them on potential EB-5 programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Because I haven't officially started promoting this project, I'm still in the process of investigating it, so I can't say that I'm worried,'' said Dong Xiaolin, head of Dacheng Education Group, a company in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> northern province of Hebei that helps students find schools abroad, a process that can also involve trying to navigate the visa options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Dong said she planned to travel to Austin at the end of the year to evaluate it, and said she was not concerned when she heard details of the project. ''The United States is a country that has rule of law, and is very rigorous in terms of these things,'' Ms. Dong said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent days, a job posting on the website of The Beijinger, an English-language Beijing magazine, said it was looking for ''a white American'' to run an EB-5 center to raise funds for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hotel in Austin. Many Chinese people believe that having a Caucasian person front a project gives it an air of prestige or veneer of credibility, giving rise to ''rent a white face'' businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For many wealthy Chinese individuals, a green card is a ticket out of a country that is struggling with heavy air pollution, a rigid education system and an increasingly authoritarian political environment. The sweeping anti-corruption campaign by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has also rattled many rich businessmen and women, prompting them to look for ways to send their money abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The proposed 33-story Mirabeau </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hotel would seem to put their money a world away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to an EB-5 fund-raising document, the $130 million hotel -- at an address just blocks away from the Texas Capitol building -- will offer 277 high-end rooms to business travelers as well as vacationers hoping to hit Austin's Sixth Street party district. The project would use the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name and be operated by his firm. Its developers are seeking $40 million in funding from EB-5 investors, according to the document, which says construction will begin in the fourth quarter of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The investment effort, the materials indicate, is being led by Kevin Rogers, an EB-5 fund-raiser in Dallas. The pitch cites his past projects for a Dallas call center, a Houston apartment complex and an International House of Pancakes restaurant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The pitch shows Mr. Rogers posing with George W. Bush, the former president. In a letter included as part of the pitch, Mr. Rogers writes, ''I look forward to meeting you and helping you realize your dreams.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rogers said, in an email, that he did not authorize any advertising for ''a white American'' for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> project. He did not respond to additional emails and phone calls for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The document says Mr. Rogers is raising money for Global Management Resources L.L.C., or G.M.R., a developer that it says it is working with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization on the hotel. G.M.R. has a 30-year history of developing hotels and built and sold two over the last two years, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  G.M.R.'s records show its chief executive is Brett Norwich, a serial entrepreneur who invests in real estate in Texas and elsewhere. Mr. Norwich did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In September, Mr. Norwich filed for personal bankruptcy protection in Chicago, listing more than $11 million in business-related debt. The filing said that G.M.R. had no assets of value and that his projects had failed over the last two years. ''He is working on other projects but does not know when he will have income,'' the bankruptcy filing says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a video on YouTube and on his website, Mr. Rogers said his firm watched out for fraud and played by the rules. Fraudsters, he said in the video, don't last long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A developer who wants to defraud someone can ''make up something wild and crazy'' and get away with it if the EB-5 fund-raiser doesn't do enough due diligence, he says. ''But you won't get away with it long. Because it fails.''</SPAN></P>
