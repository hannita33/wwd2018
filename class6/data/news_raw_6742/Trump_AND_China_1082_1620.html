</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Kerry, the outgoing U.S. Secretary of State, dropped the diplomatic niceties and used one of his last speeches to rebuke Israel, warning that the government was undermining any hope of a two-state solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kerry spoke knowing that the incoming administration of President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may well abandon decades of American policy toward Israel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours earlier, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had posted on Twitter that the Obama administration had treated its ally in the Middle East with &quot;total disdain and disrespect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> blouse made in Indonesia. A jacket from Vietnam. A leather bootee manufactured in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All were on sale at Saks Off Fifth in New York recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower, a cap made in Bangladesh was on sale for $35.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promise to impose high tariffs on companies that don't move production to the U.S. could take aim at his own brand, and his daughter's as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pick for energy secretary, the former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, is confirmed, he will oversee a department that runs the nation's nuclear weapons labs. He will also most likely be pressedto resume the testing of nuclear weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some experts fear that testing the U.S. arsenal for the first time since 1992 would risk an arms race. Others wonder if the weapons still work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Debbie Reynolds, the Hollywood star best known for the 1952 musical &quot;Singin' in the Rain,&quot; died at 84, a day after the death of her daughter, the actress Carrie Fisher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's now with Carrie and we're all heartbroken,&quot; her son said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of Russians diagnosed with H.I.V. passed the one million mark this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some officials deny that the country is experiencing an &quot;epidemic.&quot; But others estimate that 500,000 cases are undiagnosed, in addition to the 850,000 people known to be infected and the 220,000 who have died since the late 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chief of Dentsu, Japan's largest advertising agency, said he would resign to take responsibility for the suicide of an employee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a case that laid bare dangerously long work hours at the agency, labor officials ruled that the underlying cause of the employee's death was overwork.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Qualcomm, the California-based chip maker, will appeal a South Korean regulator's $854 million fine for unfair business practices, including denying access to technology patents for its rivals in Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Above, Shin Young-sun, the secretary-general of the Korea Fair Trade Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year was the biggest in terms of the sudden undoing of major deals - transactions that were withdrawn after being announced - since the depths of the financial crisis eight years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The world's richest people ended 2016 with more than $237 billion more than they had at the start. The gains were led by Warren Buffett, the investor, who added $11.8 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clean tech companies - organizations that hope to overturn polluting industries with solutions that do not damage the environment - are aiming for a comeback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And here are some tips to improve the maintenance of your passwords, devices and tech infrastructure. Also, ways to be a wiser shopper and reduce waste in 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wall Street was lower. Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sydney banned alcohol at a popular beach for the rest of the Australian summer after a Christmas Day party there drew more than 10,000 people who left 16 tons of trash. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ruling party in the southern Indian state Tamil Nadu will meet to select a new general secretary. Jayalalithaa Jayaraman, the powerful politician who held the post for decades, died on Dec. 5. [The Times of India]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Australian police exposed a major cocaine ring working out of the Sydney Fish Market. The drug was being moved from Chile to Australia in fish trawlers, officials said. [News.com.au]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> German officials detained a 40-year-old Tunisian man as a possible accomplice of Anis Amri, the man who carried out the truck attack in Berlin that killed 12 people. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In India, an increasingly long wait to adopt was linked to a rise in human trafficking, with two baby selling rackets busted recently, officials said. [Reuters]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Japanese intelligence agency said Chinese universities and think tanks are forming ties with Okinawan independence groups in an effort to divide public opinion. [Bloomberg]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial and imprisonment of a Marine Corps veteran underscore the struggles that many combat soldiers face when they return to the U.S. carrying the scars of war. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Cambodia, the sighting of 10 new dolphin calves raised hope for the future of the critically endangered Irrawaddy dolphins of the Mekong River. [The Phnom Penh Post]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A study in the Great Barrier Reef showed that certain fish larvae appear to use the Earth's magnetic forces to guide them back to where they were born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our daily 360 video takes viewers on a ride in the Flying Scotsman, a beloved British steam engine that was recently renovated and brought out of retirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women who took fish oil during the last three months of pregnancy significantly lowered the risk that their children would develop asthma, a new study found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case you missed it, this year a bit of music history was made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen&quot; song by the Japanese comedian Kazuhito Kosaka - he is better known by his stage name Pikotaro - went from YouTube to a spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. At 45 seconds, it's the shortest song ever to appear on the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the video has been watched more than 100 million times since its release this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The song's lyrics, while not likely to win the artist a Nobel Prize in Literature, proved to be catchy: &quot;I have a pen, I have a apple. Uh! Apple pen!&quot; Many imitations have appeared online over the last months, including one by late night host Stephen Colbert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there is one thing I need to say: There is someone who in one of the videos actually stabs an apple with a pen,&quot; he said. &quot;That's a waste.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kosaka is relishing his newfound popularity, but he's wary of becoming just a one-hit wonder. He's said he is working on new music, including one about citrus fruits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Boehler contributed reporting.</SPAN></P>
