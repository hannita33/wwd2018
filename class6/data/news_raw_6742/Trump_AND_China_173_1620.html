<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The U.S. president-elect's lack of strategic coherence about East Asia is an opportunity for Japan to help shape America's policies toward the region.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TOKYO - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan is making an urgent trip to New York this week to meet with the American president-elect, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The government in Tokyo is on high alert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency could be the greatest challenge to U.S.-Japan relations since the end of World War II - at least if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intends to translate his campaign pledges into actual foreign policy. On the stump, he challenged the main tenets of the two countries' security relations, as well as America's approach to nuclear deterrence in the Asia-Pacific region and to multilateral trade agreements. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has cast unprecedented uncertainty on a partnership that has served Japan and America - and the rest of the world - in good stead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S.-Japan alliance has been a cornerstone of stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region for decades. Under the Abe administration, the Japanese government is both more stable and more nimble today than it has been in years. Even before the U.S. election, Mr. Abe had signaled his government's resolve to see Japan take on a greater leadership role.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet throughout the campaign, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> complained that U.S.-Japan relations were one-sided, with America shouldering too many of the burdens. He accused Japan, the world's third-largest economy, of being a free-rider. Japan would have to step up, he said, or it would be left to its own devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These charges were off the mark. Every year the Japanese government covers around 75 percent of the costs of maintaining U.S. military bases in Japan, far more than the share that South Korea and Germany bear for America's military presence in those countries. The Abe administration has also taken significant, and unpopular, steps to expand Japan's defense capability. In 2015, it passed security bills that, among other things, authorized the Japanese military to engage in combat missions overseas. Japan also agreed to new defense-cooperation guidelines with the U.S. government that expanded Japan's role in, for example, enforcing maritime law in the East </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than lambasting Japan for not doing enough, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should recognize its recent efforts. That would stand a better chance of encouraging Tokyo to contribute even more in areas where it can, such as by cooperating with the United States on developing cutting-edge defense technology or increasing Japan's civilian coast-guard capacity-building in Southeast Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must also reaffirm America's commitment to maintaining the so-called nuclear umbrella over Japan and South Korea, its guarantee to defend its non-nuclear allies if they come under attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even while acknowledging that the volatile leadership of North Korea is a major security threat, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has suggested that Japan and South Korea should develop their own nuclear deterrent. This caused alarm in Japan, prompting the government to declare again that the country will never possess nuclear weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a recent Gallup poll, however, 58 percent of the population of South Korea is in favor of arming the country with nuclear weapons. This is an ominous indicator. In order to stem any risk of nuclear proliferation in East Asia, the U.S. government must reaffirm that it will stick by its longstanding nuclear policy in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another major plank of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign platform was his opposition to globalization and multilateral trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (T.P.P.). He said he favored bilateral arrangements instead. Promising to protect manufacturing jobs for Americans, he also said he would seek to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory, Japan's House of Representatives ratified the T.P.P. Mr. Abe has said that the deal would not only bring economic benefits but also have &quot;awesome&quot; strategic value: It would indeed confirm the enduring relevance of the rules-based liberal international order that has helped maintain peace since World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the T.P.P. isn't it, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will realize soon enough that, for both economic and strategic reasons, America must participate in multilateral trade agreements in the Asia-Pacific region. Otherwise, it will be left out, in effect ceding the area to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and its economic expansionism - and undermining Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stated resolve to adopt a tougher stance toward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on trade issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vision lacks strategic coherence - yet this is also an opportunity for Japan to help shape America's policies in East Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Japanese and U.S. governments struggled to forge a common approach to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> under the Obama administration, with Washington wavering between wanting a &quot;special relationship&quot; with Beijing and pushing back against it, especially its aggressive claims over islands in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. Tokyo, on the other hand, has been unequivocal in its view that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a great threat to the continuing development of a rules-based order in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bridging this perception gap should be at the top of Mr. Abe's list of issues to address with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He could, for example, propose the &quot;isosceles triangle&quot; model touted by Lee Kuan Yew, the late prime minister of Singapore, as a framework for their discussions. Mr. Lee promoted a set of relations among America, Japan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that connected the three countries, but with America and Japan at the two closer corners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Abe and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would also do well to explore new areas of cooperation, such as with Moscow. Although Russia may seem like a disruptive power from the vantage point of the West, it could be an agent of stability in the Asia-Pacific region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he is confident that he can &quot;get along&quot; with strongmen like Vladimir V. Putin. George W. Bush had claimed the same, and failed. Mr. Abe, however, has met Mr. Putin more than a dozen times and has built a reliable constructive relationship with him. Working through Tokyo, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could seek to improve U.S.-Russia ties and encourage Moscow's cooperation on issues of mutual interest, such as security on the Korean Peninsula, at the same time forestalling further rapprochement between Moscow and Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S.-Japan relationship is one of the most successful great-power alliances in recent history, and President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must not allow the incoherences of his campaign-trail bluster to undermine it. If anything, he should take up Mr. Abe on his own commitment to bolster Japan's leadership in the Asia-Pacific region in order to further strengthen ties between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
