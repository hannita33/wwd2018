<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''Kindling Talk of an Arms Race With a Vow to 'Outlast Them All' '' (front page, Dec. 24): </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Will someone explain to President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has threatened to ''outmatch'' rivals in a new nuclear arms race, that one cannot ''win'' such a race? That even the ''losers'' in the race accumulate nuclear weapons sufficient to end civilization as we know it, and that therefore the measure of an American president's success in nuclear strategy is his ability to discourage such races from occurring in the first place?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To encourage a global nuclear arms race is simply to multiply the nations that pose an existential threat to the United States, dramatically decreasing American national security. This is an elementary point of American nuclear strategy, accepted by all recent presidents. One very much hopes that there are level heads around the president-elect with the wherewithal to explain it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Re ''Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Flirts With an Arms Race'' (editorial, Dec. 24):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I am going to do something I never thought I would and defend President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on this one, as some Americans are tone deaf to the code in his comments that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> voters seem to understand. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aggressive response to a comment from President Vladimir Putin about increasing Russia's nuclear capability was almost certainly designed to avoid an arms race, not start one.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both political parties and the courts should cooperate to keep from office (or remove from office) a president-elect whose mind, emotions and behavior endanger national and global security. The grounds could relate to his taxes, his foundation, his university, conflicts of interest or the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution. He would command a superpower but, with no experience in government or world politics, he shuns intelligence briefings and dismisses the accumulated wisdom of Foreign Service professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His defenders may say that breaking with precedent, as on ''one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' does not create a clear and present danger. Nor does flirting with Russia or -- in the opposite direction -- acquiring more nukes. But the man's temperament could lead him to impetuous acts that trigger a nuclear war, initiated by the United States or by one of its adversaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, steps should be taken to create a firewall to prevent any president from launching a nuclear weapon without a mechanism for consultation with appropriate authorities. The danger is not that deterrence will fail but that passions may overwhelm rationality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pledge on nuclear arms to ''outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all'' has struck listeners not so much as a policy statement as a reflexive expression of national machismo. It seems that to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, everything is a competition, and if he's not the winner, he's a loser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With that attitude, it will be all too easy for international leaders to bluff him into risky, expensive actions that waste America's resources without serving our interests. Is Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> falling into the same sort of trap that Ronald Reagan laid for Vladimir Putin's predecessors in the old Soviet Union, egged down the path to ruinous competition for a pointless prize? Is Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> America going to be bamboozled into bankruptcy?  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Each time Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has tweeted about nuclear weapons, I have had a terrible, familiar feeling: the anxiety I experienced as a child in the 1950s, thinking that the world could end in a moment. That children would have to live with that again is horrifying to me.</SPAN></P>
