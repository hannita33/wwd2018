</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic policy speech - well, &quot;policy&quot; speech - it seems time to brush up on trade and jobs, an issue I used to write a lot about. The big story in the academia/policy space lately has been the work of Autor et al, who in twopapers have estimated large losses from Chinese import penetration. I basically agree with this conclusion, at least when we're talking about manufacturing employment. But I'm troubled by some conceptual issues, which I think are important for interpreting the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe the best way to explain all of this is to start by talking about how I would do this - in fact, the way I've been doing it on the backs of various envelopes over the years. I would begin by posing a counterfactual: what would U.S. employment look like if we had pursued policies such as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tariffs that prevented the large trade deficits in manufacturing we actually have?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd start by arguing that a balanced expansion of imports and imports would have, to a first approximation, no effect on manufacturing value added, and an effect on employment only to the extent that import-competing industry is more labor-intensive than exports. Leave that on one side. Then what matters is the manufacturing trade deficit, which according to the WTO was approximately $600 billion in 2014.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much manufacturing did that deficit displace? It doesn't all come out of manufacturing value added, because a fair bit of a dollar spent on manufactured goods eventually shows up in purchases of non-manufactured imports. I need to do this more carefully (on deadline right now), but a rough number would be 60 percent for manufactured content; so we're talking about $360 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, employment: value added per worker in manufacturing is approximately $175,000. So this should translate into a bit over 2 million jobs. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK, what about the effect on overall employment? In general, you can't answer that with a similar computation, because it all depends on offsetting policies. If monetary and fiscal policy are used to achieve a target level of employment - as they generally were prior to the 2008 crisis - then a first cut at the impact on overall employment is zero. That is, trade deficits meant 2 million fewer manufacturing jobs and 2 million more in the service sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 2008, of course, we've been in a liquidity trap, with the Fed either unable or unwilling to hit its targets and fiscal policy paralyzed by ideology, so trade deficits are in practice a major drag on overall employment. But this is a bit different from the usual &quot;trade costs jobs&quot; argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, how big a deal is displacement of 2 million manufacturing jobs? Not trivial, to say the least. But if you want to place it in the context of deindustrialization: we're talking about 1.5 percent of the work force. So absent the trade deficit - that is, again, imagining some policy that prevents deficits from emerging - we would have roughly 11.5 percent of the work force in manufacturing, rather than the actual 10. Compare this with the realities of the past: more than 20 percent in manufacturing in the late 1970s, more than 25 percent in the 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OK, now for Autor and various co-authors, who do something very different: a bottom-up approach. They start with an empirical analysis, using cross-section data, of the impact of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shock on employment, wages, and so on at the regional level - which is perfectly fine, and in fact beautiful work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what they do next is to apply the implied coefficient from this analysis to the aggregate effects of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shock. And that's much more dubious - especially when, in the second paper, they purport to estimate the effects on overall employment. In general, you can't do that: applying estimates of partial regional effects to the overall aggregate exposes you to huge possible fallacies of composition. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in this case the crucial issue is monetary and fiscal response. Up through 2007 we basically had a Fed which raised rates whenever it thought the economy was overheating; in the absence of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shock it would have raised rates sooner and faster, so you just can't use the results of the cross-section regression - which doesn't reflect monetary policy, which was the same for everyone - to predict how things would have turned out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, it so happens that my alternative procedure yields results for manufacturing alone that aren't too much out of line with those papers. But this should be seen as jobs shifted out of manufacturing to other sectors, not total job loss, at least pre-crisis.</SPAN></P>
