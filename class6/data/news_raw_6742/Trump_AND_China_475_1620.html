</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''The irony is that after 20 months of watching and listening to Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> every day in the news, we now face this moment where it feels like we are staring into kind of a black hole.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was Evan Osnos, a correspondent for The New Yorker, describing how difficult it &iacute;s to anticipate what Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency might look like, given how unconventional his campaign was. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For a recent article, published before the election, Mr. Osnos spoke to more than 50 experts in an attempt to understand the actions that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could take in his first term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a phone interview on Wednesday, Mr. Osnos detailed some of his conclusions. We supplemented his reporting with our own to try to anticipate what Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is likely to do once he takes office.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Osnos said that taking Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign promises seriously makes more sense than the alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are two options to how you want to anticipate and prepare for a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency,'' he said. ''One is to declare that nothing he says is useful and reliable, and we should do nothing. The other is to invest heavily in trying to understand what the history of the presidency tells us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Even if a president doesn't intend to follow through on a promise,'' he continued, ''the nature of the presidency compels him to make a good-faith effort to do so because his credibility once in office rests partly on whether he is showing a serious commitment to follow through on the things he does.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Are U.S. military alliances in trouble? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In July, the night before he accepted the Republican nomination for president, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke about America's commitment to its NATO allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the Baltic States -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- were to be attacked by Russia, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, he would review whether those nations had ''fulfilled their obligations to us'' before deciding whether to come to their aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The New York Times reporters David E. Sanger and Maggie Haberman wrote at the time that ''Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> statement appeared to be the first time that a major candidate for president had suggested conditioning the United States' defense of its major allies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Osnos pointed out that even making statements along the lines of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments in July could make for troubled alliances, because ''the strength of NATO is built on the notion of credibility.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's a little bit like talking about whether you're going to repay your debt,'' he said. ''Even talking about it in language that departs from 70 years of American national security strategy can have the effect of altering it in fact.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Will women have to pay for birth control again?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With a Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be empowered to do what he and his party have long promised: repeal the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's signature domestic legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In late October, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repeated his dislike for the law and said, ''Repealing Obamacare and stopping Hillary's health care takeover is one of the single most important reasons that we must win on Nov. 8.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The health care law gave 47 million women access to preventive health services. It also required insurers to make birth control available at no cost to women, eliminating costly co-payments that in many cases ran to hundreds of dollars a year or more. After Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> win on Tuesday, women on social media announced plans to obtain intrauterine devices, a form of contraception that can last as long as 12 years but that was prohibitively expensive for many before Obamacare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Margot Sanger-Katz, writing for the Upshot, said that repealing the law would mean that ''about 22 million fewer Americans would have health insurance, according to an estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, on Friday, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that he might be willing to leave parts of the law in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Will he deport more undocumented immigrants?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Times's immigration correspondent, Julia Preston, put together a comprehensive look at Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans on immigration: ''Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he will initiate a campaign to deport, within the first year of his presidency, what he described as up to two million undocumented immigrants with criminal records,'' she wrote, ''although he has not explained how he reached that estimate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Immigration is ''one area on which a president has a lot more power and legal authority than I think your average American assumes,'' Mr. Osnos said. ''He could accomplish a lot of the goals he has, even with the resistance of the courts and Congress, by using the powers of the executive. On immigration, we're in a brand-new era where he has both the will and the legal authority to rewrite the rules in ways that I think most people would have found hard to imagine.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Will the Paris climate agreement stand?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has called human-caused climate change a ''hoax'' and has said he will ''cancel'' the Paris climate agreement, the landmark 2015 deal under which 195 nations agreed to take steps to lower their greenhouse gas emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Coral Davenport, a Times reporter, writes that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''can, as president, choose not to carry out the Paris plan in the United States,'' an action that ''could doom the Paris agreement's goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions enough to stave off an atmospheric warming of at least 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Furthermore, if the United States were to withdraw from the Paris accord, Ms. Davenport writes, ''other governments are less likely to carry out their pledged emissions cuts.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What will happen to U.S. trade agreements?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the first presidential debate, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> criticized Hillary Clinton for changing her stance on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an accord between the United States and 11 Pacific Rim nations that, in the end, both candidates opposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the debate, he also generally condemned America's position on trade over the last several decades, and he called the North American Free Trade Agreement, which President Bill Clinton had navigated through Congress, ''the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Osnos said that the future looked bleak for both of those deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think the TPP is dead,'' he said. ''I think he will follow through on his way to renegotiate Nafta in some way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also said he thought that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might seriously consider withdrawing the United States from the World Trade Organization, and that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might threaten sanctions against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> citing conversations with the president-elect's advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They have said to me in multiple moments that an earnest threat delivered with the kind of credibility that a President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would carry would, in their view, force the Chinese to change their nature,'' Mr. Osnos said.</SPAN></P>
