<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN JOSE, Calif. -- It was a fleeting confrontation between two strangers that might have otherwise been forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the tussle over a Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign sign after a June rally in San Jose, Calif., has already sent one man, Anthony McBride, to jail for six days, and left another, Steven Tong, lamenting the loss of civility in our democracy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The rally where these two lives collided by happenstance erupted into one of the most violent episodes of this contentious presidential election. Video footage of protesters punching, egging and tackling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters went viral, sparking outrage among Republicans and soul-searching among Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Today, the clashes between ordinary people like Mr. McBride and Mr. Tong are playing out in the California courts, in a series of criminal prosecutions brought about as Republican officials accused a city led by Democrats of failing to protect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters at the rally.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The San Jose rally and its aftermath may be the most powerful illustrations of the dangerous polarization that has gripped the country during the 2016 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a closer look at Mr. Tong, one of rally's 24 victims, and Mr. McBride, one of 22 people charged with crimes after the event, suggests that there is much that the two men share. The economic struggles and personal dreams that guided them that day are not so different, after all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On June 2, Mr. Tong woke up in his parents' house, where he has lived for the past three years, ever since he found himself unable to afford a place of his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He is 46, an age he does not like saying out loud because it reminds him how far he is from where he had hoped to be. He had dreamed of becoming a product designer and starting his own company. But art school was too expensive and he left after a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Companies like Facebook and these so-called social networking companies here in Silicon Valley became the economy,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If your occupation is in anything other than that,'' he added, ''there are not a whole lot of jobs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Tong's faith in the American Dream has been shaken. But that day, he had a ticket to see Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> speak about making America great again. Despite the sweltering heat, Mr. Tong parked in the garage at the San Jose Convention Center and walked a few blocks to the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That same morning, Anthony McBride, who is anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> woke up in his friend's mother's apartment, where he has lived for the past three years, ever since he found himself unable to afford a place of his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He is 21, too young to carry the stain of life's disappointments. He dreams of being a fashion designer and starting his own company. But art school is too expensive. He works two jobs -- at a car dealership and a clothing store -- to save for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also designs shirts that read ''BE YRSLF.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He hopes they will inspire ''a movement where people are just being themselves and are not following trends or what society says they have to be,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. McBride's faith in the American Dream remains intact, but it is marred by the bigotry that he sees as a product of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign. On the morning of the rally, Mr. McBride put on a ''BE YRSLF'' T-shirt and boarded the light rail to the convention center, eager to see for himself what a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> event was really like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steven Tong</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It was hot that day,'' Mr. Tong recalled. ''I was still debating whether or not I wanted to go, and I just kind of thought, 'Oh, I got to show my support.'''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the convention hall, Mr. Tong delighted in the diverse makeup of the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I was really surprised,'' he said. A rally he had attended earlier in the spring in Southern California, he said, ''was mostly Caucasian and middle-aged.'' But in San Jose, a city that is about 30 percent Asian and 30 percent Hispanic, more minorities turned out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Outside the hall, beyond the police barricades, protesters waved signs demanding socialism. Young men handed out the Revolutionary Communist Party's newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like many Asians in San Jose, Mr. Tong was born in Vietnam. He was 4 when Communists captured Saigon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His family had three strikes against it: His father had worked with the United States military. His grandfather had an import-export business. And they hailed from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a country that once colonized Vietnam. Officials forced Mr. Tong's family to move to a remote hut with a dirt floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Communist philosophy was, 'If you are a teacher, a professor, an intellectual, wealthy, then we are going to make you suffer,''' Mr. Tong said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When he was 9, his family made it to California. Like others who had fled Vietnam, they embraced the Republican Party's strong anticommunism stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Tong considers himself a moderate. During the booming 1990s, he once cast a ballot for Bill Clinton. He says he does not agree with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remarks about immigrants and Mexicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Mr. Tong feels anxious about the racial unrest flaring up across the country. Like many </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters, he blames President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He seems more polarizing,'' Mr. Tong said of Mr. Obama. ''He stirs people up.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Tong once felt boundless optimism about the United States. His parents, who worked entry-level jobs in electronics, had been able to buy a three-bedroom home in a well-off San Jose suburb. But now Mr. Tong cannot afford to rent -- let alone buy -- a home of his own. He was drawn to the June rally by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promise to make America as strong as it was when Mr. Tong arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took the stage and declared, ''We have a country that's not working anymore.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We have a chance to be greater than ever before,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Tong left the rally clutching a sign: ''The silent majority stands with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He meandered back to his car, chatting with a teenager from Mexico who held a sign opposing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. They joked about trading signs. Nothing seemed threatening or out of the ordinary. But when Mr. Tong reached the parking garage, he witnessed something shocking: protesters trying to steal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hats off the heads of an older Hispanic couple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I said, 'Come on, guys,''' Mr. Tong recalled. ''That's when the crowd started turning on me. Everything went out of control really quickly.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added: ''At that moment, I felt the whole crowd surrounding me. You're fearing for your life.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Tong ran into the garage. He noticed a tall black man coming behind him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anthony McBride</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It was a Tuesday, my day off,'' Mr. McBride recalled. ''I slept in, watched some TV.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While checking Twitter, he noticed that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was coming to town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. McBride hoped to get into the rally ''to go experience what he says for myself,'' he said. But a wall of police officers blocked the entrance. So he drifted to the ''free speech'' area, where protesters -- including some friends from Oak Grove, where he had gone to high school -- gathered. Mr. McBride had fond memories of Oak Grove, even though he was asked to leave it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his senior year, he had attended a basketball game against a suburban school from a more affluent community. Rival fans chanted that Oak Grove students were on welfare. Mr. McBride said he and his friends responded with their own chant, ''We drive sober'' -- a painful reference to a drunken-driving death the rival school had recently suffered. Afterward, Mr. McBride said, school authorities asked him to finish his credits with independent study. (The school's principal declined to comment.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the time, Mr. McBride lived with his aunt, who told him he had to be in school to stay with her. He ended up on the couch in the apartment of his best friend's mother. Three years later, he is still there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. McBride considers himself a moderate. He opposes amnesty for undocumented immigrants. He believes that the entrepreneurial spirit should be rewarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it is racism -- not government regulation of the economy -- that worries him. The son of an African-American father and an Irish mother he has not seen since he was 4, Mr. McBride blames the recent racial unrest on injustice, not Democratic politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''People are just frustrated,'' he said. ''With police brutality. With feeling not equal to white people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To Mr. McBride's generation, the spate of high-profile police killings of black people shows the limits of politics and the need for activism. Protests -- not the election of a black president -- have brought a modicum of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Encounter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Joining the gathering crowd outside the convention center, Mr. McBride felt he had justice on his side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At first, he said, it felt like a carnival outside the arena. People danced to Mexican music. Street vendors sold watermelon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But then the rally inside ended. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters poured out. Protesters chanted obscenities at them. They hurled insults back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A blonde woman named Rachel Casey, who was wearing a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shirt, filmed herself sticking her middle finger up at the crowd. Protesters traded insults with her as she drifted past the police barricades to the Marriott Hotel next door. Protesters surrounded her in the doorway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then someone threw a piece of watermelon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I was in the front, just clapping,'' Mr. McBride said. ''Someone in the back started throwing eggs. One of them hit me. I was like, 'Wow, who brought eggs?'''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A hotel security guard opened the door and Ms. Casey slipped inside. The crowd marched on. A black female protester burning an American flag got into a shoving match with a white female </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporter. A white teenager got scared and started running. A black teenager tackled him. A first-generation Mexican who opposes Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> punched in the nose a third-generation Mexican who supports the candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The police later traced the most violent run-ins to ''local gangsters'' with long criminal records, according to Sgt. Brian Anderson, who headed the San Jose police team that pored over thousands of hours of videos from the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some Oak Grove High School students were also charged. ''Several of them were good students and athletes, but they decided to forget their upbringing,'' Sergeant Anderson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. McBride might have fit into in that category. He was an athlete, but he said his father, who works at a warehouse, allowed him to play sports only if he got good grades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. McBride admits that he got angry that day at the rally. He says </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters mistook him for Mexican and shouted insults at him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I heard, 'Go back to your country, wetback,''' he said. He started taking every </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sign he saw and ripping it in half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He followed a wave of protesters into a parking garage. That's where he spotted an Asian man with a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I was kind of disappointed in him,'' Mr. McBride recalled. ''He's a minority, and I didn't see why he's supporting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. McBride snatched Mr. Tong's sign. Mr. Tong grabbed it back. For a split second, they held it together, in a tug of war. Mr. McBride could see the fear in Mr. Tong's eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Months later, Mr. Tong looked back at the encounter and wondered about Mr. McBride. Was he a college student?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He didn't seem like a gangster,'' Mr. Tong recalled. ''There are protesters who are just upset, and I think if I was in their position, I'd be upset, too. But no protester -- no matter how angry they are -- can break things and harass people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Maybe because of the stress of what happened to him at the rally, Mr. Tong dreams of escaping on Election Day. He thinks about camping in Death Valley on Nov. 8 just so he can get away from the news. But sometimes he has the opposite desire. He wants to visit an old friend -- a black man he met in a long-ago photography class -- so they can have political debates about Mr. Obama that he keeps bottled up inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, Mr. McBride thinks back on that moment and regrets being the source of Mr. Tong's fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'd probably have been afraid, too,'' Mr. McBride said. ''I didn't agree with any of the fighting.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But two weeks after the rally, police officers showed up at Mr. McBride's job at the mall and asked him to answer some questions. Mr. McBride, who has no criminal record, cooperated. He did not ask for a lawyer. ''I wasn't scared because I didn't do anything,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said he told them everything he could remember. Afterward, he expected to be allowed to go home. Instead, they handcuffed him and took him to jail, where he remained for six days, accused of vandalism, battery and the attempted theft of Mr. Tong's sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On a recent Wednesday, Mr. McBride sat in court on a row of benches filled with black and Hispanic men, nearly all of them represented by a single public defender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''McBride? You're our </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> guy, right?'' she asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She explained that because of what he had told the police about the confrontation outside the rally, prosecutors were adding a new charge: the false imprisonment of Ms. Casey, who had been egged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We'll try to get it down to 'disturbing the peace,''' she said. ''I don't know if we're going to get there, but that's our goal.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now Mr. McBride, who cannot afford a lawyer, is not sure if he should plead guilty to a crime he doesn't feel he committed, or fight the charges. He thinks about that moment when he grabbed Mr. Tong's sign, and about what made him let it go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I realized it was stupid,'' he recalled. ''If it was on a different street, at a different time, I probably would have just talked to him about why he was supporting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But it was not a regular day.''</SPAN></P>
