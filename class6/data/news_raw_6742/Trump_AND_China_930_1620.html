<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Altaba'' -- that's the new name of the company that remains if Yahoo completes the sale of its internet business to Verizon (not to be confused with the scissors maker in Pakistan), according to a regulatory filing on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The name is a play on Alibaba, which Altaba holds a 15 percent stake in. It also holds a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Marissa Mayer, the chief executive, would step down from the board, along with Maynard Webb, the chairman, and David Filo, a Yahoo founder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All of this depends on whether Yahoo can close the sale to Verizon, whose executives have said they are weighing options after the disclosure of two hacking episodes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also on Monday, the founder of Alibaba, Jack Ma, met with Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the president-elect, to discuss the e-commerce company's expansion into the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Alibaba over how it reports its  operating data for Singles Day, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> annual shopping festival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alibaba has also deepened its reach into physical retail stores; the company announced that it would help Intime Retail, a department store operator, go private. Alibaba and Shen Guojun, the founder of Intime, will pay as much as $2.6 billion to take the Hong Kong-listed chain of department stores private, as The Wall Street Journal reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appointees' Taxes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Not only is Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> giving a gang of billionaires control of our government, he's offering them a special tax break just for signing up.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So said Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, when criticizing how the tax code allows government appointees to defer paying taxes on stock sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not true, says Andrew Ross Sorkin. The crucial point is that the taxes are deferred -- not eliminated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If there is a benefit, it allows executives to diversify out of their own stock. But if they want to cash out and buy a house, for example, they will pay the full tax bill. Some, like Steven T. Mnuchin, the nominee for Treasury secretary, may actually lose money on some of the assets they have to sell because their holdings are in illiquid assets, like private equity funds, that have to be offloaded at a discount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of all the potential conflicts of interest that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his cabinet picks may present, the tax treatment they receive in this instance is not one of them, Mr. Sorkin writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Quotation of the Day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What we are seeing now is, after the initial chaos of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition, that his nominees are now complying with the requirements of the law.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  -- Norman L. Eisen, former chief White House ethics lawyer under President Obama. Jared Kushner, who will become senior White House adviser to his father-in-law, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, plans to sell some of his real estate holdings and other assets. Mr. Eisen said that his decision to divest raised pressure on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Executive Trip Helps F.B.I.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is a rare feat for the F.B.I. -- arresting an overseas corporate executive accused of wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But they were able to do it on Saturday when Oliver Schmidt, an executive at Volkswagen, traveled to the United States. They swooped in on him as he prepared to leave Miami International Airport for Germany, according to law enforcement officials familiar with the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Schmidt played a central role in covering up Volkswagen's diesel emissions cheating, according to an affidavit from an F.B.I. officer that was unsealed on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The case against him sheds more doubt on Volkswagen's assertions that top executives did not understand the full scale of wrongdoing at the company until September 2015. Mr. Schmidt briefed executives in detail months earlier, in July, according to the criminal complaint, filed in federal court in Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mars Bets on Pets</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  M&amp;M's and chocolate bars may be what you think of when you hear the name Mars, but the company's business will become furrier in nature after it agreed to pay $7.7 billion for VCA, a company that owns animal hospitals and dog day care franchises that operate under the name Camp Bow Wow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  VCA will still operate as a separate business unit under Mars Petcare, which already used VCA's lab services in its veterinary businesses. Talks about a deal began after Mars approached the company in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Petcare, chocolate and Wrigley now contribute 90 percent of sales for Mars, and Petcare will become the largest business for the company, with VCA adding about $2 billion in revenue.</SPAN></P>
