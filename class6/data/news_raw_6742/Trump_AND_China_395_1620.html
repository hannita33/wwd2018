<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some debates seem to transform the fundamentals of a political campaign. The first clash between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was not one of those events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than shifting the lines of the presidential race, this debate seems likely to deepen them -- bolstering Mrs. Clinton's advantage on questions of temperament and tolerance, and amplifying Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> blustery message of drastic change. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mrs. Clinton appeared to gain in strength over the course of the debate, ultimately routing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a series of late exchanges. Here are some of our key takeaways from the night:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Clinton scored on race, gender and security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton seems to have bested Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the debate largely thanks to her mastery of three subjects that have defined her general election campaign: race, gender and national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Breaking through in an exchange on race, she battered Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for pushing what she called a ''racist lie'' that President Obama was born outside the United States. Assailing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as sexist, Mrs. Clinton quoted him calling women ''pigs, slobs and dogs.'' And in a back-and-forth on national security, she accused him repeatedly of risking ''another war'' with his hot temper, and said he could not be trusted with nuclear weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> struggled to answer the substance of Mrs. Clinton's criticism, and often appeared thrown by her attacks. His response on national security consisted largely of name-checking various global problem areas, like the Islamic State and Iran, without offering a pointed critique or alternative solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is stronger as the outsider</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an uneven and at times flailing debate performance, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had a few moments of strength: He was at his best when he was bringing the fight to Mrs. Clinton on trade policy and her status as a political insider, and delivering blunt calls for wholesale upheaval in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hammered Mrs. Clinton early on as an avatar of the status quo. ''She's been doing this for 30 years,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said repeatedly. Later, he charged: ''Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But what Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not yet done is convince most Americans that he is the right alternative to a broken political system, and it's not likely he accomplished that on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A clash of styles and personalities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He shouted, interrupted and sniffed. She kept a level tone and wielded prefab one-liners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For all the policy disputes between Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mrs. Clinton, it may be the vast difference in their personalities that leaves a deeper impression on voters. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who dodged policy details, badgered Mrs. Clinton as he did his Republican primary opponents, cutting in to mock and contest her claims. He talked over Lester Holt, the moderator -- a performance likely to reinforce his appeal to fans, but unlikely to dispatch doubts about his temperament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton was far more restrained: She declined to match Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> volume when he yelled over her, and several times pointed viewers to the internet for fact-checking purposes, rather than going after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> misstatements herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Notably, for a candidate who has strained to connect with voters on a gut level, Mrs. Clinton repeatedly invoked her father and granddaughter, in what seemed like an effort to cast her views in a more personal light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> defied the facts again</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has faced intensifying scrutiny in recent weeks for his practice of spreading incorrect or misleading information. But he was undeterred on Monday evening and again peddled false claims, including some of his most thoroughly debunked fables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his leadoff answer, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warned that Ford was planning to slash thousands of American jobs to relocate small-car production to Mexico -- a claim the company's chief executive has denied. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> insisted that he had not called global warming a hoax perpetrated by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> though he has said precisely that on Twitter. And Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repeated numerous times that he was against the war in Iraq from the start, which is plainly contrary to the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Holt, the staid NBC anchor moderating the debate, stepped in at one point to observe that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had not originally opposed the war. Perhaps surprisingly, Mrs. Clinton allowed several of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> claims to go unchallenged in their specifics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bells that didn't ring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There were a few glaring omissions from the list of issues covered in the debate -- including, remarkably, the defining issue of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Immigration did not come up even once. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> didn't raise it, and neither Mrs. Clinton nor Mr. Holt challenged him on the subject. While Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for demonizing Muslims, neither she nor anyone else mentioned a signature </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposal from the Republican primaries, to ban all Muslim immigration to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And in an oversight that would have been unthinkable for any conventional Republican candidate, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not even mention the Affordable Care Act or the word ''Obamacare,'' effectively ignoring the defining concern of the Obama-era Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
