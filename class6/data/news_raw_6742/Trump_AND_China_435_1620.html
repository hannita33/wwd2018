</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OVER the course of the past two months, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has assailed Hillary Clinton as &quot;a world-class liar,&quot; suggested that she had a role in the death of a White House aide while Bill Clinton was president, darkly referenced Mr. Clinton's marital affairs and said - in a 41-minute rip of a speech on Tuesday - that Mrs. Clinton had &quot;perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.&quot; Once again, the nation seems to be marching toward another brutally nasty presidential campaign, with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leading the parade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a year when so many staples of American politics have faltered - television advertisements, polling, big-ticket endorsements, to name a few - will the negative campaign, whether wielded by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or Mrs. Clinton, be the reliable weapon it has proved to be in presidential campaigns over the course of American history? Is there anything left to say about two candidates who are so well known and so polarizing?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton is already viewed unfavorably by 55 percent of the American public, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll released June 15. She has been in public life for a very well-examined quarter of a century. Even accounting for the Clintons' tendency to serve up the unexpected damaging revelation (no one was talking about Mrs. Clinton's emails 18 months ago), it seems fair to wonder how much could be left in the opposition research pantry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whom Mrs. Clinton hammered with a series of hard-hitting television advertisements about his temperament over the past week, is in even worse shape in that poll: 70 percent of Americans hold an unfavorable view of him. He has been pelted with damaging information. That did not stop him from sweeping aside a packed Republican field and briefly leading Mrs. Clinton in some national polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is probably just a different ballgame,&quot; said Deborah J. Brooks, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. &quot;It seems like they are at historically high levels of unfavorable ratings, and they are better known than other candidates. It makes it really hard to compare to past races.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is where he is today because he has not only embraced the negative campaign, but in many ways has rewritten the rules of how it is conducted. There is little reason to think he is about to change. His attacks are searing and personal, delivered with the humorous patter of a late-night insult comedian, more reminiscent of 19th-century Federalists denouncing Thomas Jefferson as the AntiChrist - or Confederates calling Lincoln a buffoon and a drunk - than the more conventional Barack Obama advertisement showing Mitt Romney singing an off-key &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; as headlines recounted how Mr. Romney had overseen the outsourcing of jobs to Mexico and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gone way beyond anything I've seen over the past 40 years of campaigns,&quot; said Darrell M. West of the Brookings Institution. &quot;Candidates typically worry about a backlash from going negative. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't seem to worry about a backlash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most candidates, concerned about voters turning on them for being negative, try to leave the toughest attacks to television advertisements or surrogates, such as a running mate. Not Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He has happily done them himself - in TV appearances, speeches and tweets. (That said, his anemic campaign finance report released last week suggests that he doesn't have the money to pay for advertisements.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the process, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has often barged past the boundaries of propriety and truth, and at no apparent cost, at least among his supporters. In recent years, presidential campaigns have made it a practice to release detailed documentation of the charges they make in negative advertisements or speeches: a list of votes, transcripts from interviews, legal documents. Media organizations have become increasingly rigorous in policing advertisements, calling out errors and falsehoods that could prove an unwanted embarrassment for the campaign making the accusation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has not been the case with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;You say, 'My opponent did this,' so you have to provide some evidence that they did something,&quot; said Richard R. Lau, a professor of political science at Rutgers University. &quot;But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't care what the truth is. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has gotten so much free advertising for saying outrageous things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His approach, attention-grabbing and arguably entertaining, served him well in the crowded field of a Republican primary. But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is now competing for support among a much broader electorate, and against a candidate who has far more experience in presidential campaigns - and in being the target of all kinds of attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, many analysts said, there is a strong argument that he is vulnerable to a negative campaign in a way that Mrs. Clinton is not. Opinions on Mrs. Clinton seem set in cement at this point; short of her being indicted, it's hard to imagine information that could dramatically change voters' opinions of her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may be one of the most famous people on the planet, but his life off the public stage has not received much scrutiny, as became clear with the revelations about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University, described by some of its students as a fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While people know who Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is, they do not know a lot about him,&quot; said Howard Wolfson, a Democratic consultant who worked for Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign and first presidential campaign. &quot;There is very little awareness of his business record, or other aspects of his career. I think when a story runs about the number of lawsuits he's been engaged in or the number of people he's sued or the number of people he's stiffed payment, that's new information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negative campaigning, as much as voters say they disapprove of it, tends to work. With its dark and detailed invocations of a candidate's votes and quotes, a negative campaign can provide voters with the type of information they need to make an informed choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most effective attacks portray a candidate as ideologically or culturally alien, unqualified for the job or a threat to national security or the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004, President George W. Bush lampooned his Democratic opponent, Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, with a video clip of Mr. Kerry in a wet suit that made him appear to be windsurfing back and forth across the water. It made Mr. Kerry seem slightly effete, while reinforcing a central Bush critique of Mr. Kerry's candidacy: that he was a flip-flopper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years later, during the Democratic primary in Texas, Mrs. Clinton broadcast an advertisement showing a young girl sleeping peacefully in bed as a telephone rings in the background at 3 a.m., presumably with bad news. Supporters of Mr. Obama were riled, but it raised legitimate questions about the ability of Mr. Obama, a first-term senator from Illinois, to deal with a breaking foreign crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter the obstacles, there are powerful incentives for both Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mrs. Clinton to turn to negative campaigning. The sheer volume of attacks churning the political ecosphere - on Facebook, Twitter and cable news - means it takes a lot for a candidate to break through. &quot;The news media love to cover the negativity,&quot; said John G. Geer, a professor of public policy at Vanderbilt University. &quot;And the ad people know it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with their high unfavorable ratings, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mrs. Clinton have considerable strategic motivation to go on the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COREY LEWANDOWSKI, who was Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign manager until he was forced out last week, said in an interview before his departure there was still much left to tell voters about the former secretary of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, if you remember during the first Clinton administration - when Bill was there - that was 16 years ago,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of people forget what he was like as a president, and what his policies were. Particularly new voters. And I think many people overlook what Hillary Clinton's record was like as United States senator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We haven't started,&quot; he said. &quot;I do think there is an opportunity to remind people that her career in public service goes well beyond secretary of state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joel Benenson, who is Mrs. Clinton's senior strategist, was similarly bullish on Mrs. Clinton's prospects for making the case against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Mr. Benenson said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had largely been spared during the primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They didn't take him on,&quot; Mr. Benenson said. &quot;They were running in a primary, they were competing for like-minded voters. You have to draw meaningful contrasts and they didn't do that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything he represents and that he is showing day after day is how dangerous and divisive he is and how that undermines our national security and will crash our economy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if Mrs. Clinton attacks Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on his business record - and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> finds something disconcerting in Mrs. Clinton's years in the Senate to share with voters - is that really such a bad thing? That kind of unflattering information is arguably more helpful to voters than, say, the uplifting &quot;Morning in America&quot; advertisement that helped carry Ronald Reagan to a second term in 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we make a choice, you want to know the good and bad about who you are considering,&quot; Mr. Geer said. &quot;Candidates will only tell you that they are wonderful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
