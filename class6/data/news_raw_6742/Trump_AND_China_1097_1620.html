</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Search for top cabinet post is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> formally announced today his selection of the Exxon Mobil chief executive Rex W. Tillerson for secretary of state. The decision ends weeks of speculation over the position, for which there were at least three other candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Tillerson may be headed for a difficult confirmation hearing in the Senate as bipartisan criticism grows over his stake in Russia's energy industry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for energy matters in the U.S., Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is planning to name the former TexasgovernorRick Perry to lead the Department of Energy, an agency Mr. Perry once suggested he'd like to eliminate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We look at some of the scrutiny Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> other cabinet picks may face from senators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Role of the C.I.A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recent criticism of intelligence officials and their assessment that Russia sought to influence the election in his favor echoes positions held by Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, his choice for national security adviser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Flynn has questioned the C.I.A.'s decision to kill Osama bin Laden, saying the agency could have captured the Qaeda leader instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As congressional leaders call for an investigation into possible Russian cyberattacks, we wrote a guide to separate fact from misconception about Moscow's interference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aleppo siege is ending. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forces backing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria are close to retaking the last corners of the country's largest city. At least 82 civilians were killed on Monday, the United Nations estimated, in what one official called &quot;a complete meltdown of humanity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capturing Aleppo would be a turning point in the civil war, reasserting government rule in all major cities and forcing the opposition to question whether its armed rebellion has failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inside the justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretrial diversion is an alternative to court in the U.S. intended to spare first-time or low-risk offenders the consequences of a criminal record, freeing prosecutors to pursue dangerous criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent Times investigation found that the way a prosecutor's office in Alabama uses diversion &quot;resembles a dismissal-for-sale scheme, available only to those with money and, in some cases, favor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sexual abuse in soccer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Woodward recently became the first professional player in Britain to go public with his story of sexual abuse. At least 20 other former players have followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of soccer's governing body in England has called the episode &quot;one of the biggest crises&quot; in the sport's history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leading technology titans like Bill Gates of Microsoftand Jack Ma of Alibaba are helping to start a fund that would invest more than $1 billion in energy technologies to combat climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And investors who control more than $5 trillion in assets have agreed to drop some or all of their fossil fuel stocks. The divestment movement has doubled in size in 15 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We visited a start-up in Massachusetts that seeks to build a better and safer smartphone battery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Improving battery technology has challenged scientists for more than a century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Don't view retirement as a light at the end of a career tunnel, our personal finance writer warns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He offers a fewtips to rearrange your work life, such as: &quot;If you realize that you aren't going to retire, then maybe you don't have to keep working at a job that's slowly driving you insane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. stocks were down on Monday. Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taking a stroll with Ai Weiwei.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese artist takes us on a walk through Tompkins Square Park, his old stomping ground in New York, in one of ourrecent 360 videos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Golden Globe nominations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;La La Land&quot; garnered seven nods, with &quot;Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Manchester by the Sea&quot; not far behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our reporters and editors sought out some of the nominees. &quot;I just woke up to, like, a thousand messages. It's a good way of finding out,&quot; Donald Glover, the creator and star of the TV show &quot;Atlanta&quot; said of his two nominations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Science roundup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new project uses satellite images to illustrate how the world's lakes and rivers have been altered over the past three decades by drought and warming temperatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And scientists recently reported that monkeys have vocal tracts that would allow them to talk, but that their brains aren't wired for intelligible speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, researchers offer some advice on gift-giving: Recipients often don't care how much thought went into the present. In other words, don't try so hard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recipe of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Try farro and bean soup. Add pancetta to give the dish even more flavor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Basketball celebrates its 125th birthday this month. Its inventor, Dr. James Naismith, intended the sport to keep athletes vigorous through the winter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He might be surprised at the game's popularity worldwide nowadays: especially in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where at least 300 million people play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Y.M.C.A. missionaries introduced the game in Tianjin in 1895 and, using a Chinese translation of Naismith's rule book, spread it widely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yao Ming lifted basketball's profile in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after becoming the top pick in the 2002 N.B.A. draft, but earlier factors helped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the Communist Party embraced it. Games maintained soldiers' morale during the Long March, when Mao Zedong led the Red Army on a yearlong retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while Mao declared war against almost all Western imports during the Cultural Revolution, &quot;he never wavered in support of basketball,&quot; The Atlantic reported in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1979, a few years after President Richard M. Nixon's historic visit, the N.B.A.'s Washington Bullets (now Wizards) visited to play </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> national team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everywhere you went and there was open space, you saw a basketball hoop,&quot; the Washington coach said. &quot;It was just a matter of time before they developed it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the N.B.A. later opened offices there, and it has succeeded where companies like Google and Facebook have struggled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles McDermid contributed reporting.</SPAN></P>
