<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A VOTE for Hillary Clinton over Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Clinton campaign has suggested in broad ways and subtle ones, isn't just a vote for a Democrat over a Republican: It's a vote for safety over risk, steady competence over boastful recklessness, psychological stability in the White House over ungovernable passions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This theme has been a winning one for Hillary, in her debates and in the wider campaign, and for good reason. The perils of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency are as distinctive as the candidate himself, and a vote for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> makes a long list of worst cases -- the Western alliance system's unraveling, a cycle of domestic radicalization, an accidental economic meltdown, a civilian-military crisis -- more likely than with any normal administration. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his supporters almost admit as much. ''We've tried sane, now let's try crazy,'' is basically his campaign's working motto. The promise to be a bull in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">china</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shop is part of his demagogue's appeal. Some of his more eloquent supporters have analogized a vote for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to storming the cockpit of a hijacked plane, with the likelihood of a plane crash entirely factored in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But passing on the plane-crash candidate doesn't mean ignoring the dangers of his rival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The dangers of a Hillary Clinton presidency are more familiar than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> authoritarian unknowns, because we live with them in our politics already. They're the dangers of elite groupthink, of Beltway power worship, of a cult of presidential action in the service of dubious ideals. They're the dangers of a recklessness and radicalism that doesn't recognize itself as either, because it's convinced that if an idea is mainstream and commonplace among the great and good then it cannot possibly be folly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Almost every crisis that has come upon the West in the last 15 years has its roots in this establishmentarian type of folly. The Iraq War, which liberals prefer to remember as a conflict conjured by a neoconservative cabal, was actually the work of a bipartisan interventionist consensus, pushed hard by George W. Bush but embraced as well by a large slice of center-left opinion that included Tony Blair and more than half of Senate Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Likewise the financial crisis: Whether you blame financial-services deregulation or happy-go-lucky housing policy (or both), the policies that helped inflate and pop the bubble were embraced by both wings of the political establishment. Likewise with the euro, the European common currency, a terrible idea that only cranks and Little Englanders dared oppose until the Great Recession exposed it as a potentially economy-sinking folly. Likewise with Angela Merkel's grand and reckless open-borders gesture just last year: She was the heroine of a thousand profiles even as she delivered her continent to polarization and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This record of elite folly -- which doesn't even include lesser case studies like our splendid little war in Libya -- is a big part of why the United States has a ''let's try crazy'' candidate in this election, and why there are so many Trumpian parties thriving on European soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One can look at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> himself and see too much danger of still-deeper disaster, too much temperamental risk and moral turpitude, to be an acceptable alternative to this blunder-ridden status quo ... while also looking at Hillary Clinton and seeing a woman whose record embodies the tendencies that gave rise to Trumpism in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed what is distinctive about Clinton, more even than Bush or Obama, is how few examples there are of her ever breaking with the elite consensus on matters of statecraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She was for the Iraq War when everyone was for it, against the surge when everyone had given up on Iraq, and then an unchastened liberal hawk again in Libya just a few short years later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She was a Russia dove when the media mocked Mitt Romney for being a Russia hawk; now she's a Russia hawk along with everyone else in Washington in a moment that might require de-escalation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She cites Merkel as a model leader, she's surrounded by a bipartisan foreign policy cadre that's eager for a Details To Be Determined escalation in Syria, and she seems -- like her Goldman Sachs audiences -- intent on sailing serenely above the storm of nationalism rather than reconsidering any of the assumptions of her class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The good news is that she is not a utopian; she is -- or has become, across a long and grinding career -- temperamentally pragmatic, self-consciously hardheaded. So she is unlikely to do anything that the cosmopolitan capitals of Europe and America would consider obviously radical or dangerous or dumb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in those cases where the cosmopolitan position isn't necessarily reasonable or safe, in those instances where the Western elite can go half-mad without realizing it, Hillary Clinton shows every sign of being just as ready to march into folly as her peers.</SPAN></P>
