<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A special issue, dedicated to historic voyages. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a backpacking fanatic and an international trekker, I was excited to read the Voyages Issue of the magazine, but as I paged through the photos in that section, my heart sank. Guess who's missing? Women. Nary a one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Female explorers and adventurers exist in droves, of course. When you leave half the world's population out of your coverage, perhaps only half of us will read your stories. That's a lot of market share you might be missing. Let us in. We're quite interesting once you get to know us. Lynn Boulger, Mount Desert, Me.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I read with pleasure and admiration the stories of courage, determination and curiosity that constitute the Voyages Issue. But as I read your magazine from cover to cover, I was also amused by how, along with those demanding and harrowing adventures, the issue was larded with full-page ads for luxurious condominiums and those for vacations to the distant and alien shores of Florida. As a former professor of English and a writer myself, I can always count on your publication for such quintessential examples of ironic juxtaposition. Katherine Fishburn, Hagerstown, Md.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  RE: ON MONEY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Adam Davidson parsed Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> love of ''the deal,'' which may reveal a dangerous and outmoded vision of the whole economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Adam Davidson shows why a President Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be a bad deal for the United States economy. In addition, he should explain that not all deals are win-lose. Some actions are lose-lose and others are win-win. In electing a president, we should strive for a person who will try for win-win and to avoid lose-lose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Davidson is correct in implying that the government should be working to make the United States more productive in high-income products and services, which implies that we cannot be complacent with respect to education, both technical and classical, and that we need to invest in our infrastructure, so that it is world class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> focuses the public's attention on the increasing prosperity of others, who are catching up to us. I imagine few </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters would opt to live in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or take the agricultural jobs of Central American illegal immigrants. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> noise prevents serious discussion of reforms America needs to undertake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With due respect, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a brilliant, egotistical lout mistaking the voting public for ignoramuses. Dick Raskin, Mount Kisco, N.Y.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Adam Davidson presents a fascinating explanation of ''rent seeking,'' but I believe that he misses the central point about Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and ''deals.'' It is not so much that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has a misguided notion of what deals can accomplish (he does), but that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is addicted to making deals, much as a gambler is always seeking action. Some are good deals, while some are incredibly bad (like buying the Plaza Hotel for a considerable sum and then having it sold for a loss after sinking even more money into renovations), but he is apparently compelled to make deals and sees all of life, not just the world economy, in terms of deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's why he is always working a hustle. It is unlikely that he is analytical enough to have a philosophy of world economics of any sort; he simply sees every issue as an opportunity to make a deal. Richard Kogut, Merced, Calif.</SPAN></P>
