<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Hillary Clinton said Sunday that the F.B.I. has not asked to interview her as part of the agency&amp;#8217;s inquiry into her use of a personal email server as secretary of state. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton said Sunday that the F.B.I. had not asked to interview her as part of its&nbsp;inquiry into her use of a personal email server as secretary of state. But Mrs. Clinton reiterated on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation&quot; that she would make herself available to law enforcement officials as necessary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation into Mrs. Clinton's email practices and her handling of classified intelligence has shadowed her presidential campaign, andCNN reported last week that she was likely to be interviewed soon by the F.B.I.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton said on Sunday that no meeting had been requested or scheduled. &quot;No one has reached out to me yet,&quot; she said, adding, &quot;I made it clear that I'm more than ready to talk to anybody, anytime, and I've encouraged all of my assistants to be very forthcoming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As she has done in the past, Mrs. Clinton said she had erred in setting up a private email server but said she &quot;always took classified material seriously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mrs. Clinton also sought to turn around the scrutiny she was facing, arguing that it was time for&nbsp;the Republican candidate&nbsp;Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to face similar examination. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> she noted, had not released his tax returns, as is customary for presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he is being audited and that it would be improper to release his taxes until that process is complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That explanation, Mrs. Clinton said, &quot;just by any analysis, doesn't hold up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keeping up her campaign's drumbeat of criticism against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Clinton said she considered Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy views - including his endorsement of torture, his description of climate science as a hoax perpetrated by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his &quot;cavalier&quot; ideas about nuclear weapons - to be outlandish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton said she had received an influx of interest from Republicans in recent days, as the party's reservations about installing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the presidency sink in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you have former presidents, when you have high-ranking Republican officials in Congress raising questions about their nominee,,&quot; she said, &quot;I don't think it's personal so much as rooted in their respect for the office and their deep concern about what kind of leader he would be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
