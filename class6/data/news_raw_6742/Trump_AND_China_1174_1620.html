<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(In this new section, we'll help you start your day just right.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A New Year's challenge for the mind: Make this the year that you quiet all those negative thoughts swirling around your brain. Here's how to do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you're hitting the gym this morning, don't forget to warm up. It may just save your knees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David Bowie resurfaced in a new video for one of his final songs just hours before what would have been his 70th birthday on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NASA announced plans for a spacecraft named Psyche to visit an asteroid that appears to be made of metal. &quot;Not only is it unique,&quot; an expert said, &quot;it's improbable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
