<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A backlash has been building gradually among American voters for years against ''stagflation,'' ''the middle-class squeeze,'' cross-border trade deals and Wall Street bailouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, they let out a primal scream that was heard around the country. The democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and the Republican billionaire Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recorded smashing primary victories in New Hampshire, and even if neither candidate reaches the general election in November, their supporters will shape the selection of the next president. The populist revolt is rooted in decades of failure by politicians to improve the living standards to which Americans became accustomed during post-World War II boom times. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States' receding economic dominance was masked for years by a surge in two-paycheck households as women entered the work force, an expansion of consumer credit and government borrowing, and surging stock and real estate values that inflated household wealth. Those props have now eroded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sanders translates stagnant middle-class incomes and rising inequality into outrage against Wall Street ''millionaires and billionaires'' who prosper in a global economy under rules they've written. His message is attractive to liberals, especially young Democrats facing large college debt and lackluster earning prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Tonight we serve notice to the political and economic establishment of this country that the American people will not continue to accept a corrupt campaign finance system that is undermining American democracy,'' he declared in New Hampshire. ''We will not accept a rigged economy in which ordinary Americans work longer hours for lower wages while almost all new income and wealth goes to the top 1 percent.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> voices similar sentiments, his own wealth notwithstanding. He invokes his experience as a donor to highlight campaign finance corruption, accuses hedge fund managers of dodging taxes and joins Mr. Sanders in denouncing various industries for what he says are undeserved profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> message, targeted toward the swelling Republican ranks of working-class whites, points more toward external threats on immigration and trade policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are going to make America great again,'' he declared as the returns rolled in. ''But we're going to do it the old-fashioned way. We're going to beat </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japan. We're going to beat Mexico at trade. We're going to beat all of these countries that are taking so much of our money away from us on a daily basis.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both men will be tested in different ways as the campaign moves forward, notably in the South for the ''Super Tuesday'' contests on March 1, effectively a make-or-break day for many candidates when 15 states and territories will hold electoral contests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> challenge will be to maintain his edge after the field of rivals narrows, allowing the large cadre of anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Republicans to coalesce their support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The hurdle facing Mr. Sanders is largely demographic. Hillary Clinton begins the next phase with a big advantage among African-American and Hispanic voters, who represent a much bigger share of the Democratic electorate than in overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet regardless of how the candidates finish, their populist messages will continue to influence the White House race -- and President Obama's final year in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has offered a tax-cut plan that, like those of his Republican rivals, would provide disproportionate benefits to the wealthy. But his call for higher taxes on income for hedge-fund managers and for curbs on the influence of campaign donors has lent bipartisan legitimacy to longstanding Democratic arguments. So has his support for competitive bidding to cut government health care payments to pharmaceutical companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All four winners in the opening Iowa and New Hampshire contests -- Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Senator Ted Cruz -- have opposed Mr. Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. That diminishes the likelihood that Congress will approve it this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Business and political leaders backing the trade deal question how it could stall as the economy grows steadily enough to drop unemployment below 5 percent. The answer lies in the anxiety revealed by New Hampshire election exit polls: Fewer than one in five voters in both the Democratic and Republican contests believe their families are getting ahead financially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's enough to make a voter angry.</SPAN></P>
