<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nurse said he hoped the world would hear &quot;our final scream.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, whose antidrug campaign has left more than 3,000 people dead, made some of his most controversial comments to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his years as the mayor of the city of Davao, he said, he would patrol on a motorcycle, &quot;looking for a confrontation, so I could kill,&quot; he told a Manila newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Killing suspects &quot;personally,&quot; he said, helped goad police officers - &quot;just to show to the guys that if I can do it, why can't you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan welcomes President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for two days of talks, hoping for progress in a decades-old territorial dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meetings come against a backdrop of uncertainty in relations between the U.S. and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and tensions over the evidence of Russian interference in the U.S. election on behalf of President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top U.S. commander in the Asia-Pacific, Adm. Harry B.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Federal Reserve, citing the steady growth of the American economy, raised its benchmark interest rate slightly, just the second increase since the global economic crisis of 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. stocks rose briefly, and then slid as investors appeared to realize that the Fed was likely to be leaning against growth and inflation in the future. Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As part of his campaign to stimulate the economy, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and three of his children met with the leaders of the world's most elite and successful technology companies: Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before reporters were ushered out of the room, he said, &quot;I'm here to help you folks do well,&quot; adding, &quot;And you're doing well right now and I'm very honored by the bounce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's how you can protect yourself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japan removed a longstanding prohibition against gambling, amid projections of a $40 billion a year industry. &quot;Japan is seen as the crown jewel of Asian gaming development outside of Macau,&quot; an analyst said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A giant American private equity group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, is among a group of investors offering $5.5 billion for Tatts Group, the Australian gambling operator. Tatts shares jumped on anticipation of a bidding war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meitu, best known for an app that beautifies selfies, begins trading in Hong Kong with a valuation in the vicinity of $5 billion, offering a gauge of international interest in Chinese start-ups.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. blocked an arms deal to Saudi Arabia over concerns about civilian casualties in Yemen. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pentagon tightened rules on combat for the second time this year, aiming to increase protections for civilians. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Australia's Defense Department failed to account for nearly $200 million in spending over and above the service contracts for military bases. [Sydney Morning Herald]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japanese officials pushed the U.S. military to ground its troubled tilt-rotor Osprey aircraft after one crashed off Okinawa. [Asahi Shimbun]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of John Glenn has resurfaced memories of his famous orbit of Earth in 1962. Back then, there wasn't much debris to block his view or threaten his spacecraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not so anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humans have created millions of pieces of so-called &quot;space junk&quot; during the past 60 years of space exploration. While most are less than 10 centimeters in diameter, even tiny objects can threaten spacecrafts and communications satellites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Going at 17,500 miles per hour, a little marble can wipe out a space station,&quot; said John Crassidis, an University at Buffalo engineering professor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When bits of junk collide, they often break apart, creating more debris. Adding to the clutter are the abundance of satellites technology companies are launching these days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NASA has called for stronger international regulations. &quot;It's a political mess,&quot; Dr. Crassidis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan, though, is stepping forward to confront the challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week its national space agency launched a spacecraftfeaturing a 700-meter cable that can safely guide debris into Earth's atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the mission works, it could lead to more innovative approaches, like one a Japanese entrepreneur, above, recently discussed with The Times. He wants his company to be the leader in extraterrestrial trash collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its slogan: Space Sweepers.</SPAN></P>
