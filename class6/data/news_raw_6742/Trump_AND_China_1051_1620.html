<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The nomination of a deal maker to the post indicates that Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration is likely to emphasize helping companies raise capital rather than tighten regulations.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal-making president-elect has nominated another deal maker to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nomination of Walter J. Clayton, a partner at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, indicates that Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration is likely to emphasize helping companies raise capital rather than tighten regulations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Clayton, who is known as Jay, had a front-row seat to the financial crisis, advising Barclays Capital in buying the assets of the bankrupt lender Lehman Brothers, and Bear Stearns in its fire sale to JPMorgan Chase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His colleague, H. Rodgin Cohen, withdrew his name from consideration for a senior Treasury role in 2009 amid an outcry over his involvement in nearly all the bank deals struck during the financial crisis. Mr. Clayton is expected to face similar scrutiny on his confirmation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan &amp; Cromwell has also been the go-to law firm for Goldman Sachs, which Mr. Clayton advised on a $5 billion investment by Berkshire Hathaway. This is likely to fuel criticism that Goldman Sachs wields too much influence in the administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some are pleased with the choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Clayton is viewed as a pragmatic man with experience and knowledge of financial regulatory matters. Brad Whitman, vice chairman in mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley, said the nominee had a &quot;great appreciation for what drives business and growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This could be useful because Federal Reserve officials, optimistic as they are about economic growth, see little chance of the boom that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is partly because they plan to raise interest rates if growth accelerates. Still, they are waiting to see what the next administration holds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accounts of their last meeting said officials were not yet ready to predict how the pace of rate increases might change as a result of new policies pursued by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slow Progress for Women and Minorities at Law Firms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women and minorities made small and slow gains in numbers at major American law firms last year, according to the National Association for Law Placement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James G. Leipold, executive director of the association, noted that larger firms achieved more diversity than smaller firms. However, the &quot;incredibly slow pace of change continues to be discouraging.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase in minority lawyers was linked to a greater number of Asian lawyers in associate ranks. The proportion of Hispanic lawyers also edged up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These levels of representation did, however, evaporated when it came to permanent jobs, indicating that law firms still struggled to retain and promote them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quotation of the Day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Five huge companies that can only get bigger are set against governments that increasingly see them as a clear threat to governing authority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
