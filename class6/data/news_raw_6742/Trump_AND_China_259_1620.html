<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TOKYO -- Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has often aimed his raucous brand of disparagement at foreign countries during his presidential run. There is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, ''ripping off'' the United States on trade and stealing its jobs. And Mexico, closing its eyes to a flood of migrants and drugs across the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his preoccupation with Japan is perhaps more unusual, if not anachronistic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chastised Japan last week in a Republican candidates' debate, naming it along with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mexico as countries where ''we are getting absolutely crushed on trade.'' He has previously accused Japan of manipulating its currency to achieve an unfair economic advantage, and of exploiting its military alliance with the United States to protect itself at little risk and cost.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His complaints are reminiscent of another era, when Japan's economy was booming and its companies were buying trophy American assets like movie studios and Rockefeller Center. Since the 1990s, though, Japan's growth has been mostly flat, and trade friction much more subdued, even as the United States continues to run large trade deficits with Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whereas Japanese officials once feared so-called Japan-bashing by Americans, today they are more likely to lament ''Japan-passing,'' a shift in attention to places viewed as more dynamic, like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments on Japan remind me of the period from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s, when Japan was considered a serious rival to American economic pre-eminence,'' said Glen S. Fukushima, a former United States trade official who is now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal policy group. ''It's interesting that despite the two-decade stagnation of the Japanese economy, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is now reviving the idea of Japan as an economic rival robbing America of jobs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Or, as Robert E. Kelly, an East Asia specialist at Pusan National University in South Korea, put it on Twitter during the Republican debate: ''Japan, Japan, Japan again. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is living in the Michael Crichton '80s.'' (Mr. Crichton's best-selling novel ''Rising Sun,'' published in 1992, depicted a Japan that waged ruthless economic war against the United States.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ascendance has begun to cause serious unease in Japan. Even if his run ends short of the White House, the worry is that an election dominated by such talk could leave the United States more closed to trade and less willing to defend its allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''My friends in the Foreign Ministry are in a state of panic,'' said Kiichi Fujiwara, an expert on international politics at the University of Tokyo. ''This is the first time in a long time that we've seen straightforward protectionism from an American presidential candidate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Major Japanese newspapers published critical editorials a day after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sweeping victories in the Super Tuesday primaries last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If there is a big shake-up in American politics, there is a danger that Japan could become an outlet for popular dissatisfaction with the spread of inequality and other issues,'' The Nikkei financial daily said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One concern is that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rivals will shift to more isolationist positions to counter him. Last month, Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, who is also contending with skepticism on trade from her party rival, Bernie Sanders, criticized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Japan in an opinion piece published in American regional newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Japan and other Asian economies kept their goods artificially cheap for years by holding down the value of their currencies,'' she wrote, adding that the United States should consider ''effective new remedies, such as duties or tariffs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton has also backed away from her support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal that includes Japan and is awaiting ratification by the participating countries. She helped promote the deal as secretary of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're already drawing up new laws and regulations, but it could all unravel,'' said a senior Japanese official involved in the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential. ''Our best hope is to ratify it quickly, along with other countries, to put pressure on the U.S. to follow through.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As he does with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accuses Japan of taking American jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After his victories on Super Tuesday, he called out Komatsu, a Japanese manufacturer of construction machinery, saying the weak yen gave it an unfair advantage over its American rival Caterpillar. He pledged to use equipment from Caterpillar and John Deere, another American manufacturer, to build his promised wall on the border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Globalization has stirred the public anxiety over jobs that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is seizing on. Japan exports more than twice as much to the United States as it buys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But globalization has also blurred lines between foreign and domestic companies in ways not accounted for in Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> criticisms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to its factories in Japan, Komatsu has plants overseas, including three in the United States -- though it imports key components, like hydraulic pumps and motors, from Japan, where it also keeps its high-paying design and engineering operations. Caterpillar and John Deere are much the same, manufacturing at home and overseas but keeping engineering mostly in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attacks could play well in places like Michigan and Ohio, important primary states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Their economies have suffered as manufacturing has moved abroad. Carmakers and unions, still influential forces in those states, have been vocal critics of the way Japan's government has let the yen depreciate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The last thing I want to do is come off as defending Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but there is an issue with the yen,'' said an official at the United Automobile Workers union, which traditionally supports Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Japan's currency has fallen as much as 40 percent against the dollar since 2012, though it is up somewhat this year. The decline has made Japanese carmakers like Toyota and Honda more profitable by increasing the value of their overseas sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Japanese officials say the yen's fall is simply a side effect of domestic policies aimed at ending persistent deflation, not a deliberate effort to gain an edge in trade. Yet Prime Minister Shinzo Abe campaigned openly in 2012 for weakening the yen to aid Japanese manufacturers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Just because the Japanese government no longer repeats that, doesn't mean the goal has changed,'' said Stephen E. Biegun, Ford's vice president for international governmental affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No one can accuse Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of coming to the issue late. He has been saying many of the same things for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They come over here, they sell their cars, their VCRs. They knock the hell out of our companies,'' he told Oprah Winfrey in 1988. In a Playboy interview in 1990, he said: ''First they take all our money with their consumer goods, then they put it back in buying all of Manhattan.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On military matters, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has expressed dissatisfaction with the United States' decades-old alliance with Japan. It obliges the United States to go to Japan's aid if Japan is attacked. But Japan is not obliged to do the same, because of its war-renouncing Constitution, which was imposed by occupying American forces after World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Abe says he, too, is unhappy with the ''unbalanced'' alliance. He has been trying to carve out a more active role for Japan's military, despite opposition from constitutional experts and much of the Japanese public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the United States turned toward isolationism, the Japanese prime minister would be emboldened. But it would be a delicate balancing act. An American disengagement from Asia in the face of an increasingly assertive </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and North Korea would be a harrowing situation for Japan's leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The U.S. has been saying for some time that Japan needs to bear more of the burden for regional stability,'' said Jiro Aichi, a member of Parliament from Mr. Abe's Liberal Democratic Party. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is saying it in a more extreme way, but it's a fact that Japan has to do more.''</SPAN></P>
