<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The Vermont senator says the president-elect must be held to promises he made to the middle class.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont vowed on Wednesday to hold Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accountable for the promises he made to the middle class while also insisting that the president-elect rescind his appointment of Stephen K. Bannon as his chief White House strategist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sanders, speaking at George Washington University and for a livestreamed video viewed by thousands, urged Democrats still reeling from the losses of last week to push forward by embracing the progressive ideals that fueled the senator's bid for the White House.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In doing so, he chastised liberals for not talking enough to the working class. He said that while he disagreed with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on many issues, he hoped to work with him to address income inequality, increase inadequate wages and negotiate new trade deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I personally believe we need major, major reforms of the Democratic Party,&quot; Mr. Sanders said, explaining that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign message resonated with millions of people. &quot;Toward the end of the campaign, he was actually using the term that many Democrats don't use, and he was saying he was going to be the champion of the American working class. That's what he said. Well, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, we have a list of everything that you said, and we are going to hold you to account.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sanders also pointedly criticized Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for giving a critically important job to Mr. Bannon, theformer head of Breitbart News who many fear will bring anti-Semitic, nationalist and racist views to the West Wing. The senator said Democrats &quot;will not be involved in the expansion of bigotry, racism, sexism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I call upon Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to rescind the appointment that he made of Mr. Bannon,&quot; said Mr. Sanders, making a demand that is unlikely to be met. &quot;The president of the United States should not have a racist at his side, unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sanders said he would push Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to make Wall Street reforms, to raise the federal minimum wage and to ensure at least six weeks of mandatory maternity leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said, however, that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has said that climate change may be a hoax made by the Chinese government, would need to &quot;read a little about science&quot; and focus on making America rely more on renewable energy sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sanders's speech came as Democrats desperately try to figure out how to regroup and energize the party now that Republicans control the White House, the Senate and the House. The Vermont senator, along with progressives like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, represents one wing of the party that is vying for power as more moderate Democrats aligned with Hillary Clinton consider the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren and a growing list of progressives have endorsed Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, who is now hoping to become the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech, Mr. Sanders also reminded his audience that he had defied the odds and won many states in the Democratic primaries by focusing on improving people's economic realities and by energizing a large number of young people who overwhelmingly preferred him to Mrs. Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are living in a nation that has a grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in which the top one-tenth of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent,&quot; Mr. Sanders said Wednesday, repeating an often-used phrase from his campaign. &quot;And that is the reality that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> perceived to be true, and he said, 'I hear that you are hurting and I hear and understand you're worried about the future for your kids and I alone can do something about it.' And people voted for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many Democrats will be prepared to work with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> if he turns out to be sincere about the promises he made during the campaign,&quot; Mr. Sanders said. &quot;If those promises turn out to be hollow, if they were nothing more than campaign rhetoric, we will not only oppose his economic policies, we will expose those hypocrisies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
