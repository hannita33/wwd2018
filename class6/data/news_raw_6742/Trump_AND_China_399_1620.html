<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The billionaire investor and nominee for commerce secretary said at his confirmation hearing that &quot;all aspects&quot; of the trade agreement were on the table.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilbur L. Ross, the billionaire investor who is President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> choice to become commerce secretary, vowed on Wednesday to make sweeping changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement his top priority as the incoming administration moves to overhaul its commercial partnerships around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made Nafta one of his favorite targets of derision during the presidential campaign, using it to blame Democrats for the loss of millions of industrial jobs. At his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Mr. Ross made it clear that the United States' northern and southern neighbors should prepare to renegotiate a pact that for decades has eased the flow of commerce among the countries. He said &quot;all aspects&quot; of the agreement were on the table.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As to Canada and Mexico, the president-elect has made no secret in his public remarks, nor have I, that Nafta is logically the first thing for us to deal with,&quot; said Mr. Ross, who will take a leading role in executing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade agenda. &quot;We ought to solidify relationships the best way we can in our own territory before we go off into other jurisdictions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next on his list could be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr. Ross suggested, as he assailed the country's high tariffs and what he described as empty claims of embracing free trade. Mr. Ross said he wanted to bring &quot;the reality closer to the rhetoric&quot; when it comes to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the most protectionist country of the very large countries,&quot; he said. &quot;They talk more about free trade than they actually practice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in spite of his promises to crack down on countries that are cheating on trade, Mr. Ross also tried to assuage concerns that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;America First&quot; philosophy will lead to protectionism and, potentially, economic disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not anti-trade,&quot; Mr. Ross insisted. &quot;I am pro-trade. But I am pro-sensible trade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the tariffs that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has called for imposing on some imports, Mr. Ross said he had learned the lessons of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised import taxes on thousands of goods in the 1930s and is widely believed to have extended the Great Depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The act &quot;didn't work very well then, and it very likely wouldn't work now,&quot; Mr. Ross said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, said he was worried that some of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> more provocative ideas, like a 35 percent tax on companies that sell products in the United States but manufacture them elsewhere, could be a drag on economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ross suggested that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a fellow deal maker, was simply being a shrewd negotiator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the president-elect has done a wonderful job preconditioning some of the other countries with whom we will be negotiating that change is coming,&quot; Mr. Ross said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has faced criticism for packing his economic team with rich patrons of Wall Street after running a populist campaign focused on lifting the middle class. Known in some circles as the &quot;king of bankruptcy,&quot; Mr. Ross, 79, made his fortune as a private equity titan who bought and sold the kinds of struggling industrial companies that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has promised to revive, often cutting jobs in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the hearing was largely cordial, Mr. Ross was heckled at one point by protesters who accused him of sending jobs offshore as a businessman. An analysis by Reuters this week found that companies controlled by Mr. Ross moved about 2,700 jobs to other countries since 2004 by relocating production from the United States. Mr. Ross on Wednesday defended his record as a job creator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr. Ross did have to let go one employee in recent weeks. In an unexpected revelation, he admitted he had unknowingly employed a household worker who might have been undocumented, a fact he said he discovered while preparing for his Senate confirmation process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ross said the employee had presented a Social Security card and a valid driver's license, both bearing that person's name, when hired in 2009. But during a check over the past month, the employee had been unable to provide similar documentation and was fired immediately, Mr. Ross said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We did the best that we thought we could do in order to verify the legality of the employment, and it turned out that was incorrect,&quot; Mr. Ross said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cabinet selections, Mr. Ross is facing scrutiny for a long business background that raises the potential for conflicts of interest. In a filing released this week, Mr. Ross indicated that he plannedto divest at least 80 assets and investment funds and step down from dozens of funds and firms in which he has financial stakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Democrats on the committee, like Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, expressed concern that conflicts of interest could be a problem for the administration because of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vast financial portfolio and his refusal to divest his holdings. Noting the financial sacrifice that Mr. Ross is making by becoming a public servant, Mr. Blumenthal asked if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should do the same for the sake of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ross said that he was not fully aware of the breadth of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> holdings but that he did know that presidents are held to different standards regarding conflicts of interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it is appropriate for him to judge,&quot; Mr. Ross said.</SPAN></P>
