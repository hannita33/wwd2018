<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, above, is in the midst of a learning curve after discovering that the nomination he accepted, to lead the Department of Energy, put him in charge of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a cabinet likely to include three billionaires, five former chief executives and some of the business world's most accomplished leaders, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> team will see if crafty deal making translates to good governance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Increasing levels of optimism have been tied to decreasing risks of death from cancer, heart disease, stroke and infections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recipe of the day: End the workweek by making rigatoni with white Bolognese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Fairy circles,&quot; the mysterious spots that speckle Namibia's grasslands, may actually be caused by competitive termites and &quot;self-organizing&quot; plants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And finally, our cultural critic reflects on one of the quieter aspects of President Obama's legacy: an &quot;unprecedented relationship to art and popular culture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are nearly 200 countries in the world. Sometimes, politicians, accidentally add more.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warsaw's top diplomat has been campaigning for a seat on the United Nations Security Council, and said the effort included holding talks with dozens of countries, &quot;such as Belize or San Escobar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fictitious People's Democratic Republic of San Escobar soon had a Twitter account, poking fun at the mistake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Waszczykowski was hardly the first politician to make this type of gaffe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2013, John Kerry as secretary of state praised American diplomats for supporting democratic institutionsin &quot;Kyrzakhstan,&quot; possibly a conflation of Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar mix-up was committed in 2015 here at The Times. In our story about the climber Tommy Caldwell, who was once kidnapped by militants, we mistakenly invented Kyrzbekistan. &quot;Caldwell was in Kyrgyzstan, not Kyrzbekistan, which does not exist,&quot; our correction read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herman Cain, a 2012 Republican candidate for president, though, took the blunder to a new level during an interview question about Uzbekistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when they ask me who is the president of Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan I'm going to say, you know, I don't know. Do you know?&quot;</SPAN></P>
