<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In Taipei, the capital, residents said they were pleased about the call between President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan and President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump.</SPAN><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAIPEI, Taiwan - What a difference a phone call makes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Taiwan - rendered nearly invisible in global affairs by decades of accommodation to Chinese pressure - the reaction tothe call between President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan and President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> late last week has been broadly positive, if tinged with caution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Tsai took office in May with a mandate to reduce Taiwan's economic reliance and close political ties with Beijing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> claims Taiwan as its territory and threatens to use force if Taipei officially acknowledges its de facto sovereignty. At her inauguration, Ms. Tsai said she wanted to improve relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, while also deepening ties with the United States and Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Tsai has moved her party, the Democratic Progressive Party, away from its pro-independence roots to a more nuanced form of Taiwan nationalism. The party's charter still features a clause advocating eventual official independence in the form of a Republic of Taiwan, although in July Ms. Tsai proposed replacing the clause with language that favors maintaining the status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, Hung Hsiu-chu, the chairwoman of the opposition Nationalist party, or Kuomintang, said she was glad to learn of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> support for Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am happy to see anything good for Taiwan,&quot; the KMT's website quoted Ms. Hung as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Hung's comment was notable because she has previously advocated unification with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Her party lost the presidency this year after eight years of moving closer to Beijing, which did not reduce its threat to Taiwan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has more than 1,500 missiles pointed across the Taiwan Strait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In interviews in Taipei, the capital, on Monday, residents said they were pleased about the phone call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that for the majority of Taiwanese people, this is the happiest thing that's happened to us since 1978, before the U.S. broke off diplomatic relations,&quot; Hsieh Jin-ho, a publisher and commentator, said in a phone interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States formally recognized the People's Republic of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 1979, abrogating its ties with Taiwan under the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Hsieh added that in general, Taiwanese had two different takeaways from the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One conclusion is that Taiwan needs to seize this opportunity in order to upgrade to fuller relations with the U.S. and expand its international friendly relations,&quot; he said. &quot;Another group of people fear that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continually increasing pressure will grow even larger&quot; and threaten Taiwan's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at her cafe in Taipei's Zhongshan district, Annie Hsieh, unrelated to Mr. Hsieh, smiled when asked about the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's great,&quot; Ms. Hsieh said. &quot;Reading that it's the first time in 37 years that the Taiwanese president and American president-elect have spoken, I feel like it's major progress by the new government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chen Hui-ling, a lawyer, praised Ms. Tsai, whose party controls Taiwan's presidency and legislature for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People who voted for the D.P.P. are paying attention to what it's doing,&quot; she said. &quot;They're looking to see if it will do something courageous, something different from the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Chen said she was struck by how most European lawyers she encountered on a recent business trip to London knew little about Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They may have heard that there are some problems between Taiwan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but that's all they know,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albert King, a fund manager, said the call was the main subject of conversation among his friends and associates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think all Taiwanese are happy to see the president-elect of the United States say it's O.K. to say 'president of Taiwan' or talk to the Taiwanese people as if we are a normal country,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't know how Americans look at this, but I think the president-elect has won the hearts of us Taiwanese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet he also sounded a note of caution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all know from our history that international politics is about realpolitik,&quot; he said. &quot;We have good faith, but we'll refrain from wishful thinking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1978, when Washington announced it would shift official recognition of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to Beijing, it sent Taiwan into the diplomatic wilderness in which it still resides. Since then, Taiwan has evolved from a oppressive martial state into a wealthy, progressive democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a long-awaited vindication of our denial by the world,&quot; Mr. King said of the Tsai-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> call. &quot;Even after we've achieved so much as a democracy, as a society, as an economy, we are not treated as equal to other countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although happy with Taiwan's moment in the sun, Jodie Lee, who works at an international nongovernmental organization in Taipei, is reluctant to place much faith in Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does this mean </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is going to restore relations with Taiwan?&quot; Ms. Lee asked. &quot;Or did he only pick up the phone because the U.S. sells us a lot of weapons?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. King described an increasingly unpredictable regional political environment, with the Philippines entering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> orbit, while Beijing's relations with Singapore have soured. And </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will make important leadership changes next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's all very delicate right now, so I'm not surprised that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been showing self-restraint,&quot; Mr. King said. &quot;I think that's a good sign, but I would not be surprised if they change their mind and decide to react very strongly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tectonic plates are shifting, we know it will bring earthquakes,&quot; he said. &quot;Risk is definitely rising - I'm an investor, I can see that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
