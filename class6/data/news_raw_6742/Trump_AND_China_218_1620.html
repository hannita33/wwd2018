<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING --  When dozens of world leaders gather for a summit meeting in Washington on Thursday, President Obama will meet privately with only one of them: President Xi Jinping of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one-on-one session signals the importance of the relationship, as a rising </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seems determined to be the dominant player in Asia, and the United States vows to retain its power in the Pacific. But relations between the two countries are at their lowest point in 15 years. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military expansion in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea may be the most prominent point of friction, but it does not help that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is distracted by a slowing economy and that trade with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has become a cudgel in the American presidential campaign. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Expectations that anything of substance will be accomplished in the 90-minute meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi are minimal. So it may be surprising that some analysts here and in the United States say it would be relatively easy for the two leaders to ease tensions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Xi could pledge not to go any further in militarizing disputed islands, said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. In return, he said, the Americans could agree to stop sending warships and aircraft on ''freedom of navigation'' patrols into territory claimed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States Navy has conducted two such patrols in the past several months, and there is a push in Congress for more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An American analyst, Douglas H. Paal of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said a show of restraint by both sides would be helpful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Offers of reassurance that restraint on new actions by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will lead to restraint on new significant or permanent military deployments by the U.S.'' would be a start, he said. Beijing, for example, could agree not to use landfill to build up the Scarborough Shoal, part of the contested Spratly Islands, over which the Philippines lost control to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, even though Mr. Xi has orchestrated the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea gambit, some foreign policy experts disagree with his stance. Those who are unhappy with his actions argue that the expansion alienates </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asian neighbors, pushing them closer to the United States -- the opposite of what Mr. Xi is trying to achieve through trade and diplomacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some Chinese scholars privately assert that in a gesture toward recognizing the authority of international maritime law, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could more closely set out its claim to the region by defining the so-called nine-dash line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The nine-dash line is a U-shape line that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has drawn on maps since the late 1940s to mark its claims over most of the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. The line overlaps territory claimed by countries including the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has never given the precise coordinates of the line, and the ambiguity gives Beijing room to maneuver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such a move would probably appeal to the United States, Mr. Paal said. Doing so, and acknowledging the primacy of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, would effectively limit </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> claims of sovereignty to waters within 12 nautical miles from any land within the lines, freeing up the sea within, American and Chinese experts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Chinese Foreign Ministry quietly proposed doing just that in 2011, a year before Mr. Xi came to power, and then dropped the idea, said Mr. Paal, who was the director of the American Institute in Taiwan in the administration of George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is unlikely to happen now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to Professor Shi, ''The South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea is strategic hardball, and it goes to key national interests.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last week, at a briefing on Mr. Xi's trip, Li Baodong, the vice foreign minister, made no attempt to sugarcoat the issue. When it comes to the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, he said sternly, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''has its own point of view and position.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under Mr. Xi, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has built artificial islands in disputed parts of the Spratly archipelago, equipping them with runways and ports capable of projecting substantial military power. In the Paracel Islands, which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has controlled since the early 1970s after pushing out Vietnam, the Chinese military has installed surface-to-air missile batteries and powerful radar facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those projects strengthen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hand in the strategic waterway, analysts said, in ways that it has never done before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Xi wants ''to force Asian maritime neighbors and the United States to accept the new status quo,'' Professor Shi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chinese children are taught that much of the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea has belonged to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since ancient times, making any move seen as reducing Beijing's claim seem a capitulation, scholars say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The same day he meets with Mr. Xi, Mr. Obama will meet with the leaders of America's two chief Asian allies, President Park Geun-hye of South Korea, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the heart of the conversation with the two allies will be the conundrum of North Korea and its expanding nuclear weapons program. North Korea's weapons tests, rocket launches and belligerent threats have persuaded Ms. Park that to defend itself, South Korea needs an American long-range missile-defense system known as Thaad, for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has long wanted to deploy the system there, but South Korea had resisted, unwilling to alienate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, its leading trading partner. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strongly objects to the deployment, which it says would allow United States military radar to penetrate deeper into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, compromising its security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said he would be willing to withdraw American troops from Japan and South Korea, and that he would be open to both countries developing their own nuclear weapons instead of depending on the United States for protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The South Korean and Japanese news media have been vocal in condemning the notion, though Chinses news outlets have been quiet, largely because Beijing does not like to address developments in democratic elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in some quarters in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, there is probably quiet satisfaction about the idea that those American allies would no longer have the support they have long enjoyed, said Evans J. R. Revere, a former senior State Department specialist on East Asia. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I strongly suspect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People's Liberation Army is pleased to know that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be prepared to dismantle the forward-deployed military presence that has kept the region at peace for over a generation,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
