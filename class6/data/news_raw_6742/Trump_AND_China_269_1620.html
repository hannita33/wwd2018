<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HONG KONG -- President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> golden quiff, bushy eyebrows and preening gestures were immortalized this week in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- though perhaps not in a way that he would like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They appeared on a giant rooster statue, just above some three-toed feet and a blood-red wattle that hangs below a gilded nose and mouth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The statue, which was installed outside a shopping mall in the northern Chinese city of Taiyuan, was built to celebrate the coming Year of the Rooster in the Chinese lunar calendar and comes less than a month before Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inauguration. It is 23 feet tall.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Relations between Washington and Beijing have been especially jittery in recent weeks. The tension is due in large part to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who belittled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during his presidential campaign and caused a diplomatic stir this month by making clear that he views the central basis for diplomatic relations between Washington and Beijing -- known as the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy -- as up for negotiation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But reaction to the rooster on Chinese social media was light and full of positive emoji.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Global Times, a state-run tabloid, said on Tuesday that onlookers in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province, had praised the statue as a ''perfect blend of Chinese and Western cultures.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's not bad looking,'' Zhang Guoqiang, an employee at the Yihui Japanese Restaurant at the North America N1 Art Shopping Center, where the statue is, said by telephone on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Inflatable ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chicken'' replicas were on sale at Taobao, an online shopping bazaar, with a 32-foot version advertised for $1,725.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Casey Latiolais, an illustrator and animator in Seattle, said in a telephone interview that he completed the design in early November for Beijing Reliance Commercial Land, a real estate company that had contacted him through Behance, a website where artists post their portfolios. Mr. Latiolais said the company had asked only for a statue to commemorate the Year of the Rooster and did not mention Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Latiolais, 30, declined to comment on why he had given the rooster </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-like features. But he said he had been surprised by the size of the final product, which is made of fiberglass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This was way more yuge than I expected,'' he wrote on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Latiolais said that he was also surprised when the statue was ''sort of bipartisanly looked at as funny'' by his friends and family -- including his parents, who voted for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was not the first time since the American presidential election that people in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had likened Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to a bird with notable hair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In November, photos by a Chinese journalist of a golden pheasant with a blond pompadour and a red body circulated widely on social media and were published online by People's Daily, the Communist Party's main newspaper. The bird, which lives in a safari park in the eastern city of Hangzhou, became a star attraction there and a muse for Hsiaohan Chen, a political cartoonist in Taipei.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has a penchant for lashing out at his critics, however minor, on Twitter. But as of Thursday afternoon, he had not commented on either bird.</SPAN></P>
