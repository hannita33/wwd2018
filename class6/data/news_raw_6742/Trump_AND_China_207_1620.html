<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite overwhelming scientific evidence that the world's climate is changing, the president-elect of the United States, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, has long been on the side of the deniers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2012, he posted on Twitter a couple of messages that asserted that climate change was a hoax that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had devised to secure an unfair trade advantage, presumably because the Obama administration was seeking to curb coal consumption in the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wrote. That message has been reshared more than 104,000 times and ''liked'' nearly 66,000 times.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Wednesday, a deputy foreign minister of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Liu Zhenmin, told reporters at a climate conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, that starting from the 1980s, the administrations of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Republican predecessors -- Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush -- supported climate change negotiations under a United Nations panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That was apparently an important moment in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> realization of the onset of climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Liu said that President Xi Jinping brought up the issue in his call with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Monday, saying that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would continue its struggle to curb climate change ''whatever the circumstances,'' according to Bloomberg News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lecturing the United States on the need to fight climate change is a reversal from the usual roles and a sign that, with the United States governed by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may have to take the leadership position in the global campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under President Obama, the United States government persuaded </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to announce important pledges in the fight against climate change. In 2014, Mr. Xi stood next to Mr. Obama in Beijing and said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would ensure that its greenhouse gas emissions peaked by 2030 and that 20 percent of its energy would come from non-fossil fuel sources by that year. Mr. Obama pledged to greatly reduce coal use by 2025.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Diplomats and climate negotiators have been meeting in Marrakesh this week to discuss steps needed to carry out the Paris climate agreement, which was negotiated last year and which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States signed this year. There has been much anxiety over whether Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might try to withdraw the United States from the pact after he takes office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the agreement now has enough countries as signatories to make it legally binding, and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may have a hard time extricating the United States from the deal. In addition, other countries have said they intend to go ahead with the plan on their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is a new world order,'' Erik Solheim, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, said in Marrakesh. ''Leadership on climate change policy has now gone to the developing countries, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> among them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, having the United States on board would be hugely helpful in trying to meet the ambitious goal of keeping the future increase in global temperatures below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The United States is the second-leading emitter of greenhouse gases, after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Researchers say greenhouse gas emissions have leveled off for at least three years now, mostly because of a drop in coal consumption in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. A major reason is the slowing Chinese economy. But it is still unclear whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> emissions have hit a peak, well before the 2030 deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is already grappling with the direct consequences of climate change, like melting glaciers in western mountain ranges and expanding deserts.</SPAN></P>
