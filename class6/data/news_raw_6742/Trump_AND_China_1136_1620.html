</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stocks on Wall Street gave up early gains and ended slightly lower, extending a losing streak for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index to a ninth day, the longest losing streak in 36 years. Investors continue to focus on the presidential election.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KEEPING SCORE The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index closed 0.2 percent lower. The Nasdaq composite index also lost 0.2 percent. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  PRESIDENTIAL RACE With five days left until the election, Hillary Clinton is still leading in national polling, but Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has significantly narrowed the gap, particularly in swing states. Investors like certainty, and Mrs. Clinton is viewed as likely to maintain the status quo. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policies are less clear, and the uncertainty has caused jitters in financial markets. The VIX, a measure of volatility that is called Wall Street's ''fear gauge,'' jumped 16 percent this week to its highest level since June. The measure is up 36 percent this week alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ANALYST'S TAKE ''No one really knows what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would do should he get into power, probably not even himself,'' said Joshua Mahony, a market analyst at IG. ''It is that uncertainty that is driving the market negativity that has dominated this week.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  JOBS BACKDROP Investors were encouraged by a government report early Friday that showed solid hiring by employers last month. The October figures, released on Friday, showed that employers added a decent 161,000 jobs and that the unemployment rate dipped to 4.9 percent from 5 percent. And average hourly pay took a big step up, rising 10 cents an hour to an average of $25.92. That is 2.8 percent higher than a year ago and is the sharpest 12-month rise in seven years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  OUT OF FOCUS GoPro, the maker of wearable cameras, reported a 40 percent drop in revenue in the quarter and gave a negative outlook for the holiday season. Like Fitbit, GoPro is showing signs of being unable to expand its product line beyond athletes and thrill-seekers. Its stock recovered after an early tumble but then ended the day down 6.5 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ENERGY Benchmark United States crude oil lost 66 cents, to $44 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, declined 82 cents, to $45.53.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  EUROPEAN MARKETS In Germany, the DAX fell 0.6 percent, and in France, the CAC 40 lost 0.8 percent. The FTSE 100 was down 1.4 percent in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ASIA'S DAY The Nikkei 225 declined 1.3 percent in Japan, while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng fell 0.2 percent. The Shanghai composite index slipped 0.1 percent in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kospi lost 0.1 percent in South Korea. In Australia, the S.&amp;P./ASX 200 lost 0.9 percent, while the Sensex in India was off 0.5 percent. Shares in Southeast Asia were mostly lower while Taiwan's benchmark was nearly flat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BONDS AND CURRENCIES Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.78 percent from 1.81 percent the day before. The euro rose to $1.1119 from $1.1109 and the dollar rose to 103.08 yen from 102.99 yen.</SPAN></P>
