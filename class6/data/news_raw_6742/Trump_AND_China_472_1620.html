<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JANESVILLE, Wis. -- Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has risen to front-runner status by giving voice to anti-establishment rage against the Republican Party, kicked off his quest for the support of Wisconsin voters at a rally on Tuesday afternoon in Janesville, the hometown of Speaker Paul D. Ryan -- the button-down, clean-cut steward of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wisconsin, whose middle class has been hard hit by a decline in manufacturing jobs, could prove fertile ground for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when it holds its presidential primary next Tuesday. He has defied Republican orthodoxy by opposing many trade deals, calling for high tariffs against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and railing against countries like Mexico and Japan that he says are taking away American jobs. Mr. Ryan generally supports free trade. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The issue could be particularly resonant in Janesville, where a General Motors plant once employed roughly 7,000 workers at its peak but ceased production in 2009, when it employed just 1,200 workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not mention the closed factory on Tuesday, but criticized the trade positions of his Republican rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who has also been portraying himself in Wisconsin as an advocate for working-class voters, and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Wisconsin's middle class, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, has been hit ''very, very hard due to loss of manufacturing jobs,'' and he warned that Mr. Cruz's and Mr. Kasich's support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement signed this year among a dozen Pacific Rim countries, would make things worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Pacific pact, he said, would make the North American Free Trade Agreement ''look like a baby, and Wisconsin will be hit so hard.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The rally was held in the wake of a speech Mr. Ryan gave last week that did not name Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but seemed aimed directly at him. Mr. Ryan urged Republicans to embrace civility and high-minded policy ideas, rather than the ''ugliness'' that he said had consumed the 2016 presidential race so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shortly after that speech, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a self-styled counterpuncher, responded by scheduling his first Wisconsin rally before the primary in Mr. Ryan's hometown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not attack Mr. Ryan on Tuesday. But when he asked the crowd how it liked its congressman, he was met by boos and jeers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Paul Rino,'' offered one attendee, using a derogatory acronym for ''Republican in name only.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I was told to be nice to Paul Ryan,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, sounding momentarily surprised. ''Are you all Republicans? Are you mostly conservative?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ryan was his party's 2012 vice-presidential candidate, and his name is still floated by party officials as a possible Republican nominee if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fails to secure the 1,237 delegates necessary to win the nomination outright. The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, is also from Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also addressed the arrest of his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who was charged on Tuesday with battery in Jupiter, Fla. Mr. Lewandowski was accused of jerking the arm of a reporter from Breitbart News, a conservative website, as she tried to ask a question after a campaign event this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> used a question about restoring discipline to schools to defend Mr. Lewandowski, spending three minutes walking his crowd through a play by play of his version of the episode, in which he sought to blame the reporter, Michelle Fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign originally denied Mr. Lewandowski had grabbed Ms. Fields. But after a series of still images from security cameras seemed to corroborate her account, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told the crowd here that on the security tape, Ms. Fields's face ''stayed the same'' instead of flinching, as he would have expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If somebody squeezed your arm or hurt you, wouldn't you start screaming or something?'' he asked. ''Did you see any change in her face?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> then claimed that Ms. Fields had seemed to be reaching out to touch him, and offered a competing theory -- that Mr. Lewandowski was defending him. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that ''maybe he touched her a little bit,'' but added, ''It was almost like he was trying to keep her off me, like he was helping her.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I can't destroy a man,'' he said, referring to some calls to fire Mr. Lewandowski. ''I'm not going to destroy a man for that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> visited Wisconsin the same day that Gov. Scott Walker endorsed Mr. Cruz during the radio program of Charlie Sykes, a popular conservative talk radio host in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began his remarks by criticizing the governor and noting that while Mr. Walker rides a Harley-Davidson, ''the motorcycle guys like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also went after Mr. Cruz, portraying him as a friendless puppet of the Republican Party leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Frankly, in a way it's worse, because Cruz is establishment and yet he's got no relationship with the establishment,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. ''He's sort of got the worst of all elements. He's an insider, totally, but he can get nothing done. He can get nothing done.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In advance of his trip, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made a series of calls on Monday to Wisconsin talk radio shows -- which carry outsize influence among the state's Republican primary voters -- and engaged in a combative back-and-forth with Mr. Sykes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ryan's office, in a statement (which again did not mention Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by name), said the speaker was excited to welcome presidential hopefuls to his state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Speaker Ryan is glad Republican candidates are campaigning for president in Wisconsin, including his hometown of Janesville,'' Zack Roday, a spokesman, said in a statement. ''Wisconsin voters expect to talk with candidates seeking public office and hear their views on the major issues before our nation so they can make an informed decision.''</SPAN></P>
