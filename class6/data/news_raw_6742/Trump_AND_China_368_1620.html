<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to assessing the presidential race, I prefer to listen to the spies. They tend to be brutally unsentimental, see through the nonsense and cut to the cold, hard bottom line. And right now, two of the world's foremost former spymasters are sending uncoded messages about what it will mean for America and the Western alliance if Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is elected president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce former C.I.A. Director Robert Gates and his longtime nemesis and former K.G.B. agent, President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Putin is voting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Gates is not. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an essay in The Wall Street Journal, Gates, who also was defense secretary for George W. Bush and Barack Obama, criticized both Hillary Clinton and Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for failing to take the threat posed by Putin's Russia seriously. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Gates added, has gone places with Putin no would-be American president should: ''Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> expressions of admiration for the man and his authoritarian regime are na&iuml;ve and irresponsible.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yes, Clinton has her own credibility issues on national security, Gates explained, but ''Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is in a league of his own. He has expressed support for building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico; for torturing suspected terrorists and killing their families; for Mr. Putin's dictatorial leadership and for Saddam Hussein's nonexistent successes against terrorism. He also has said he is for using defense spending by NATO allies as the litmus test on whether the U.S. will keep its treaty commitments to them; for withdrawing U.S. troops from Europe, South Korea and Japan and for the latter two developing nuclear weapons -- a highly destabilizing prospect.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton still has time to address her judgment and credibility issues and earn votes of people like himself, Gates said. As for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he said, ''on national security, I believe [he] is beyond repair. He is stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government, and temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform. He is unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I admire Gates for speaking out. Not enough attention has been paid to the national security implications of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm certain you'd see U.S. military officers and government officials quitting if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ordered them to torture captured terrorists, go house to house to evict illegal immigrants, start trade wars with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mexico or ban Muslims. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the chaos primary candidate became the chaos presidential nominee, and you can bet he'd be a chaos president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Being unpredictable as a leader is fine, if you know where you're going and it is a tool to get you there by keeping foes off balance. But being unpredictable because you have no discipline; because you think issues like ISIS are just a manhood test; because you have not studied the issues so anything can come out of your mouth; and because you don't realize that when we tell countries like Japan or South Korea or our NATO allies that we might not protect them from Russia or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, they will go get their own nukes and make the world even less stable -- well, that kind of unpredictability is how alliances get broken, messes get made and wars get started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's why Putin is licking his chops. It is no accident that Putin praised </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''as a really brilliant and talented person, without any doubt.'' It is also no accident that Putin's cyberagents have hacked the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign -- to create embarrassing leaks -- while ignoring both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the G.O.P. It's because Putin knows the same thing that Gates does: A President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would keep Washington and the Western alliance in turmoil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moreover, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has told so many baldfaced lies in the last year, I can't imagine what would happen if he had to take America into a war. Who would trust that he was telling the truth about anything?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also, because of how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has disparaged our NATO allies, it is impossible to envision him leading the alliance -- particularly if we have to blunt further Russian expansion. And how exactly is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> going to enlist Arab Gulf nations against ISIS or to counterbalance Iran, having stated that their Muslim citizens should be banned from entering the U.S.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Who will want to work with him? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is constantly saying extreme things and then taking them back or claiming to be misunderstood. Consider the havoc that will wreak with our diplomacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's why the cynical Putin admires </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, narcissist that he is, thinks it's because Putin really admires his leadership qualities. No, Donald. It's because Putin knows a mess-maker when he sees one, and the thought of America being led by a man who would be wildly unpopular simultaneously in Europe, Beijing, Mexico, South America and the Muslim world is for Putin a dream come true. The old K.G.B. could never make that happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So, young people, listen up: Hillary doesn't light your fire? O.K., I agree, she is a flawed candidate. But she can responsibly manage the affairs of state. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is beyond repair and won't just light your fire -- he'll burn the house down. Ask the old spies.</SPAN></P>
