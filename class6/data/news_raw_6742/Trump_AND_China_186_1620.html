</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SWIFT REPORTS A NEW ATTACK   |  Thieves have found their way into the Swift global bank network as investigators are still trying to solve the $81 million heist from the central bank of Bangladesh,<BR>Michael Corkery reports in DealBook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second attack involved a commercial bank, which Swift declined to identify. In a letter it planned to send to users on Friday, which The New York Times reviewed, Swift warned that the two attacks bore similarities and were likely part of a &quot;wider and highly adaptive campaign targeting banks.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banking experts said the attacks might be impossible to solve or trace. Swift said the thieves got their hands on legitimate network credentials, initiated the fraudulent transfers and installed malware on bank computers to disguise their movements. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The attackers clearly exhibit a deep and sophisticated knowledge of specific operation controls within the targeted banks - knowledge that may have been gained from malicious insiders or cyberattacks, or a combination of both,&quot;Swift said. It also warned that the gang of thieves may have been able to recruit bank employees to hand over credentials. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security experts who have studied the attacks said the thieves were probably lurking inside the bank systems for months before they were detected and are likely to strike again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swift's core messaging system was not breached, but the criminals attacked the banks' connections to its network. Banks are responsible for maintaining the security of their own connections to Swift and digital criminals have found ways to exploit loopholes in bank security to obtain login credentials and dispatch fraudulent Swift messages. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This second attack suggests a highly sophisticated threat that did not depend on weak digital defenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> APPLE INVESTS IN UBER'S RIVAL IN </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CHINA</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  |  Apple has put $1 billion into Didi Chuxing, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> biggest ride-hailing service, in one of its largest ever strategic investments,<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move into on-demand transportation is unusual for Apple, which has generally been quiet about its deals. It has purchased technology start-ups here and there, and bought Beats for $3 billion in 2014. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple's has also invested in the Chinese company as iPhone sales have flagged in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and its iBooks and iTunes mobile stores were shut in the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Didi exemplifies the innovation taking place in the iOS developer community in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said in a statement. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple has been working on its own secret car project and certainly has the money to spare. As of March 26, the company said it had nearly $233 billion in cash and marketable securities. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Didi Chuxing, is a major competitor to Uber, which is spending millions to make inroads in the Chinese market. Didi serves close to 300 million users, according to the company. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MINNESOTA LAW SCHOOL CUTS ADMISSIONS  |  The University of Minnesota has decided to shrink enrollment to preserve its national standing as a top law school even as some are arguing for broader inclusion of students who would fall outside the school's admissions parameters, </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elizabeth Olson reports in DealBook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Applications to law schools have plummeted nationwide and the Great Lakes region has been hit particularly hard, an effect amplified by the number of accredited law schools in the area. The region's rapidly aging population and the loss of its traditional manufacturing activity have eroded an economic base that could support a &quot;strongly upwardly mobile middle class of the kind that sustains high-level educational activity,&quot; David Barnhizer, a professor emeritus at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, wrote in a research paper. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minnesota has had one of the largest declines in applicants among the top 20 law schools, but no one knows why. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Wippman, the dean of the University of Minnesota Law School, has already overseen a shrinking first-year class, offsetting the loss in tuition income with more public subsidies. He said the school was trying to determine why applications for the course were dropping and was trying to identify students more precisely, while publicizing more broadly. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wippman had to decide whether to admit students with lower scores, but a surplus of graduates who do not find jobs can eviscerate a law school's reputation. Raising tuition was not an option with so many students wary of taking on high debt. The school was also facing competition from others in its hometown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the school opted for fewer students. It can at least tap into taxpayer funding, and almost three-quarters of its first-year students are from out of state and pay higher tuition fees. It has also shed staff and left openings unfilled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The execution of Mr. Wippman's strategies fall to his successor, Garry W. Jenkins, a law professor from Ohio State University Moritz College of Law. Mr. Jenkins has experience as a former chief operating officer and general counsel of the Goldman Sachs Foundation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ON THE AGENDA   |  Data on retail sales during April will be published at 8:30 a.m. The University of Michigan consumer survey for May will be published at 10 a.m. John C. Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, will speak at the Sacramento Economic Forum, which starts at 1 p.m. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">TRUMP'S</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CHIEF FUND-RAISER HEADS STRAIGHT TO LAS VEGAS  |  Steven Mnuchin has not wasted any time looking for big-money donors. He headed to the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference, or SALT, to meet with hedge fund managers less than a week after being recruited by Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Mnuchin sat with Scott Brown, the former Republican senator from Massachusetts, as he shook hands with prospective </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> donors. He also a attended a dinner that included the billionaire hedge fund manager Kenneth C. Griffin, David H. Petraeus, the former C.I.A. director and John A. Boehner, the former House speaker. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential politics was the main topic in the speeches delivered onstage, at the closed-door meetings and at the Champagne-filled after-hours events.<BR>But for many on Wall Street, it would be awkward to publicly support Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in light of his broadsides against the hedge fund industry. Many in the financial world said they would never support a Democratic candidate but have also publicly objected to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Even Anthony Scaramucci, who runs the investment firm SkyBridge Capital and who last week publicly endorsed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, has been one of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> loudest critics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Scaramucci took a different tone at SALT, saying that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was &quot;saying cuckoo-la-la things to insult the intelligentsia because what he's discovered is that the average American, the red-meat eating Middle American, loves the swipes at the know-it-alls and I think Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is enjoying doing that.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens said that he expected most Republicans to fall in line and back Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> eventually. He told an audience of money managers on Wednesday that he agreed with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposal to ban Muslims unless they were vetted. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In private and public, hedge fund managers at the conference in Las Vegas have expressed concern that the possibility of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as president could pose a risk to the economy and markets.</SPAN></P>
