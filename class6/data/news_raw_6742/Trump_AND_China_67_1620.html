<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> signaled on Thursday that it had installed weapons on disputed South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea islands and would use them like a ''slingshot'' to repel threats, compounding tensions with the incoming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese message, in a Defense Ministry statement, suggested that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was further watering down a pledge made by its president, Xi Jinping, to not militarize the islands. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The comments left little doubt that such installations were part of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plan to deepen its territorial claim over the islands, which has raised tensions with its neighbors over their rival claims and with Washington over freedom of navigation in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, one of the world's busiest commercial waterways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They were also likely to further complicate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> already testy relations with President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rapid creation of artificial islands in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, expanding former reefs and outcrops into guarded permanent outposts, has already become a major source of tension with Washington.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Repeatedly this year, the Chinese have accused the United States of making ''provocative'' moves by sending warships near some of these islands, known as the Spratlys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Chinese have been creating harbors, runways and reinforced hangars big enough for military aircraft on the islands. But new satellite images made public this week appeared to reveal weapons emplacements for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, which released the images through its Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, said they showed ''large antiaircraft guns and probable close-in weapons systems,'' which can theoretically thwart cruise missile attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Defense Ministry statement, posted on its website in response to the images, did not specify what kinds of weapons the images showed but said any military hardware on the islands was reasonable. It repeated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contention that its construction on the islands is mainly for civilian purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''As for necessary military facilities, they are primarily for defense and self-protection, and this is proper and legitimate,'' the Defense Ministry said. ''For instance, if someone was at the door of your home, cocky and swaggering, how could it be that you wouldn't prepare a slingshot?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was no immediate comment from Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or his transition team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recently angered Chinese officials by holding a phone conversation with Tsai Ing-wen, the president of Taiwan, an island that Beijing deems a breakaway province of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. It had been nearly four decades since a United States president or president-elect had such direct contact with a Taiwanese leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also criticized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over its trade imbalance with America, its military activities in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea and its ties to North Korea. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was ''building a massive fortress in the middle of the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, which they shouldn't be doing,'' he said in the interview on Fox News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During his campaign, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dwelled on accusations that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had systematically sapped American industrial might, and he has indicated that trade issues will be a priority in dealings with Beijing. But the latest disclosures suggest how seemingly remote islands in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea could become a source of serious tensions, even military strife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Spratlys, which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> calls the Nansha Islands, are the subject of an especially volatile mix of competing claims. Parts of the archipelago are also claimed by the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and Taiwan. And the possibility of undersea oil and gas deposits has exacerbated the rivalries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has moved in recent months to ease tensions with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and to distance his country from Washington. Even so, the Philippines keeps defense treaties with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with the world's second-biggest economy and a swelling military budget, has established an intimidating dominance across much of the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. And the latest satellite images appeared to confirm its deepening military grip on the Spratlys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The steps ''show that Beijing is serious about defense of its artificial islands in case of an armed contingency in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea,'' the Asia Maritime Defense Initiative said in its report about the images.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Among other things, they would be the last line of defense against cruise missiles launched by the United States or others'' against air bases that may soon go into operation on the islands, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The images showed that the facilities were in place before Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration sought to play down both the images and the Chinese Defense Ministry's response. ''We watch Chinese naval developments very carefully, and we urge all parties in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea to avoid actions that raise tensions,'' said Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The images elicited a far more contentious response from hawkish Republicans, who do not necessarily share Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> views on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade policy but see Beijing's actions in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea as an aggressive challenge to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the images confirmed ''what has long been evident: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is militarizing the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, its leaders continue to lie about that fact, and Beijing is paying little to no price for its behavior.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some American military officials suggested privately that the antiaircraft emplacements were purely defensive in nature, with a limited range, useful only if the outposts were under attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of greater concern, they said, was the possibility that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could one day install more advanced antiaircraft missile systems on the islands, which can fire at targets hundreds of miles away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., head of the United States Pacific Command, said on Wednesday that America would not abandon its military presence across the Asia-Pacific region. He indicated that American naval ships would continue passing through the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea to show that the United States ''will not allow the shared domains to be closed down unilaterally, no matter how many bases are built on artificial features in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Chinese government has said it respects freedom of civilian passage in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea but also called American naval ''freedom of navigation operations'' dangerous meddling. The Chinese navy has not tried to block the operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The latest images raised new doubts about the intent of comments made by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, Mr. Xi, after he met President Obama in the White House in September last year. With Mr. Obama at his side, Mr. Xi told reporters that ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not intend to pursue militarization'' of the islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Previous satellite pictures of the islands, released by the Asia Maritime Defense Initiative in August, already indicated that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was building military facilities there. Those images appeared to show reinforced aircraft hangars at the Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs, all part of the disputed parts of the archipelago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokesman for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday that his government had been entitled to take such steps and said they did not count as ''militarization.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The spokesman, Geng Shuang, said he could not confirm the precise findings from the latest satellite images but disputed they indicated any change on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> constructing normal facilities on its own islands and deploying necessary territorial defense facilities counts as 'militarization,''' he said, ''then what about sending fleets through the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea?''</SPAN></P>
