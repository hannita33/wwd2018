</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MARKETS SHAKY AS POLITICAL CHAOS CONTINUES IN THE WAKE OF 'BREXIT'  |  The turmoil that roiled markets on Friday gave way to weak sentiment on Monday morning, as uncertainty created by Britain's vote to leave the European Union weighed on Asian stocks,  Reuters reports. The pound tumbled further, sliding 2 percent in Asia on Monday, but the extreme volatility of last week receded a little. The euro also remained under pressure, while European stocks started the week with a slump and continued to slide later in the day. As with last week, banking stocks were battered. Shares in Barclays and RBS fell so much that they were suspended from trading.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the political chaos in Britain continued into Monday. The opposition Labour Party split into warring camps, while the governing Conservatives were drawing their battle lines, Steven Erlanger reports in The New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking before the European market open, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said he expected more volatility, but noted that the  British economy was &quot;about as strong as it could be&quot; and in a position to weather the effects of leaving the European Union, Jonathan Soble and Prashant S. Rao report in The New York Times. The pound pared some of its losses after his speech. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Premier Li Keqiang of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also noted on Monday that the referendum result had increased uncertainty in the global economy, Reuters reports. &quot;Against the backdrop of globalization, it's impossible for each country to talk about its own development discarding the world economic environment,&quot; Mr. Li said at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their concerns over the uncertain outlook are shared across the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London became a world financial center after a wave of financial deregulation thirty years ago, but a cloud of uncertainty hangs over it now. On Friday, finance workers congregated at pubs in the City, as Britain's Wall Street is known, pondering where jobs might move, Danny Hakim and Prashant S. Rao report in DealBook. Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt seemed the mostly likely options, but few were excited about the prospect. Some worried about returning to financial crisis conditions. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some experts have also raised the possibility that the British government could seek to save the financial sector by making the City more attractive as an offshore haven, Nelson D. Schwartz and Patricia Cohen report in The New York Times. &quot;This could lead to London becoming even more like the Cayman Islands and other British territories, skirting around regulations, in a race to the bottom for the financial sector,&quot; Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said. &quot;This potentially could leave pretty big holes in the financial safety net.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The art market is also fearful, Robin Pogrebin reports in The New York Times. London was regarded as the capital of the European art market, but  lots may be withdrawn this week by nervous consignors. Experts predicted that fewer pieces would come to market in Britain because of the fall in the value of the pound, although some are bullish about this, saying that it makes prices more attractive to foreign buyers. Others still think that people's trust in hard assets will keep the market going. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the world's central bankers are worried about how much action they can take should markets spiral, Landon Thomas Jr. reports in DealBook. Investors expect central banks to ride to the rescue if the vote sends global markets reeling, but some investors and economists fear that further intervention will worsen the sense of alienation and frustration at global elites that helped the &quot;leave&quot; side win the vote. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moves like bond buying and lowering interest rates used to be seen as easy policy substitutes when governments did not take action themselves. But the recent sell-off is not the result of an event like the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. When finance is hit by social and political crises, it becomes more awkward for central bankers to defend intervention. It is an acute concern for Britain, where, thanks to aggressive central bank policies, house prices have soared in London even as the inflation-adjusted average wage is still lower than it was before the financial crisis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Japanese authorities said on Monday that they were prepared to intervene to curb the rise of the yen, which can hurt Japanese exports.<BR>Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, said he had instructed the finance minister, Taro Aso, to &quot;coordinate with the Bank of Japan and be even more mindful of movements in the markets, including the currency market.&quot; The yen ticked down against the dollar after he spoke. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian government is also considering measures to prop up its banking sector, as financial stocks come under more pressure after the vote, The Financial Times reports, citing bankers and officials. Prime minister Matteo Renzi may request a suspension of state aid rules to allow a government-sponsored capital injection. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hedge fund industry has been comparatively placid about Britain's vote to leave the European Union,, although some were surprised by the result, Alexandra Stevenson reports in DealBook. Many fund managers watched the vote from the sidelines, and some had yet to recover from the turmoil created by Chinese stocks last summer. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will take some time to determine the winners, but George Soros, known as the man who broke the Bank of England with a bet against the British pound in 1992, looked smart after taking long positions in gold through an exchange-traded fund. Whether he took any positions to profit from a vote for so-called Brexit is unclear. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, has called for Britain and the European Union to move quickly to quell the uncertainty, The Financial Times reports. Ms. Lagarde noted the turmoil within Britain's political parties and said that European Union leaders had sent mixed messages on how Britain's exit from the bloc should be handled. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this point in time, policy makers both in the U.K. and in Europe are holding that level of uncertainty in their hands, and how they come out in the next few days is really going to drive the direction in which risk will go,&quot; she said on Sunday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain is expected to lead an emergency Cabinet meeting on Monday, and John Kerry, the United States secretary of state, is visiting Brussels and London to address the fallout from the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ON THE AGENDA  |  The ECB Central Banking forum starts with a welcome address from Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, at 1:30 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN PRIVATE EQUITY'S HANDS, PUBLIC SERVICES AND HOUSING IN DISARRAY  |  Since the 2008 financial crisis, private equity firms have taken over a widening array of civic and financial services that are central to American life,<BR>Danielle Ivory, Ben Protess and Kitty Bennett report in DealBook. People interact with private equity when they call emergency services, pay their mortgage, play a round of golf or turn on the kitchen tap for a glass of water. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike other for-profit companies, which often have years of experience in certain services, private equity's main skill is to make money. And in many of these businesses, it applied a sophisticated moneymaking playbook, cutting costs, increasing prices, litigating and lobbying, a Times investigation has found. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In emergency care and firefighting, this has created a fundamental tension when there is a push to turn a profit while caring for people in their most vulnerable moments. And the effects have been dire. Under private equity ownership, some ambulance response times worsened, heart monitors failed and companies slid into bankruptcy. In at least two cases, lawsuits contend, poor service led to patient deaths. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cities and towns have struggled to pay for public infrastructure and ambulance services since the financial crisis and private equity stepped in. At the same time, private equity firms have moved in where banks have scaled back their mortgage operations. The shift has happened with relatively little scrutiny, and now private equity firms are repeating the mistakes that banks made during the housing crisis, </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matthew Goldstein, Rachel Abrams and Ben Protess report. They are quick to foreclose on homeowners and are losing families' mortgage paperwork, much as the banks did. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these practices were enabled by the federal government, which sold tens of thousands of discounted mortgages to private equity investors, while making few demands on how they treated struggling homeowners. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times examined the largest private equity firms operating in the housing industry to assess their impact on homeowners and renters. <BR>Lone Star Funds' mortgage operation has aggressively pushed thousands of homeowners toward foreclosure. Nationstar Mortgage, which leaped over big banks to become the fourth-largest collector of mortgage bills, repeatedly lost loan files and failed to detect errors in other documents. Its mistakes put borrowers &quot;at significant risk of servicing and foreclosure abuses,&quot; according to regulatory records. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it invests in real estate, private equity also needs to compete for middle-market renters to serve pension fund investors that have come to expect strong returns. As a result, it tends to focus on suburban communities where relatively few people hold  federal subsidy vouchers.   &quot;These firms are going into markets which would have recovered anyway,&quot; said Alan Mallach,<BR>senior fellow at the Center for Community Progress, a nonprofit that advises communities on dealing with vacant and blighted homes. As a result, many of the working poor are being bypassed. </SPAN></P>
