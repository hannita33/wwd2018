</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The United States will be agnostic on human rights, freedom and democracy.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thing about &quot;The Apprentice&quot; is you could turn it off. Now we get to watch Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> all the time. There's nowhere to hide. I was in Papua New Guinea recently. His name kept coming up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appointments cascade at reality-show speed. Rick Perry to head the Energy Department whose name he couldn't remember when he wanted to dismantle it! Scott Pruitt to head the Environmental Protection Agency he's spent the last several years suing! A fierce critic of worker protections to be secretary of labor! An oil executive, Rex Tillerson, whose company owns drilling rights on 63.7 million acres in Russia to handle dealings with Vladimir Putin when Moscow just infiltrated the American election process!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next up: Kim Jong-un as press secretary, Cruella de Vil to head the Humane Society, and Mata Hari to lead the Cybersecurity National Action Plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this is further evidence of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> genius. He is master of the Art of Disorientation. He's turned Americans into cartoon characters whose heads are always spinning. How the president-elect must laugh at all the fact-based journalism (ghastly tautological phrase) dedicated to disproving things he never believed and can't remember anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disoriented are more inclined to seek saviors. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> knows that. He's been right up to now. Before anyone else, he was onto the way that direct democracy through social media has buried representative democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One minute it's &quot;millions&quot; of illegal votes for Hillary Clinton; then dangling little Mitt Romney; then being too smart for intelligence briefings. Let's face it, folks. We have no idea what is about to happen in the White House or at White House North in Midtown Manhattan. We are in whatever territory lies beyond unknown unknowns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some things may be emerging from the fog. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not interested in the rules-based international order the United States has spent the last seven decades building and defending. His foreign policy will be transactional. If it profits America, fine. If not, forget about it. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United States will be agnostic on human rights, freedom and democracy. America, suspending moral judgment, will behave a lot more like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the world stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except that's a little unfair to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The Chinese do understand the benefits of free trade (and they certainly understand that when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rips up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a strategic plan to offset Chinese power couched in an economic arrangement, Beijing grows stronger). Because they often can't breathe, the Chinese also understand, in a way </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not, the importance of fighting climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an exercise, I've been trying to imagine </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> saying something - anything - about the heinous destruction of Aleppo by the forces of Putin and Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. I've been trying to imagine what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might say about the brutal crimes against Syrian civilians in the beleaguered eastern sector of that once glorious city. I came up blank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did say it was &quot;sad.&quot; He said he'd ask Persian Gulf nations to put up money for &quot;safe zones.&quot; Good luck with that as the war nears its sixth year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess that's one advantage of the amorality in which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> traffics: You may as well refrain from any moral stand because nobody will believe you anyway. (To be fair, Syria is a huge stain on the Obama presidency.) It would be obscene for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to speak of principles. That is a problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America is an idea. Strip freedom, human rights, democracy and the rule of law from what the United States represents to the world and America itself is gutted. Of course, realpolitik driven by interests is integral to American foreign policy, but a valueless approach of the kind </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposes leaves the world rudderless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pax Americana is over. It had a good run. A Putin-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> alliance at the service of the butcher Assad - combined with the undoing of the military alliances, trade pacts, political integration and legal framework of the postwar order - constitutes its death knell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe everything will work out fine with a nuclear South Korea, a nuclear Japan, Baltic States exposed to the whims of Putin, the United States Embassy moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a flimsy NATO abjured by America, and swaggering Texan oil men running things while </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> takes time off in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I doubt it. The embassy move alone could ignite widespread violence. David Friedman, the man </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has nominated as ambassador to Israel, seems certain to stoke the fires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans are full of contradictions he hasn't begun to address. He's against the Iran nuclear deal although of course he's never read it. But Putin is for it. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to eliminate the Islamic State. So does Russia, whose ally in Syria is Iran. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants an America-first, business-driven policy. Boeing just signed a big deal with Iran. So maybe </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ends up doing the only sane thing: preserving a nuclear deal that's in everyone's interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who knows? Markets think they do. They love </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. That's because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> believes big guys should take everything and little guys should take nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But wasn't it the little guys who voted for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? That's funny, really it is. Or as he would put it, &quot;Sad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
