</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good evening. Here's the latest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is under fire for his choice of Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights groups, Democrats and some Republicans warn that Mr. Bannon, above at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower, represents racist and nationalist views.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kellyanne Conway, another adviser, defended Mr. Bannon as a &quot;brilliant tactician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bannon's former home, Breitbart News, meanwhile, is reveling in Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory and eyeing expansion. Critics say it could play an unprecedented role in a modern presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In Washington, President Obama stressed the importance of a peaceful transition. He described Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a &quot;pragmatist&quot; rather than an ideologue. He said he would encourage Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to allow immigrants who came as children to stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he set off on his last major foreign trip as president. The six-day journey will include stops in Greece, Germany and Peru, and meetings with European leaders, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president and Australia's prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House officials have said he is prepared to spend the trip talking about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since Election Day, there has been a wave of reports of bias attacks, harassment and vandalism. And the F.B.I. reported that hate crimes surged last year, led by attacks on Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many attacks have also been countered by acts of public support and solidarity, as in the case of the Iraqi family living in Maryland, above, after they found a threat taped to their door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he was surprised to hear that some of his supporters were making racial threats and told them to stop it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">___</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The International Criminal Court is considering a war-crimes investigation in Afghanistan, after a prosecutor said she had a &quot;reasonable basis to believe&quot; that American soldiers there committed war crimes, including torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. is not a party to the court, but Afghanistan is. So allegations of crimes committed in its territory are considered fair game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">___</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Interviews with more than two dozen medical personnel who served or consulted at the American military prison at Guant&aacute;namo Bay, Cuba, reveal how secrecy, mistrust and the shadow of interrogation limited doctors' ability to treat detainees who became mentally ill, some after being subjected to torture or other harsh coercive practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">___</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Gwen Ifill, the award-winning PBS journalist and debate moderator, died of cancer in Washington. She was 61.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She not only informed today's citizens, but she also inspired tomorrow's journalists,&quot; Mr. Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Ifill had a long career, reporting for NBC and The New York Times, and moderated the Democratic presidential primary debate between Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Since Cuba and the United States began to normalize relations two years ago, Cuba has become a destination for cancer patients seeking an immunotherapy vaccine developed there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozens of Americans suffering from lung cancer have slipped into Havana and smuggled vials of the drug Cimavax back home. And judging from online patients' forums, more are making plans to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Apple's new MacBook Pro is the latest generation of a laptop beloved by creative professionals and coders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's light and fast, but is not for everyone, our critic writes, given its sole type of connection port, an unhelpful Touch Bar and a big price tag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. There will be no female president come January. But in the days leading up to the election, there was a distinct possibility that this 227-year-old gender barrier would be breached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we asked women to tell us about their own vividly recalled barriers. Almost 1,200 responded. Here are some of their stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Michael Stipe is ready to return to music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since R.E.M. broke up five years ago, he has spent most of his time working on sculpture. But then he performed in tributes to David Bowie this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also got involved in the reissue of R.E.M.'s hit album &quot;Out of Time,&quot; coming Friday, which includes demos, an acoustic live recording and the record's eight ambitious music videos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Finally, when it comes to heart disease, terrible habits erase about half of the benefits of good genes, a new study found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thankfully, the phenomenon works the other way, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For people with a genetic risk of heart disease, healthy habits like abstaining from smoking, moderate exercise and a diet heavy in fruits, vegetables and grains are potent weapons to defy your DNA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">____</SPAN></P>
