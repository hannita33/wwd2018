<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON -- I've actually been watching the early </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency from London. (I would have gone to the moon, but I couldn't get a ride.) Even from here I have vertigo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My head is swirling from ''alternative facts,'' trade deals canceled, pipelines initiated, Obamacare in the Twilight Zone and utterly bizarre rants about attendance on Inauguration Day and fake voters on Election Day. Whatever this cost Vladimir Putin, he's already gotten his money's worth -- a chaos president. Pass the vodka. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But moderate Republicans, independents and Democrats who opposed Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> need to beware. He can make you so nuts -- he can so vacuum your brains out -- that you can't think clearly about the most important questions today: What things are true even if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> believes them, and therefore merit support? And where can Democrats offer smarter approaches on issues, like jobs, for instance -- approaches that can connect to the guts of working-class voters as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did, but provide a smarter path forward.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> instinct is not wrong is on the need to strike a better long-term trading arrangement with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But I worry about his pugnacious tactics. I would be negotiating with Beijing in total secret. Let everybody save face. If he smacks </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with ''America First,'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will smack him with ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First,'' and soon we'll have a good ol' trade war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Where I think Democrats should focus their critique, and fresh thinking, is how we actually bring back more middle-class jobs. A day barely goes by without </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> threatening some company that plans to move jobs abroad or build a factory in Mexico, not America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bullying can actually save good jobs, God bless him. But what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't see is that while this may get him some short-term jobs headlines, in the long-run C.E.O.s may prefer not to build their next factory in America, precisely because it will be hostage to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twitter lashings. They also may quietly replace more workers with robots faster, because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can't see or complain about that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to protect jobs,'' explained Gidi Grinstein, who heads the Israeli policy institute Reut. ''What we really need is to protect workers.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You need to protect workers, not jobs, because every worker today will most likely have to transition multiple times to multiple jobs as the pace of change accelerates. So the best way you help workers is by ensuring that they are flexible -- that they have the skills, safety nets, health care and lifelong learning opportunities to make those leaps and that they live in cities open to innovation, entrepreneurship and high-I.Q. risk-takers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The societal units protecting workers best are our healthy communities -- where local businesses, philanthropies, the public school system and universities, and local government come together to support a permanent education-to-work-to-life-long-skill-building pipeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Businesses signal to schools and colleges, in real time, the skills they need to thrive in the global economy, and philanthropies fund innovative programs for supplemental education and training. Schools also serve as adult learning and social service centers -- and local and state governments support them all, including reaching out globally for investors and new markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Eric Beinhocker, executive director of the Institute for New Economic Thinking at Oxford, calls this the ''new progressive localism.'' For too long, he argues, ''progressives have been so focused on Washington, they've missed the fact that most of the progress on the issues they care about -- environment, education, economic opportunity and work-force skills -- has happened at the local level. Because that is where trust lives.'' Trust is what enables you to adapt quickly and experiment often, i.e., to be flexible. And there is so much more trust on the local level than the national level in America today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strong-arms a company to retain jobs, but kills Obamacare without a credible alternative, he is saving jobs but hurting workers, because he is making workers less secure and less flexible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> jobs fallacies is that regulation always holds companies back. In some cases it does, and thoughtful deregulation can help. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> argument that we must ignore climate science because steadily upgrading clean energy standards for our power, auto and construction companies kills jobs is pure nonsense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fact: California has some of the highest clean energy standards for cars, buildings and electric utilities in America. And those standards have kept California one of the world's leaders in clean-tech companies and start-ups, and its jobs and overall economy have grown steadily since 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Golden State has more than half a million advanced energy jobs,'' says Energy Innovation C.E.O. Hal Harvey. ''That's 10 times more -- in this state alone -- than total U.S. coal jobs.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strategy is to ''make America last'' on clean energy and to double down on coal. Insane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In sum, Democrats should and can take the language of ''strength'' away from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and own it themselves. They should be for strong workers, not strong walls; for building strong communities, not relying on a strongman to strong-arm employers; and for strong standards to create strong companies. Those would be my fightin' words.</SPAN></P>
