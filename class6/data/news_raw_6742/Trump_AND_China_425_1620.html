<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is facing backlash over his choiceof Stephen K. Bannon as his administration's chief strategist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move elevates the hard-right nationalist movement Mr. Bannon nurtured while running Breitbart News, a website whose staples include articles linking migrants to the spread of disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site is expanding to Europe in time for coming elections in Germany and France, where it plans to support the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of racially charged assaults, graffiti messages and other episodes have surged in the U.S. since Election Day. Many have been countered by acts of public support and solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Obama took questions from reporters for the first time since the election, portraying Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as apragmatist and stressing the importance of a peaceful transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obamais on his way to Greece, where Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory has undermined hopes of securing debt relief by the end of the year. Mr. Obama has been supportive of such a deal, while Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he would &quot;stay back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continued to project his presidency onto the world stage, speaking by phone with Xi Jinping of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His meeting with Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party, was not welcomed by Prime Minister Theresa May, who insisted there would be no &quot;third person&quot; in her relationship with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even members of her own party say he could help repair U.S.-Britain relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E.U. talks continue today in Brussels over closer military cooperation in light of Britain's departure from the bloc and a possible isolationist turn in U.S. foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Hong Kong court ruled that two pro-independence politicians who were elected to the legislature cannot take their seats. Beijing issued a new interpretation of the territory's charter last week, effectively barring them from the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young legislators set off the conflict by using a derogatory term for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when they took their oaths of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anxiety over the election of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is pervading United Nations talks on climate change in Morocco, over his pledge to withdraw from the Paris climate deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists confirmed that 2016 was on course to be the hottest year on record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Global investors, expecting a free-spending </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency, are selling off government bonds and loading up on stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economic growth in the eurozone was at 0.3 percent in the third quarter of this year, in line with expectations. Germany reported a slowdown with growth at 0.2 percent, while Italy's economy expanded more than expected.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An Islamic State commander convicted of recruiting fighters has been arrested in Sudan with the help of Italian intelligence. [ANSA]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine reportedly did not declare ownership of a luxury villa in Spain despite his government's much-publicized campaign asking officials to declare their assets. [Radio Free Europe]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Chinese astronauts expect to leave their space lab this week, after a monthlong stay that is a first for their nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has poured billions of dollars into its space program, aiming to rival the United States and Russia in reaching Mars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such programs are enormous drivers of technological innovation. So it might come as a surprise to know that space communications rely on an old standby: radio waves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speech from an astronaut, video from cameras and data from sensors flow into a transmitter, which emits radio waves picked up by a terrestrial receiver. Terrestrial transmitters reverse the favor. The same basic technology sends music to your radio, YouTube videos to your cellphone and photos from Pluto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There really isn't any alternative until we figure out how to use lasers to convey data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's been a lot of fine-tuning of radio capabilities over the 125 years or so that scientists have been playing with electromagnetic radiation. We have great antennas and efficient, secure encoding now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the technology is also good for a simple call from home. Last week, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, Xi Jinping, called the space lab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone across </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cares very much about both of you,&quot; Mr. Xi said. One astronaut proudly said, &quot;I will go forth, and successfully complete the mission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
