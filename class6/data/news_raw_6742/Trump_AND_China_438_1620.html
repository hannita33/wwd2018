</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">968 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;How can we tell where the new administration is heading?<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone who tells you, with perfect confidence, what a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration will do is either bluffing or a fool. We have a prospective cabinet and a White House staff, but we haven't got the first idea how the two will fit together or relate to Congress, or how the man at the top will preside over it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we can do, for now, is set up a matrix to help assess the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> era as it proceeds, in which each appointment and policy move gets plotted along two axes. The first axis, the X-axis, represents possibilities for Trumpist policy, the second, the Y-axis, scenarios for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> approach to governance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy axis runs from full populism at one end to predictable conservative orthodoxy on the other. A full populist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency would give us tariffs and trade wars, an infrastructure bill that would have Robert Moses doing back flips, a huge wall and E-Verify and untouched entitlements and big tax cuts for the middle class. On foreign policy it would be Henry Kissinger meets Andrew Jackson: D&eacute;tente with Russia, no nation-building anywhere, and a counterterrorism strategy that shoots, bombs and drones first and asks questions later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an orthodox-conservative </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency, on the other hand, congressional Republicans would run domestic policy and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would simply sign their legislation: A repeal of Obamacare without an obvious replacement, big tax cuts for the rich, and the Medicare reform of Paul Ryan's fondest dreams. On foreign policy, it would offer hawkishness with a dose of idealistic rhetoric - meaning brinkmanship with the Russians, not a rapprochement, plus military escalation everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second axis, the possibilities for how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> governs, runs from ruthless authoritarianism at one end to utter chaos at the other. Under the authoritarian scenario, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would act on all his worst impulses with malign efficiency. The media would be intimidated, Congress would be gelded, the F.B.I. and the I.R.S. would go full J. Edgar Hoover against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> enemies, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family would enrich itself fantastically - and then, come a major terrorist attack, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would jail or intern anyone he deemed a domestic enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the other end of this axis, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his team would be too stumbling and hapless to effectively oppress anyone, and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> era would just be a rolling disaster - with frequent resignations, ridiculous scandals, Republicans distancing themselves, the deep state in revolt, the media circling greedily, and any serious damage done by accident rather than design.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition - the process, the appointees, the tweets - can be charted along both axes. On policy, much of his cabinet falls closer to the conventional conservative end, with appointees like Tom Price and Betsy DeVos and Rick Perry who would be at home in a Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio or even Jeb! administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, some of his cabinet picks are a little more ideologically unknowable (like Steven Mnuchin at Treasury), and his inner circle remains highly unconventional. Stephen K. Bannon is intent on remaking the G.O.P. along nationalist lines, Jared Kushner and Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seem eager for their paterfamilias to negotiate with Democrats, Peter Navarro is girding for a trade war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China. And Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign policy choices - especially Rex Tillerson at State - seem closer to full-Trumpist realpolitik than to Reaganism-as-usual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the governance axis, the president-elect's strong-arming of the private sector, his media-bashing tweets, and his feud with the intelligence community all hint at an authoritarian timeline ahead. Likewise, other fact patterns - that Congressional Republicans are mostly supine, that the stock market has surged - suggest that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could be authoritarian, corrupt and politically effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But anyone who fears incompetence more than tyranny has plenty of evidence as well. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweets might be a sign, not of an incipient autocrat, but of an unstable narcissist who will undermine himself at every step. He has no cushion in popular opinion: If things go even somewhat badly, his political capital will go very fast indeed. He has plenty of hacks, wild cards and misfit toys occupying positions of real responsibility - and his White House has already had its first sex scandal!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, finally, there is the question of how the axes interact. A populist-authoritarian combination might seem natural, with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> using high-profile deviations from conservative orthodoxy to boost his popularity even as he runs roughshod over republican norms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But you could also imagine an authoritarian-orthodox conservative combination, in which Congressional Republicans accept the most imperial of presidencies because it's granting them tax rates and entitlement reforms they have long desired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or you could imagine a totally incompetent populism, in which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> flies around the country holding rallies while absolutely nothing in Washington gets done ... or a totally incompetent populism that ultimately empowers conventional conservatism, because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decides that governing isn't worth it and just lets Paul Ryan run the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for what we should actually hope for - well, the midpoint of each axis, the center of the matrix, seems like the sweet spot for the country: A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency that's competent-enough without being dictatorial, and that provides a needed populist corrective to conservatism without taking us all the way to mercantilism or a debt crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this is Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> we're talking about, so a happy medium seems unlikely. Along one axis or the other, bet on the extremes.</SPAN></P>
