<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Fitton is president of Judicial Watch, a conservative nonprofit that promotes government transparency and accountability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, Judicial Watch has called out many White House conflicts of interest. We fought in court against President Bill Clinton's taking money to pay his legal bills through a legal-defense fund. During the George W. Bush administration, we questioned the propriety of his father, President George H.W. Bush, working for Carlyle Group, an investment company that was, in effect, a major defense contractor. We also investigated and sued over the connections between another defense contractor, Halliburton, and Vice President Dick Cheney, the company's former C.E.O. We highlighted in 2014 how Bill Clinton was getting unusually large six-figure speaking fees from foreign governments while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could face some very serious conflict of interest problems of his own. He acknowledged as much recently when he tweeted out plans for a ''major news conference'' on Thursday, since postponed, to explain how he intended to leave behind his ''great business in total to fully focus on running the country.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a tweet on Monday, he promised without elaborating that ''no new deals will be done'' by his business while he is president. This sounds interesting. Americans should expect that the new president will take reasonable steps to separate his public office from his personal business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it would be unfair to insist that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> destroy his business to become president. This would create a dangerous precedent that would, in effect, deter those who had succeeded in their private lives from bringing their substantial skills to the public arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said recently that he intended to allow his family to take the helm after he assumes office. ''I've built a very great company and it's a big company and it's all over the world,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, adding, ''I don't care about my company. It doesn't matter. My kids run it.'' But of course it does matter; otherwise, he would liquidate his businesses, put the proceeds in a blind trust, send the kids out to find new jobs, and be done with the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Given the potential for conflicts, it makes sense for the American people to demand assurances that the public interest won't be harmed by the continued operation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. So, what to do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  First, let's not pretend that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> children will not be conflicted in running the company for their father. That is why Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should formalize his complete separation from his company and stop working on any aspect of his business. He should draw no pay. And, difficult as it may be, he should vow not to discuss any aspect of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business empire with his children -- or any other </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and those at the company's helm should commit to full transparency by making public any contracts with any federal agency, foreign government or foreign corporation. Our nation's enemies, and some of our friends, will seek to either curry favor with or damage America through the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> businesses. By providing full transparency, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his family can show that they take seriously that, as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has tweeted, it is ''visually important, as president, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It would be in the company's best interest to set up an internal watchdog to help develop procedures that could help avoid conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Judicial Watch has already analyzed a number of current foreign entanglements that will require Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his family to demonstrate thorough transparency:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a frequent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> target on the campaign trail, the government-controlled Bank of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is part of a group that lent a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-affiliated office building in Manhattan $950 million. In India, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business partners are building luxury apartment complexes. Three Indian developers flew to New York recently and met with the president-elect. And in Germany, troubled Deutsche Bank has been involved in $3.5 billion in loans to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> entities since 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These connections would create more than enough controversy for most administrations. So it would be a good practice for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> progeny to avoid any new foreign entanglements. The Constitution's Emoluments Clause bars the president from earning any compensation from a foreign government. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ought to consider a partial disinvestment from his company by either selling outright or rejecting the proceeds of any stakes with foreign government partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He should refuse any third party contributions to his personal foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Above all, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration should be completely transparent on any government dealings with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> empire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His refusal to release his tax returns is another issue that will dog him. The law doesn't require Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to release them, and he has been advised by his lawyer not to do so while he is under audit. It would obviously be good transparency and good politics to make them public. But critics should take seriously how the release of the confidential tax information could damage the company and the family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the best of circumstances, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family business and questions about conflicts will be a burden to his presidency. There is no off-the-shelf ethics plan that would cover every possible conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Judicial Watch, and the left's planned Judicial Watch imitators, will monitor this issue. If he mishandles his devolvement from his business, he may tarnish his presidency. It would be ironic if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business success put his political and business legacy at risk.</SPAN></P>
