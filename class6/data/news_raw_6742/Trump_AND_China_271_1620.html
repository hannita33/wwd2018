<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Marco Rubio, alarmed by Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ascendancy and worried that his presidential chances were slipping away, unleashed a barrage of attacks on the real estate mogul's business ethics, hiring practices and financial achievements in Thursday's debate, forcefully delivering the onslaught that Republican leaders had desperately awaited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a series of acid exchanges, a newly pugnacious Mr. Rubio, long mocked for a robotic and restrained style, interrupted Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, quizzed him, impersonated him, shouted over him and left him looking unsettled. It was an unfamiliar reversal of roles for the front-runner, who found himself so frequently the target of assaults from Mr. Rubio and Senator Ted Cruz that he complained they must have been a ploy for better television ratings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the opening moments of the debate, Mr. Rubio pounced. Deploying his own up-by-the-bootstraps biography, the Florida senator assailed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for hiring hundreds of foreign workers at his tony resort in Florida and passing over Americans who had applied for the same jobs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''My mom was a maid in a hotel,'' Mr. Rubio said. ''And instead of hiring an American like her, you've brought over 1,000 people from all over the world to fill in those jobs instead.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moments later, Mr. Rubio moved to cast Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a huckster who outsourced the manufacturing of the clothing that bears his name to countries like Mexico and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> even as he promised to wage a trade war against those countries. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tried to protest, Mr. Rubio interrupted right back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Make them in America!'' he demanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The acerbic and urgent tenor of the exchanges reflected the panicked state of a Republican field determined to halt Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whose crudely freewheeling style, abundant self-assuredness and durable popularity have produced three consecutive early-state victories that threaten to put the nomination out of reach for his two biggest rivals, Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The two-hour rumpus frequently devolved into unmediated bouts of shouting, name-calling and pleas to the moderators for chances to respond to the latest insult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This guy's a choke artist,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declared, pointing to Mr. Rubio. ''This guy's a liar,'' he said, swiveling toward Mr. Cruz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The timing of Thursday's debate in Houston, days before 595 delegates are awarded in voting across the country on March 1, made it among the most anticipated and consequential debates of the Republican campaign season and the first to feature a shrunken field of five candidates. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After resounding defeats at the hands of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the past two primaries, both Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz walked onto the stage confronting treacherous paths ahead and a pressing dilemma: whether to keep trying to destroy each other, their comfort zone in past debates, or to aim their fire at Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They chose war with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But amid the relentless back and forth, a question hovered: Was it too late? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It did not seem so, as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> usual bravado gave way to a less nimble performance. After a tense exchange with Mr. Cruz over the depth of their conservatism and fidelity to the Constitution, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> awkwardly asked for an apology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Cruz refused, instead seizing on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Donald, I will not apologize for one minute for defending the Constitution,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The audience broke into applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Given the intractability of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> support and the cruel mathematics of capturing the nomination, it was unclear whether his shakiness in the debate would blunt his momentum, especially with his impressive lead in several key states that will vote over the next few days. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But for a single night, it seemed, the dynamic among the candidates shifted, not only because Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeared off-balance at times, but because his rivals seemed looser, more comfortable and even delighted to take him on. Mr. Rubio smiled as he issued biting dissections of the less savory chapters of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business history and even questioned the very essence of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> success story, saying he was simply the heir to a vast fortune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be right now? Selling watches in Manhattan?'' Mr. Rubio said, as the audience erupted in laughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That is so wrong,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, plaintively. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When, at another point, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that Mr. Rubio did not know ''anything about business,'' the senator responded: ''I don't know anything about bankrupting four companies,'' an allusion to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> liberal use of bankruptcy protections over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Mr. Rubio, the night seemed to be something of a revival, allowing him to turn the most painful moment of his campaign into an effective tactic against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Earlier this month, he repeated himself four times in a disastrous debate-night run-in with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. On Thursday night, as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gave only a vague description of his health care proposals, Mr. Rubio gave him the Christie treatment. ''What's your plan?'' he taunted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke repeatedly about increasing competition among states -- ''You'll have many, they'll compete, and it'll be a beautiful thing'' -- Mr. Rubio observed, ''Now he's repeating himself,'' to raucous applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tried to regain control, saying: ''Talk about repeating. I watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it was Mr. Rubio who had the last word. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I saw you repeat yourself five times five seconds ago,'' he zinged, laughing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rubio's performance appeared to be pitched most directly at skeptical party elites and donors, who are banking on him as an alternative to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and have grown increasingly impatient watching his sometimes passive performances. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, on the other hand, seemed to be making a broader appeal to the hearts of Republican and independent voters as he heaped praise on former President George Bush, who sat in the audience with his wife, Barbara Bush, by his side. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kasich infused his message with sympathy for the downtrodden and overlooked, and offered a surprising olive branch to gay voters, saying he was uncomfortable with restrictions, advocated by conservatives, that would allow businesses to deny service to same-sex couples who wish to wed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Today, I'm not going to sell to somebody who's gay, and tomorrow, maybe I won't sell to somebody who's divorced,'' Mr. Kasich said. ''I mean, if you're in the business of commerce, conduct commerce. That's my view.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kasich, who faces pressure to quit the race to clear a path for either Mr. Cruz or Mr. Rubio, showed no signs of relenting as he appealed to the party's sense of civility and fondly recalled Mr. Bush's collaboration with President Ronald Reagan on immigration in the 1980s. ''It was,'' he said, ''a time when things worked.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon whose once-promising candidacy has fizzled, leaving him on the far edges of the campaign and the debate stage, used his rare moment in the spotlight on Thursday to complain once again about how little attention he was receiving. ''I'm going to whine,'' he said languorously, scolding a moderator, Hugh Hewitt, for not asking him about subjects ranging from Israel to taxes. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the pattern of the evening was the relentlessness of the attacks on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who appeared to become fatigued and defensive as the evening wore on. He faced questions about releasing his tax returns, days after Mitt Romney suggested they would include a ''bombshell.'' Mr. Hewitt noted that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had promised on his show last year that he would do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''First of all, very few people listen to your radio show,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said snappishly. ''That's the good news.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he would be glad to release his returns, but claimed he could not do so yet because ''we're under a routine audit'' -- a plight he attributed to ''the size of my company, which is very, very large.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That provided an opening for yet another chaotic pile-on from the senators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Luckily, I'm not being audited this year,'' Mr. Rubio said puckishly. ''Or last year, for that matter.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Cruz added: ''Donald says he's being audited. I would think that would underscore the need to release those returns.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both senators said they planned to release tax documents in the coming days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Near the end, the debate disintegrated into an almost comedic cascade of cross-talk and confusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Cruz urged Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to ''relax.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called Mr. Cruz ''a basket case.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Don't get nervous,'' he told Mr. Cruz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a sign that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aura of invulnerability, at least for the evening, was in doubt, Mr. Cruz quipped, ''I promise you, Donald, there's nothing about you that makes anyone nervous.''</SPAN></P>
