<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goodbye to all that. Now we know that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would rip up the post-1945 world order, trash an ''obsolete'' NATO, lean toward a Japan with nukes rather than the ''one-sided agreement'' that leaves the United States responsible for Japanese defense, tell Saudi Arabia that it ''wouldn't be around for very long'' without American protection, and generally make clear that ''we cannot be the policeman of the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So much for Pax Americana; it was a bad deal, you see, and in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> universe the deal is everything. American power and far-flung American garrisons may have underwritten global security and averted nuclear war for more than seven decades, but they cannot be sustained by the ''poor country'' the United States has become. Why? Because, he insists, the whole postwar setup is a scam. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could be the next president of the United States is no longer a fanciful notion. Americans don't want business as usual; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not business as usual. He's ranting and schmoozing his way to the White House as the man who, through some alchemy, will make an anxious America proud again. The world -- already more combustible than at any time in recent decades -- may be about to become a much more dangerous place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in interviews with my colleagues Maggie Haberman and David Sanger, said: ''We have been disrespected, mocked and ripped off for many, many years by people that were smarter, shrewder, tougher. We were the big bully, but we were not smartly led.'' America was ''systematically ripped off by everybody. From </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to Japan to South Korea to the Middle East, many states in the Middle East, for instance protecting Saudi Arabia and not being properly reimbursed for every penny that we spend.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bottom line of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign policy: ''We will not be ripped off anymore'' because ''we don't have any money.'' He would like to see the United States ''really starting to go robust,'' as it did around 1900.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A lot of what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said was just plain wrong. He declared that he was ''all for Ukraine, I have friends that live in Ukraine,'' but those friends don't seem to have explained what's going on. He is irked because countries like Germany ''didn't seem to be very much involved'' when Russia got ''very confrontational'' (a.k.a. annexed Crimea and started a war in eastern Ukraine), and so the burden fell on the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, Germany has taken a central role in orchestrating sanctions against Russia and, unlike the United States, is at the table in the Minsk peace process for Ukraine. Perhaps it's unsurprising that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dismisses Germany's role in that he believes Europe's most powerful nation by far is ''being destroyed'' by ''tremendous crime'' (presumably on the part of unmentioned Muslim refugees) and by Chancellor Angela Merkel's ''na&iuml;vet&eacute; or worse'' (presumably in letting said Syrian refugees in). He also believes that the United States is ''obsolete in cyber,'' a view Iran would not share, and that ''our country doesn't have money'' (it does have some).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and facts are uneasy partners is already well known. What was not so apparent before these interviews was how radical a President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be in dismantling the architecture of postwar stability -- unless, of course, he changed his mind to demonstrate the unpredictability he prizes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To say NATO is obsolete -- a view Moscow has been pressing since the end of the Cold War as a means to get the United States out of Europe -- at a time when President Vladimir Putin is determined to assert Russian power is dangerous folly. Ask the Baltic States that have been spared Putin's aggression only because they are now NATO members. NATO remains the pillar of the trans-Atlantic cooperation that forged a Europe whole and free from the ruins and divisions of 1945.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To countenance a nuclear-armed Japan at a time when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rapid rise and designs in the East </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea have sharpened tensions between the two countries is also to play a high-risk game. The presence of the United States as an Asian power offsetting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rise and reassuring smaller nations in the hemisphere is a principal reason that rise has been peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As for the disintegration of Saudi Arabia, which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seems ready to accept if the Saudis don't step up to the plate financially and militarily, it may well make Syria look like a playground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is right about one thing. The world of 2016 is not that of 1945 or 1990. The United States is relatively weaker, power is shifting, there are pressing domestic priorities. But his version of ''America First'' -- which interestingly converges with the views of many on the left who are convinced that the United States should stop policing the world -- looks like a recipe for cataclysm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  War in Estonia or the East </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea could end up being a very bad deal indeed, a real rip-off for all humanity.</SPAN></P>
