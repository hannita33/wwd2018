</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the foreseeable future, no relationship is more vital to international stability than that between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Yet Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Chinese authorities have foolishly introduced dangerous new uncertainties into the equation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> resolved a potential crisis on Tuesday by returning an underwater research drone that it had seized on Dec. 15 from a United States Navy ship in international waters near the Philippines. Still, the episode stoked fresh tensions and gave Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> an excuse to double down on his campaign promise to adopt a tougher and less predictable line toward Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began this month by taking a postelection phone call from the presidentof Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, and a week later suggested that he might jettison the United States' longstanding acceptance of a &quot;one-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; policy. It's unclear what Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> means by this, or if he understands the threat that a breakdown in relations would pose for Taiwan, an American partner, as well for broader American interests in Asia. Or maybe he understands and just doesn't care.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maintaining a delicate balance on Taiwan's status has been a foundational principle of United States-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relations and crucial to maintaining peace in Asia. Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade region that will eventually be incorporated in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, by force if necessary. Since 1978, the United States has recognized Beijing as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sole government, breaking diplomatic ties with Taiwan a year later, but Washington continues to have unofficial ties with Taiwan, sells weapons to the self-governing island, and has hinted it may defend Taiwan if it is attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told Fox News recently that he might reconsider the one-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy as a way to exact Chinese concessions in disputes over currency manipulations, trade and Beijing's moves to claim rocks and reefs in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. He may think he is making an opening bid, but for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Taiwan's status is nonnegotiable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such talk, some experts fear, might mean that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would formally recognize Taiwan or embolden Taiwan to declare independence from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, either of which would bring swift reprisals. Alternatively, some worry that if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> offers the right deal, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might abandon Taiwan by ending cooperation and billions of dollars in arms sales. Such a shift would shake the foundations of every international alliance and partnership the United States has spent decades building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the world's second-largest economy, is America's largest trading partner, besides being a nuclear power and a veto-wielding member of the United Nations Security Council. Heedless of these concerns, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has threatened to slap 45 percent tariffs on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and start a trade war that would penalize American consumers, who would have to pay more for imported Chinese goods. It would also hurt American businesses that seek to sell their products in the Chinese market. Beijing has already thrown a punch, warning last week that it could place sanctions against General Motors or Ford for monopolistic behavior, possibly as a response to an unfavorable shift in American policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are plenty of ways for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to retaliate, from breaking off diplomatic relations if the United States formally recognizes Taiwan to buying planes from Europe's Airbus instead of Boeing, to refusing to help curb North Korea's nuclear program. There could also be more shows of force like the Chinese fighter jets that flew close to Taiwan late last month. And </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could also restrict its investments and tourism to Taiwan, which would not be good for the island or the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not uncommon for new presidents to put their own stamp on policy, even longstanding policy. But this requires assembling a staff and conducting a full review of the impact of any changes. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has few Asia experts in his circle, and some advisers have urged him to take up a hard line without any sense of long-term repercussions in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama tried to manage a more assertive </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by pursuing deeper military cooperation with smaller Asian nations and negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation agreement setting higher standards for trade. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has firmly rejected that deal, with no interest in renegotiating it. His early moves show only his intent to be a disrupter, no matter the consequences to American security.</SPAN></P>
