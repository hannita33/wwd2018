<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEXICO CITY -- Vicente Fox, the former president of Mexico, was recently stuck in Mexico City traffic, overcome with frustration -- not by the congestion, but by something that was irritating him even more: Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He grabbed his phone, turned the lens on himself and pressed record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Ha! Donald,'' Mr. Fox said, holding the phone perhaps a little too close to his face. ''What about your apologies to Mexico, to Mexicans in the United States, to Mexicans in Mexico?'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In short order, the 15-second clip was on Mr. Fox's Twitter feed -- another salvo in a personal campaign against the American presidential candidate that has included television appearances, radio interviews and a fusillade of hectoring Twitter posts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Fox's voice is among a growing, if uncoordinated, chorus of influential Mexicans worried about what a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory could mean for the complex relationship between the United States and Mexico -- not to mention the impact Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidential bid may have already had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The voices have included at least two former Mexican presidents, top government officials, political analysts, academics, editorial writers and cultural figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto likened the candidate's language to that of Hitler and Mussolini in an interview with Mexico's Excelsior newspaper. And he recently shuffled his diplomatic corps in the United States, replacing Mexico's ambassador to Washington and installing new consuls general around the country, in part to strengthen his administration's response to the rise of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and what it reflects about American sentiment toward Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While many leaders around the world are worried about how Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign, win or lose, could shape American foreign policy, the concerns are particularly pointed in Mexico and throughout the Mexican diaspora because of the exceptionally close geographic, economic, demographic and cultural ties between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The two countries are now enjoying one of the more harmonious periods in a turbulent history. But many in Mexico fear that the friendship would rupture should Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> win the election and follow through on his threats to undo the North American Free Trade Agreement, force Mexico to pay for the construction of a wall between the countries by interrupting remittances and deport the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, about half of whom are Mexican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''His threat is cataclysmic, I think, for Mexico,'' Enrique Krauze, a Mexican historian and literary magazine editor, said in an interview. ''What it would mean for bilateral trade, in social terms, in the tearing of families, in the trauma, the collective panic, the opening of old wounds.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added: ''I can use one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> favorite words. Yes, this is huge. It's a huge danger.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mexican critics of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> say he has already damaged the image of their country and of the Mexican people with his espousal of views that many regard as xenophobic. At a rally to kick off his campaign in June, the Republican candidate suggested that many Mexican immigrants were drug traffickers and rapists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mexican officials, concerned about negative impressions of Mexico in the United States, have been rolling out a strategy to improve the image of their country and show how the relationship between the two nations has been of ''mutual benefit,'' said Paulo Carre&ntilde;o, the newly appointed under secretary for North America in Mexico's Foreign Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The strategy includes ''cultural diplomacy,'' grass-roots activism and the deployment of Mexican community and business leaders living in the United States, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As part of the strategy, the Pe&ntilde;a Nieto administration shook up its diplomatic corps in the United States last month: The Mexican ambassador to Washington, Miguel Bas&aacute;&ntilde;ez Ebergenyi, who had been in the job less than a year, was abruptly replaced by Carlos Sada Solana, a veteran diplomat. In addition, 26 consulates changed leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A statement from the Foreign Ministry announcing Mr. Sada's appointment emphasized his experience ''protecting the rights of Mexicans in North America, as well as defending the interests of Mexican abroad.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition, a few high-level government officials have reacted publicly to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including Humberto Roque Villanueva, the Interior Ministry's under secretary for population, migration and migratory affairs. He told the newspaper El Universal this month that the Mexican government was analyzing ''how to confront what we would call the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> emergency.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I believe Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> speaks off the top of his head and doesn't have a clear idea about financial matters or international accords,'' he added. ''We live in a globalized world. The United States would have to return to a kind of Middle Ages to prohibit remittances or charge tariffs that aren't charged in other parts of the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In general, however, the administration has mostly refrained from commenting on the candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That has frustrated many Mexicans, who have called on the government to come to the defense of Mexico and push back at Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> more forcefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They can package that in the traditional Mexican nonsense: We don't interfere in elections,'' said Jorge Casta&ntilde;eda, a former foreign minister. ''The real reason is that they have no idea what to do, so the default option is to do nothing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, most of the Mexican agitation against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has come from the general public. At the beginning of his campaign, many Mexicans viewed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a mixture of alarm and amusement. But the amusement has mostly fallen away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Why should we worry?'' Mr. Krauze asked, rhetorically. ''I couldn't think of a reason not to worry, no?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the fall, Mr. Krauze and Carmelo Mesa-Lago, an emeritus professor of economics and Latin American studies at the University of Pittsburgh, drafted a letter denouncing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign. Sixty-seven prominent Latinos -- academics, scientists, writers and filmmakers in the United States, Spain and Latin America -- signed it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''His hate speech appeals to lower passions like xenophobia, machismo, political intolerance and religious dogmatism,'' the letter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent months, Mr. Casta&ntilde;eda has been pushing a pro-Mexico social media campaign with the hashtag #ImProudToBeMexican. Aiming at an American, English-speaking audience, he has uploaded videos to Facebook and a campaign website extolling the diversity of the Mexican diaspora and its contributions to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Explaining the American focus of this lobby, he said: ''I don't want to convince Mexicans how nasty </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is, because everyone knows that. That's a done deal.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Fox's drumbeat of harangues against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began in February when he declared in a television interview, using a forceful expletive, that Mexicans would not build the candidate's proposed wall. He escalated from there, chiding Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with language that sometimes devolved into schoolyard churlishness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He called the candidate ''a false prophet,'' ''dictator'' and ''loser.'' He posted a selfie taken against the backdrop of a beach with this message: ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, this beautiful Cancun. YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE.'' He posted photos from his wife's birthday party, taunting Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: ''What do you know about love? Or you just know about hating. How sad!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This month, Mr. Fox expressed contrition for some of his comments in an interview with Breitbart News and apologized to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But amid blowback from Mexicans on social media and elsewhere who accused him of weakness, he resumed his badgering, posting photos on social media of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-brand tie made in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-brand jacket made in Mexico -- evidence, he said, of the candidate's hypocrisy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Fox said in a telephone interview from his home in Guanajuato State that he was motivated to attack Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by what he called ''pure love for that great nation, the United States.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I don't understand why the American public is buying this,'' he continued, pain in his voice. ''We are partners, we are neighbors, and we should be friends. He's dividing not only American society, but he's dividing two nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Why does he pick on Mexico?''</SPAN></P>
