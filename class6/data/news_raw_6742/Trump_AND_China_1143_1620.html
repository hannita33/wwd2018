</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Syria, lines of buses and ambulances began ferrying people out of the ravaged city of Aleppo after a twice-stalled evacuation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fall of the city could become one of President Bashar al-Assad's greatest victories. Rebels now control just one provincial capital, Idlib.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what will happen in Idlib, but if there is no cease-fire or political accord then it will become the next Aleppo,&quot; said Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations envoy for Syria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Russian hackers, including those behind the recent attacks intended to disrupt the U.S. presidential election, are hard to find, and thanks to Moscow's protections, even harder to prosecute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration said it delayed blaming Russia for a cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee until Oct. 7 over concerns that any statement by the president would be viewed as politicizing intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cast doubt on the government's conclusion that Russia carried out the cyberattack to further his campaign with the Kremlin's approval, falsely claiming that the Obama administration did not raise the issue until after the Nov. 8 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a summit in Brussels, European leaders agreed to extend economic sanctions against Russia until mid-2017. They also attempted to rescue a free-trade deal with Ukraine by addressing Dutch concerns over immigration and security guarantees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain tried to downplay a top diplomat's leaked warning that the country's departure from the E.U. could take 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 22-year-old white supremacist who admitted to a racial attack that stunned the U.S. was found guilty on a multitude of charges of hate crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dylann Roof, who fatally shot nine black parishioners in South Carolina last year, awaits sentencing by the same jury in a few weeks, either to life in prison without parole or death.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traces of explosives were found on some of the 66 victims of the crash in May of EgyptAir Flight 804, the strongest indication yet that a bomb took the plane down. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diving with disco balls. Shimmering orbs of sardines appeared off the Philippine coast a decade ago. The grouping tactic confuses predators and delights tourists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And a plea from our wine critic: Don't dismiss the big Champagne brands. They make great wine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where are the female composers of the last century?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what a reader asked after seeing a big gap on the list we put together to accompany a story on the first opera by a woman produced at the Metropolitan Opera in over 100 years (the Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho's &quot;L'Amour de Loin&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to see you fill in that century with the modernist female composers we know are there!&quot; the reader urged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our classical music editor, Zachary Woolfe, was happy to comply:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadia Boulanger (1887-1979), a famous teacher who was called &quot;a one-woman graduate school,&quot; composed exquisite songs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of her contemporaries, Ruth Crawford Seeger (1901-53), produced an excitingly wild, searching String Quartet. She also raised a family of folk singers that included her stepson, Pete Seeger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pauline Oliveros, who died last month at 84, explored sensory awareness through what she called &quot;deep listening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there's the Russian composer Sofia Gubaidulina, who was born in 1931. She's still writing thorny, spiritually deep orchestral works. A Times critic once referred to her as a &quot;tightrope walker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Yoko Ono, born in 1933, is best known for, well, other things, but she was also a conceptual composer out of the Fluxus school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a playlist of works by women currently composing. Enjoy.</SPAN></P>
