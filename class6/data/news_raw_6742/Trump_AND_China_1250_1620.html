</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Economic Forum opened its annual meeting of the world's richest and most powerful in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday against the backdrop of spreading revolts against global elites. The question now is whether these gilded champions of globalization will choose to address inequality or proceed with the business of wining and dining as usual.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if to underline the stakes, on the day the Davos meeting began, Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain delivered a speech in London outlining her country's exit from the European Union. The meeting will end on the day Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - who has cheered the breakup of the European Union, threatened to undo trade agreements and called climate change a Chinese hoax against the United States - is sworn in as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, it was President Xi Jinping, the first Chinese leader to attend the Davos meeting, who addressed the American and British retreats directly. &quot;The problems troubling the world are not caused by globalization,&quot; Mr. Xi told the forum. As for climate change, he urged that &quot;signatories should stick to&quot; the Paris climate agreement. Though he never mentioned Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by name, the target of his remarks was clear. &quot;As the Chinese saying goes,&quot; he said, &quot;people with petty shrewdness attend to trivial matters, while people with vision attend to governance of institutions.&quot; Ouch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Xi's remarks should serve as a sobering warning about the stakes of walking away from the grand visions that have guided American foreign policy since the end of World War II. But they also reflect the reality that emerging economies - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is still a developing country - across Asia and Africa are counting on hitching their economic engines to a fairly brokered global economy, and that they will face the worst effects of climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global inequality has grown to the point that just eight of the planet's richest people now hold wealth equal to that of the poorest half of the world population. Bill Gates, the richest man in the world, with a personal net worth of over $84 billion, is attending this year's Davos meeting, where sessions on inequality underscore the worries about populist revolt. Also on the agenda is a preoccupation from last year that automation will soon put millions of people out of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Davos to be more than a punch line about the wealthy, it will have to address the pains of globalization head on and do better than its usualplatitudesabout building &quot;a dynamic, inclusive multi-stakeholder global-governance system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
