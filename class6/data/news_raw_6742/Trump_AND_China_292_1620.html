</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Parting, a reader in Germany, wrote that a Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency could mend ties between the United States and Russia, which would &quot;overall reduce the potential for international conflicts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nadim Kobeissi, a Lebanese immigrant living in France, said he feared personal ramifications from the election of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My partner and I, both Arab immigrants, already witness enough xenophobia, and there is a fear that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory only further legitimizes this sort of discourse around the world,&quot; he wrote to The Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We asked our readers outside of the United States to tell us how the election might affect their family and country. We received more than 800 responses. Nearly every region of the world was represented, but almost 40 percent came from Western Europe and almost 20 percent from Canada.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large group of readers focused on how the new administration would affect trade and their nation's - and family's - economic prospects. Many others discussed security issues. And some people of color and women raised questions about how Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inflammatory language might change discourse worldwide and possibly lead to more hate crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is a selection of the responses; they have been edited and condensed, and some have been translated into English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security and Aid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> antiterror policies might give Pakistan a jolt and help us curb terror and save many hundreds of lives that are lost to these terrorists from across the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kartikey, India</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The impact shall be likely on the scaling down of humanitarian aid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simon Ruwuke Hove, Zimbabwe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the most tangible is that we as NATO allies should start to take our own security more serious. I believe that is only fair, so we should prepare to pay our share of the bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Hendrikx, the Netherlands</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it comes to relations to Russia, which are a bit tense, I'm quite sure </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is better than Clinton. In my opinion the attitude toward Russia has been way too negative here in Europe. Of course, there are a lot of problems with Russia not being a democracy and all, but that big country in the East has been in far worse condition and extremely more dangerous in the past than it is now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sven Jans, Sweden</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope he can apply his skill in bullying people this time for good - and his own place in history - by getting Netanyahu and the Palestinians to make peace for their people's future and the world's stability. My husband, son and daughter have served in the army; I hope my grandchildren will never be in danger in the same way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elinore Liebersohn Koenigsfeld, Israel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am deeply concerned with president-elect Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for obvious reasons, but I am honestly relieved that Ms. Clinton couldn't get the job. Her foreign policy frightened me in terms of going back to the Cold War era. She is, unlike Mr. Obama, an interventionist, who would have inflamed international tensions, leaving Germany (and Europe) in an acid test between the West and East, facing armament.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian Weidner, Germany</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it brings hard time and aggression from Washington as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is unpredictable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khawar Mehmood, Pakistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be good for Europe, once President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is clear about his policy in fighting ISIS alongside Russia, holding a strong position in the region just like Russia, by doing the right thing, killing terrorists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maria da Gra&ccedil;a, Portugal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic Impact</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His plan to send back migrants will have a very deep impact in the social and economic conditions of my home country, place of origin of thousands of migrant workers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otton Solis, Costa Rica</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has already take down the value of our currency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jose Franco, Mexico</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Heads of state who succeed in generating wealth are rare. When that happens everyone is benefited, unfortunately the world lacks leaders with this ability, but there is no doubt that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is one of these men. It will surely bring great progress to the United States and to the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Monteiro, Brazil</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If America proceeds with protectionism and nixes Nafta, it might force Canada to seek out other trade partners. This would be painful in the short-term, but could potentially be beneficial in the future, where we are not so dependent on the U.S.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jia Lu, Chinese-Canadian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Locals are concerned that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will stir up trouble with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and destabilize the region. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is easily Australia's largest trading partner, and a lot of our economic prosperity rests on stable relations with them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James King, Australia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has called Nafta a disaster, the worst trade deal ever. Presumably, he will revoke it, or try to renegotiate its terms. Trade deals don't work as zero-sum equations. Nafta works because it has benefited all three of our North American economies. The Canadian market for consumer goods is relatively small and spread out along an east-west axis. If north-south trade is disrupted in both manufactured goods and agricultural products, the impact on the Canadian economy will be devastating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wally Seccombe, Canada</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our economy might benefit if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Republicans manage to get the Keystone XL pipeline built. However, I doubt this would offset the many negative effects his presidency could have on the Canadian economy generally and Alberta's nonoil industries, such as agriculture and forestry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Bott, Canada</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Access to the United States</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have two kids studying in the U.S. and an ex-spouse who holds H-1B visa. If he insists on deporting people with certain religious backgrounds and clamping down on the said visa, of course the future will be bleak for my family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zunaibi Abdullah, Malaysia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political Repercussions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the major impacts on my country is many people are going to highlight the flaws of democracy and we are going back to an era of strongman politics. This is the last thing I want to see and it is actually happening. And I don't think </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election means the failure of democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young, Beijing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe it is highly likely that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election will contribute [to] fueling the ambition of outsiders and would-be populist candidates in my country Chile, and the entire Latin American region for that matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Populism, mostly left-wing oriented populism, is already getting traction among Chileans, most notably among the youngest generations. The whole idea that with your vote you can now actually shake the status quo and bring about deep changes across the board is becoming stronger within the Chilean society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luis Alberto Pino, Chile</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Africa in general and Central Africa in particular, we are afraid that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy will be concentrated only on the United States. There will be no African policy at all. This situation will advantage dictators who are presently ruling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabriel Nyangwile, Democratic Republic of Congo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just would want to tell him one thing: It's been hundreds of years and we still don't even know what a ballot looks like. Can you make sure the American beacon of freedom continues to shine brightly enough for us to see it all the way from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Can you do your job so that one day </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is forced to let us elect our leader too, even if it means we have a leader like you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Li Dashan, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate Change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Me and my family's biggest immediate fear is a reversal of the climate-change agreement. That would make it so much easier for other countries around the world to also neglect the treaty. It scares us to think about the consequences for the next generations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Jan-Ulrich Sobisch, Germany</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xenophobia and Misogyny</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My son studies in the U.S. If xenophobia and racism become acceptable behavior, life will certainly become unpleasant for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Economically, a lot of employment is created by the I.T. industry, which relies heavily on the U.S. demand for services. This would be impacted negatively if he clamps down on outsourcing and free trade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bala Sathiapalan, India</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Being a young ambitious woman in Russia means being routinely subjected to misogynism, harassment and patronizing remarks both at work and in life. I was hoping that by electing the first woman president the United States would show the world and especially the girls who grow up in Russia that a woman should never, ever be simplified to an object of desire or hate, a kitchen gadget who gives birth to children and watches men make decisions for her concerning her health, her future, and her life. Now, with Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it would be as hard as ever to explain these things to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
