<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following is a transcript of Hillary Clinton's address to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on Thursday, as prepared for delivery by her campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you! Thank you for that amazing welcome. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Chelsea, thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you've become.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thanks for bringing Marc into our family, and Charlotte and Aidan into the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Bill, that conversation we started in the law library 45 years ago is still going strong.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's lasted through good times that filled us with joy, and hard times that tested us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And I've even gotten a few words in along the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Tuesday night, I was so happy to see that my Explainer-in-Chief is still on the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm also grateful to the rest of my family and the friends of a lifetime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And to those of you who joined our campaign this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And what a remarkable week it's been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We heard the man from Hope, Bill Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And the man of Hope, Barack Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  America is stronger because of President Obama's leadership, and I'm better because of his friendship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We heard from our terrific vice president, the one-and-only Joe Biden, who spoke from his big heart about our party's commitment to working people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  First lady Michelle Obama reminded us that our children are watching, and the president we elect is going to be their president, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And for those of you out there who are just getting to know Tim Kaine -- you're soon going to understand why the people of Virginia keep promoting him: from City Council and mayor, to Governor, and now Senator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He'll make the whole country proud as our Vice President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And ... I want to thank Bernie Sanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bernie, your campaign inspired millions of Americans, particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You've put economic and social justice issues front and center, where they belong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And to all of your supporters here and around the country:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I want you to know, I've heard you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Your cause is our cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Our country needs your ideas, energy, and passion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We wrote it together -- now let's go out there and make it happen together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  My friends, we've come to Philadelphia -- the birthplace of our nation -- because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We all know the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But we usually focus on how it turned out -- and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here, some wanted to stick with the King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some wanted to stick it to the king, and go their own way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The revolution hung in the balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then somehow they began listening to each other ... compromising ... finding common purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And by the time they left Philadelphia, they had begun to see themselves as one nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's what made it possible to stand up to a King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That took courage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They had courage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Our Founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  America is once again at a moment of reckoning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bonds of trust and respect are fraying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And just as with our founders, there are no guarantees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It truly is up to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We have to decide whether we all will work together so we all can rise together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Our country's motto is e pluribus unum: out of many, we are one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Will we stay true to that motto?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Well, we heard Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> answer last week at his convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He wants to divide us -- from the rest of the world, and from each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He's betting that the perils of today's world will blind us to its unlimited promise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He's taken the Republican Party a long way ... from ''Morning in America'' to ''Midnight in America.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He wants us to fear the future and fear each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Well, a great Democratic President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, came up with the perfect rebuke to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> more than eighty years ago, during a much more perilous time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now we are cleareyed about what our country is up against.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But we are not afraid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We will rise to the challenge, just as we always have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We will not build a wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good paying job can get one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And we'll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We will not ban a religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We will work with all Americans and our allies to fight terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There's a lot of work to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Too many people haven't had a pay raise since the crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There's too much inequality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Too little social mobility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Too much paralysis in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Too many threats at home and abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But just look at the strengths we bring to meet these challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We have the most tolerant and generous young people we've ever had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We have the most powerful military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The most innovative entrepreneurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The most enduring values. Freedom and equality, justice and opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We should be so proud that these words are associated with us. That when people hear them -- they hear ... America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So don't let anyone tell you that our country is weak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We're not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And most of all, don't believe anyone who says: ''I alone can fix it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those were actually Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> words in Cleveland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And they should set off alarm bells for all of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Really?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I alone can fix it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Isn't he forgetting?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Troops on the front lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Police officers and fire fighters who run toward danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Doctors and nurses who care for us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Teachers who change lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He's forgetting every last one of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Americans don't say: ''I alone can fix it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We say: ''We'll fix it together.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Remember: Our Founders fought a revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two hundred and forty years later, we still put our faith in each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Look at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And you know how the community responded?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's how Americans answer when the call for help goes out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  20 years ago I wrote a book called ''It Takes a Village.'' A lot of people looked at the title and asked, what the heck do you mean by that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is what I mean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  America needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I believe that with all my heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's why ''Stronger Together'' is not just a lesson from our history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's not just a slogan for our campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's a guiding principle for the country we've always been and the future we're going to build.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A country where the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school, no matter what ZIP code you live in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A country where all our children can dream, and those dreams are within reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Where families are strong ... communities are safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And yes, love </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">trumps</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's the country we're fighting for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's the future we're working toward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And so it is with humility ... determination ... and boundless confidence in America's promise ... that I accept your nomination for President of the United States!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As you know, I'm not one of those people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I've been your first lady. Served 8 years as a Senator from the great sate of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I ran for President and lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then I represented all of you as secretary of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But my job titles only tell you what I've done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They don't tell you why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The truth is, through all these years of public service, the ''service'' part has always come easier to me than the ''public'' part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So let me tell you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The family I'm from ... well, no one had their name on big buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  My family were builders of a different kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Builders in the way most American families are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They used whatever tools they had -- whatever God gave them -- and whatever life in America provided -- and built better lives and better futures for their kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  My grandfather worked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Because he believed that if he gave everything he had, his children would have a better life than he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And he was right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  My dad, Hugh, made it to college. He played football at Penn State and enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the war was over he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I remember watching him stand for hours over silk screens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And he did. My mother, Dorothy, was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She ended up on her own at 14, working as a house maid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She was saved by the kindness of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Her first grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, and brought extra food to share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The lesson she passed on to me years later stuck with me:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No one gets through life alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We have to look out for each other and lift each other up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She made sure I learned the words of our Methodist faith:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, going door-to-door in New Bedford, Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She told me how badly she wanted to go to school -- it just didn't seem possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And I couldn't stop thinking of my mother and what she went through as a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It became clear to me that simply caring is not enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You need both understanding and action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So we gathered facts. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's a big idea, isn't it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Every kid with a disability has the right to go to school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But how do you make an idea like that real? You do it step-by-step, year-by-year ... sometimes even door-by-door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And my heart just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza on this stage, representing millions of young people who -- because of those changes to our laws -- are able to get an education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's true ... I sweat the details of policy -- whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint, Michigan, the number of mental health facilities in Iowa, or the cost of your prescription drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Because it's not just a detail if it's your kid -- if it's your family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over the last three days, you've seen some of the people who've inspired me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  People who let me into their lives, and became a part of mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  People like Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They told their stories Tuesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I first met Ryan as a seven-year old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was wearing a full body brace that must have weighed forty pounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Children like Ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed ... and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lauren was gravely injured on 9/11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was the thought of her, and Debbie St. John, and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney, and all the victims and survivors, that kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of 9/11 families, and our first responders who got sick from their time at Ground Zero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I was still thinking of Lauren, Debbie and all the others ten years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama made the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In this campaign, I've met so many people who motivate me to keep fighting for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And, with your help, I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I will be a President for Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For the struggling, the striving and the successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For those who vote for me and those who don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For all Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tonight, we've reached a milestone in our nation's march toward a more perfect union: the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Standing here as my mother's daughter, and my daughter's mother, I'm so happy this day has come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Happy for boys and men, too -- because when any barrier falls in America, for anyone, it clears the way for everyone. When there are no ceilings, the sky's the limit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So let's keep going, until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Because even more important than the history we make tonight, is the history we will write together in the years ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Let's begin with what we're going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, I don't think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs. Twenty million more Americans with health insurance. And an auto industry that just had its best year ever. That's real progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But none of us can be satisfied with the status quo. Not by a long shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We're still facing deep-seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I've gone around our country talking to working families. And I've heard from so many of you who feel like the economy just isn't working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of you are frustrated -- even furious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And you know what? You're right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's not yet working the way it should.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Americans are willing to work -- and work hard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But right now, an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And less respect for them, period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Democrats are the party of working people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But we haven't done a good enough job showing that we get what you're going through, and that we're going to do something about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So I want to tell you tonight how we will empower Americans to live better lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  My primary mission as President will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From my first day in office to my last!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From our inner cities to our small towns, from Indian Country to Coal Country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And here's what I believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I believe that our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's why we need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights, not restrict them. And we'll pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I believe American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many of them are. But too many aren't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And I believe Wall Street can never, ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I believe in science. I believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be self-defeating and inhumane to kick them out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together -- and it's the right thing to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whatever party you belong to, or if you belong to no party at all, if you share these beliefs, this is your campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If you believe that companies should share profits with their workers, not pad executive bonuses, join us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage ... and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty ... join us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable health care ... join us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If you believe that we should say ''no'' to unfair trade deals ... that we should stand up to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ... that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers ... join us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If you believe we should expand Social Security and protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions ... join us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And yes, if you believe that your working mother, wife, sister, or daughter deserves equal pay ... join us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Let's make sure this economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, you didn't hear any of this from Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at his convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He spoke for 70-odd minutes -- and I do mean odd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And he offered zero solutions. But we already know he doesn't believe these things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No wonder he doesn't like talking about his plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You might have noticed, I love talking about mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In my first 100 days, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small business, and infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If we invest in infrastructure now, we'll not only create jobs today, but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And we will transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for all!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's just not right that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can ignore his debts, but students and families can't refinance theirs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And here's something we don't say often enough: College is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We're going to help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We're going to give small businesses a boost. Make it easier to get credit. Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We're going to help you balance family and work. And you know what, if fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the ''woman card,'' then Deal Me In!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (Oh, you've heard that one?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, here's the thing, we're not only going to make all these investments, we're going to pay for every single one of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And here's how: Wall Street, corporations, and the super rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not because we resent success. Because when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that's where the money is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas, we'll make them pay us back. And we'll put that money to work where it belongs ... creating jobs here at home!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now I know some of you are sitting at home thinking, well that all sounds pretty good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But how are you going to get it done? How are you going to break through the gridlock in Washington? Look at my record. I've worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people. And if you give me the chance, that's what I'll do as President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he's a businessman. He must know something about the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Well, let's take a closer look.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Atlantic City, 60 miles from here, you'll find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> refused to pay his bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  People who did the work and needed the money, and didn't get it -- not because he couldn't pay them, but because he wouldn't pay them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That sales pitch he's making to be your president? Put your faith in him -- and you'll win big? That's the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses. Then </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> walked away, and left working people holding the bag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also talks a big game about putting America First. Please explain to me what part of America First leads him to make </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ties in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not Colorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suits in Mexico, not Michigan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> picture frames in India, not Wisconsin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says he wants to make America great again -- well, he could start by actually making things in America again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The choice we face is just as stark when it comes to our national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From Baghdad and Kabul, to Nice and Paris and Brussels, to San Bernardino and Orlando, we're dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No wonder people are anxious and looking for reassurance. Looking for steady leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You want a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home. Keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do it will be my highest priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot -- now we have to enforce it, and keep supporting Israel's security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm proud that we shaped a global climate agreement -- now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments, including ourselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including from Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I've laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We will strike their sanctuaries from the air, and support local forces taking them out on the ground. We will surge our intelligence so that we detect and prevent attacks before they happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It won't be easy or quick, but make no mistake -- we will prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says, and this is a quote, ''I know more about ISIS than the generals do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No, Donald, you don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He thinks that he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are ''a disaster.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Well, I've had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years, including as a senator on the Armed Services Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I know how wrong he is. Our military is a national treasure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We entrust our commander-in-chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Decisions about war and peace. Life and death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country -- including the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, both Marines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ask yourself: Does Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can't even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he's challenged in a debate. When he sees a protester at a rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I can't put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started -- not by big men with self-control and restraint, but by little men -- the ones moved by fear and pride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  America's strength doesn't come from lashing out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Strength relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve, and the precise and strategic application of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's the kind of Commander-in-Chief I pledge to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And if we're serious about keeping our country safe, we also can't afford to have a President who's in the pocket of the gun lobby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm not here to repeal the Second Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I'm not here to take away your guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We should be working with responsible gun owners to pass common-sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and all others who would do us harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For decades, people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics were too hot to touch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But I ask you: How can we just stand by and do nothing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You heard, you saw, family members of people killed by gun violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You heard, you saw, family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I refuse to believe we can't find common ground here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We have to heal the divides in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not just on guns. But on race. Immigration. And more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That starts with listening to each other. Hearing each other. Trying, as best we can, to walk in each other's shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So let's put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism, and are made to feel like their lives are disposable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Let's put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day and heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We will reform our criminal justice system from end-to-end, and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We will defend all our rights -- civil rights, human rights and voting rights ... women's rights and workers' rights ... LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For the past year, many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments -- excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They think he couldn't possibly mean all the horrible things he says -- like when he called women ''pigs.'' Or said that an American judge couldn't be fair because of his Mexican heritage. Or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Or insults prisoners of war like John McCain -- a true hero and patriot who deserves our respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At first, I admit, I couldn't believe he meant it either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was just too hard to fathom -- that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things. Could be like that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But here's the sad truth: There is no other Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ... This is it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And in the end, it comes down to what Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't get: that America is great -- because America is good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So enough with the bigotry and bombast. Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not offering real change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He's offering empty promises. What are we offering? A bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country -- to keep you safe, to get you good jobs, and to give your kids the opportunities they deserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The choice is clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Every generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer, and stronger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  None of us can do it alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard to imagine how we'll ever pull together again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But I'm here to tell you tonight -- progress is possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I know because I've seen it in the lives of people across America who get knocked down and get right back up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And I know it from my own life. More than a few times, I've had to pick myself up and get back in the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like so much else, I got this from my mother. She never let me back down from any challenge. When I tried to hide from a neighborhood bully, she literally blocked the door. ''Go back out there,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And she was right. You have to stand up to bullies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You have to keep working to make things better, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We lost my mother a few years ago. I miss her every day. And I still hear her voice urging me to keep working, keep fighting for right, no matter what.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's what we need to do together as a nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though ''we may not live to see the glory,'' as the song from the musical Hamilton goes, ''let us gladly join the fight.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Let our legacy be about ''planting seeds in a garden you never get to see.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's why we're here ... not just in this hall, but on this Earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Founders showed us that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And so have many others since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They were drawn together by love of country, and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That is the story of America. And we begin a new chapter tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yes, the world is watching what we do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yes, America's destiny is ours to choose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So let's be stronger together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Looking to the future with courage and confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Building a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When we do, America will be greater than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thank you and may God bless the United States of America!</SPAN></P>
