<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weather and wars are responsible for many disasters these days. But two centuries ago, one was caused by an unusual culprit: beer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Oct. 17, 1814, the London Beer Flood took the lives of eight people in a densely populated slum known as St. Giles Rookery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A series of vats exploded at a brewery, breaking through a wall. Witnesses described a wave of porter ale and debris up to 15 feet high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An &quot;immense mass of ruins&quot; is how one newspaper described the scene. Among the victims were said to be a mother and daughter having tea. Others killed included mourners attending a wake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decades earlier, the poverty of St. Giles inspired &quot;Gin Lane&quot; by the artist William Hogarth. Perhaps because of the neighborhood's reputation, accounts of onlookers trying to scoop up the free booze became part of the tragedy's lore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A local pub pays tribute to the anniversary with special beers on tap. One that was once served was called the Beer Flood Porter.</SPAN></P>
