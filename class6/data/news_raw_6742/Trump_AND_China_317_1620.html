<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;It was already pretty great, despite its flaws, before he took office Friday.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presented such a graceless and disturbingly ahistoric vision of America on Friday that his Inaugural Address cast more doubt than hope on his presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of summoning the best in America's ideals, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> offered a fantastical version of America losing its promise, military dominance and middle-class wealth to &quot;the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With sweeping exaggeration, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke of &quot;carnage&quot; in the inner cities. He deplored all of this decline as a betrayal of America, implicitly trashing the four former presidents who sat listening behind him at the inaugural ceremony. Those presidents, Democratic and Republican, must have put Mexico first, or perhaps Sweden, or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Offering himself as a kind of savior, the leader of a &quot;historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before,&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proclaimed he would have a different priority: &quot;America First! America First!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though expectations couldn't have been terribly high, the opening moments of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency were beyond disappointing. He spoke to a nation in need of moving past the divisiveness that, not so incidentally, was his hallmark during the campaign. But what President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presented was more of candidate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, now more ominous in bearing the power of the White House, yet no less intent on inspiring only his base of aggrieved or anxious white Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new president offered a tortured rewrite of American history - ignoring the injustices of the past as well as the nation's economic resilience and social achievements in recent decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One longed, as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke, for a special kind of simultaneous translation, one that would convert Trumpian myth into concrete fact. It might have noted, when Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sounded like a politician from the 1980s in promising to &quot;get our people off welfare and back to work,&quot; that the number of people receiving federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits fell by more than 70 percent, to 1.2 million, between 1996 and 2016. As Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke about the disappearance of jobs, it would have noted that the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in 2009, the height of the recession, to less than 5 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> portrayed the nation's closed factories as having needlessly hemorrhaged jobs to overseas companies. But even as production jobs fell by about five million since 1987, the country's manufacturing output has increased by more than 86 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Trade is part of the complicated story, but so is automation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally misleading was his characterization that Washington has &quot;subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.&quot; The United States leads the world in military spending, allocating more than the next seven nations combined, including </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Russia. Current spending, in fact, is far higher than it was before the 9/11 attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> waxed apocalyptic in imagining the prevalence of crime in the nation's cities. &quot;This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,&quot; he vowed. Crime statistics fluctuate, but they show that crime remains far lower now than in past decades. And one big factor in violent crime - easily available firearms - is not likely to be remedied by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the candidate who was supported by the National Rifle Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was little music in his speech, and no gentleness in his jackhammer delivery, but Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did promise that &quot;a new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions.&quot; Yet he said nothing about such practical needs as effective enforcement of civil rights and police reforms by the Justice Department he will oversee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was hard to make sense of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> distorted vision of America's past and present. But the passion was familiar in his promise to &quot;make America great again,&quot; as if the nation were in despair and yearning to retreat somewhere with him. The crowd cheered him repeatedly, particularly when he vowed to &quot;unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate from the face of the earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vainglorious on a podium where other presidents have presented themselves as fellow citizens, preening where they have been humble, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declared that under him America will &quot;bring back our jobs&quot; and &quot;bring back our borders,&quot; &quot;bring back our wealth&quot; and &quot;bring back our dreams.&quot; This country has its challenges, and we fervently hope Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will address them. But America had dreams before Friday. It was great before Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> became president, and with his help - or, if necessary, in spite of his folly - Americans will find ways to make it greater in years to come.</SPAN></P>
