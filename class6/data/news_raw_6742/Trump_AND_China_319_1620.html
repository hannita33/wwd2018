<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- The Chinese state news media has already declared a winner in the scandal-stained race for the White House: one-party dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese Communist Party uses every presidential election to excoriate American democracy for its failings and argue that one-party rule works fine for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But this year has offered an embarrassment of riches for gloating, most recently a 2005 recording of Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bragging about sexual assault. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The American election again plumbs new depths in its bottom line,'' read the headline of an editorial from Xinhua, the main state news agency, on Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In the farce of American politics, these blowups have been coming faster than you can turn the pages of a book,'' the editorial said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The absence of any bottom line in party competition has already evolved into an absence of a moral bottom line,'' it said. ''The voters never see the lowest point, because things just keep getting even lower.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not everyone in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> buys that official viewpoint. For quite a few Chinese, especially middle-class people in their 20s and 30s with more exposure to the world, the spectacle of parties competing for support, and of the news media taking on the candidates, is uplifting, despite all the dirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Those kinds of things shouldn't be allowed to be said,'' Zhou Xinyu, a website editor, said of the recording of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''But I still think the American political system is actually great,'' Mr. Zhou, 22, said in an interview. ''If you look at Chinese politics, you can find many of the same type of people. What type is that? Rich people who feel like they can get away with anything.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, the scandals -- including Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server and excerpts from leaked speeches that she gave to banking and finance audiences -- could reinforce skepticism that democracy has anything better to offer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Chinese political system has its problems, but American politics is also really dark,'' said Wu Man, 32, a filmmaker. ''I'm a pessimist, and I am particularly cynical when it comes to politics,'' Ms. Wu said. ''There's no real democracy. Or, we can say that democracy is also a system dominated by interests. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is representative of that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's a theme the Communist Party has taken up with gusto. Even before Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> latest crisis, Chinese newspapers and journals were depicting him and Mrs. Clinton as puppets of wealthy elites, competing to do their masters' bidding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''For a long time, the United States trumpeted the extraordinary excitement of its elections as a symbol of its superior institutions,'' an editorial in People's Daily, the main Communist Party newspaper, said on Sunday. ''It's time for this 'teacher of democracy' to put away its super self-confidence and arrogance.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chinese politics is far more secretive than the noisy contention of Western democracy. Still, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> regularly produces its own eye-popping scandals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Sunday, the former Communist Party chief of Yunnan Province in southwest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was given a suspended death sentence after a court found him guilty of taking almost $37 million in bribes and possessing ''huge amounts'' of other unexplained wealth. But the state news media treats such cases as vindicating the party, showing that leaders are serious about wiping out corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chinese television has not shown the American presidential debates live, but interested people -- and there are many -- can follow closely on internet broadcasts and through quick Chinese translations of the debates. Chinese shared photographs of the latest debate online, doctored to look as if Mrs. Clinton and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were in a karaoke standoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may buck the assumption that Chinese people prefer Republican candidates, because they are seen as more pragmatic. A survey of 3,154 Chinese citizens in April and May overseen by the Pew Research Center found that 37 percent viewed Mrs. Clinton favorably and 35 percent saw her unfavorably, while 22 percent saw Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> favorably and 40 percent unfavorably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Democracy gives everyone free speech, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a public figure,'' said Ms. Wu, the filmmaker. ''I personally certainly do not like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but I feel that the American people generally are also nationalist and very frightening.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is staying out of the fight. Asked at a briefing on Monday about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> crude boasts, a spokesman, Geng Shuang, said: ''We do not comment on remarks made by relevant candidates in the U.S. presidential election.''</SPAN></P>
