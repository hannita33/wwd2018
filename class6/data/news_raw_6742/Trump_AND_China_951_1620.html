</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stock market has continued to reach new highs, troubled only fleetingly by rising interest rates, sluggish corporate earnings and new and uncomfortable political realities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monetary policy is tightening, government spending is expected to expand substantially, and, as the American presidential election and the vote in Britain to leave the European Union show, trade relations and other ties among nations may be fraying. How those trends progress should go a long way to determining the performance of stocks and bonds as the year moves along. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These aren't the only issues for investors to contend with, either. Economic indicators have perked up -- unemployment in December, reported on Jan. 6, was 4.7 percent, and consumer confidence is near multiyear highs -- but the earnings outlook remains subdued, stock valuations remain high and bond yields are low but rising. Under these circumstances, many investment advisers recommend taking only minimal, reasonably priced risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm hard pressed to locate any investment where you can make a strong argument that it's undervalued,'' said Joe Davis, global chief economist at Vanguard and head of the firm's Investment Strategy Group. ''Just as the economic environment seems to be improving, the investment environment is more challenging. Investors have more risk in their portfolios than at any time since 1999.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ben Inker, co-head of asset allocation at the GMO investment firm, likewise finds ''plenty of things to worry about.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index early this month traded at about 26 times the earnings that the constituent companies reported in the previous year, higher than at almost any time in history. One reason that investors are willing to pay so much is that they see even less value in other assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The rest of the world looks scarier than the U.S.,'' Mr. Inker said. ''Who would want to touch Europe? Who would want to touch emerging'' markets? As scary as they may appear, he recommends investing in emerging stock markets as the best of a series of difficult choices. ''It's not that we have high hopes for the emerging world this year,'' he said, ''but they're priced for a really bad outcome. The U.S. is priced for a really good outcome.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American stocks had a really good outcome in 2016. The S.&amp;P. 500 rose 9.5 percent, to 2,238.83, including a 3.3 percent gain in the fourth quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The average domestic stock fund in Morningstar's database rose 3.3 percent in the quarter and 10.9 percent on the year. Leading the way in the quarter, with double-digit gains, were portfolios that focused on financial services, smaller companies, energy and industrials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whether managers make the most of it, David Kelly, chief global strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management, finds solid prospects in American stocks this year, more than many of his peers do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He favors sectors most sensitive to rising growth, such as financial services, technology and consumer discretionary stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The general trend of government policy will be pretty pro-business and much more friendly to the U.S. corporate sector than it has been,'' he said. But he said that ''the Republicans may get sidetracked by antitrade rhetoric.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has proposed raising tariffs on imported goods, and some Republicans in Congress have proposed changing corporate tax rules to reward exporters and punish importers. Economists generally agree that higher tariffs reduce competitiveness and drive up prices of imported goods, including parts supplied to American manufacturers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly is also wary of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pledges to increase government spending on infrastructure projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There isn't actually any money in the budget to fulfill his agenda,'' he said. ''Congress may decide not to worry about it and push up the debt, and we'll end up with more debt and inflation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And we may have higher interest rates, too. The Federal Reserve raised rates in December, only the second time in a decade. Mr. Kelly expects three, possibly four, increases this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The more forbidding rate environment may account for much of the run-up in bond yields last year. Yields on 10-year Treasury issues rose to 2.44 percent at the end of December from 1.36 percent in early July, with most of the increase occurring just after Election Day, according to Bloomberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bond funds lost 1 percent in the fourth quarter, depressed by the 11.8 percent plunge in portfolios that specialize in long-term government issues. For the full year, according to Morningstar, the average bond fund was up 5.9 percent, helped by double-digit gains in riskier categories like high-yield and emerging market debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Laird Landmann, co-director of fixed income at the TCW fund-management company, said he saw little to recommend to investors because ''asset prices are getting out of whack with the economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Inflation is likely to keep rising, he predicted, perhaps exceeding 2.5 percent this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His advice is to play it safe and stick with Treasury bonds, certain mortgage-backed securities not issued or guaranteed by the federal government, and bonds issued by American banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's hard to buy things after eight years of a credit cycle,'' Mr. Landmann said. ''Wait for it to turn; that's the discipline of being a value investor.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When considering any benefits of spending measures introduced by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Congress, it's important to remember that they wouldn't be spread far and wide. Hope that the global recovery might at last get some legs helped emerging stock markets last year, but they gave back about seven months' worth of gains in the week after the election, as investors weighed the prospect of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protectionist campaign language being translated into action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The average emerging market stock fund lost 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter but still gained 9 percent for the year. International stock funds over all fell 2.8 percent in the quarter and rose 4.9 percent on the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of the worst-performing stock markets were in countries on which Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has focused. Mexico lost 8 percent in 2016, and the Shanghai Composite index in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was down more than 12 percent, although funds concentrating on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and its surroundings rose 0.7 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president-elect's outlook ''is clearly antiglobalization,'' said Rick Schmidt, co-manager of the Harding Loevner Emerging Markets Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Trade is going to have a bigger impact on some markets than others,'' he said. ''In emerging markets, clearly there are places where risk hasn't retreated. Mexico is No. 1, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is No. 2.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Whether he can implement'' his agenda ''is one thing, but you have to assume he means it,'' Mr. Schmidt added. ''It would be dangerous not to take him at his word.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Just as Mr. Inker prefers emerging markets because the risk they entail comes at the right price, Mr. Schmidt sees some of the best opportunities this year in beaten-down markets like Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Elsewhere, he finds India overpriced, and he is avoiding utilities and Chinese banks, although he likes banks in other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kelly also sees emerging markets as cheap and therefore good long-term plays, and he likes European stocks over the long haul, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While emerging markets are appealing to many based on their valuations, Mr. Landmann warned that they may be particularly vulnerable to potential missteps in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Markets are not going to crash necessarily, but you could see crashes in more fragile areas like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Davis, at Vanguard, advised investors to make sure they are globally diversified and not overly dependent on American markets. He also encouraged them to expect less. ''One risk for equity markets for 2017 is they are pricing in 4 percent economic growth,'' he said. ''I think that's unlikely; they seem to be discounting risks to free trade.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The economy has been growing at barely half that rate. ''I'm not bearish on the economy,'' Mr. Davis said, ''but I think expectations on returns need to be lowered.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Inker also suggested that investors keep their enthusiasm in check.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I would have thought that the prospect of surprising statements coming out of the White House in the form of tweets would generate uncertainty, and markets don't like uncertainty,'' he said. ''So far the U.S. market has not seemed to mind. We'll have to see. This is uncharted territory.''</SPAN></P>
