<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Austria, voters defied the right-wing populist wave by selecting Alexander Van der Bellen, 72, a former Green Party leader, as their next president.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Oakland, Calif., the death toll rose to 33 after a blaze tore through a warehouse hosting a musical event, one of the deadliest structure fires in the United States in years. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain's Supreme Court will begin hearing the government's challenge to a court ruling that requires it to seek parliamentary approval to start the process of leaving the European Union. [Reuters]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prosecutors begin closing arguments in the genocide trial of the former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic. [Reuters]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mainstream publishers, other than those deemed pro-Kurdish, have so far been untouched by the crackdown in Turkey, unlike journalists, teachers and lawyers. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two of Africa's longest rules are ending. Yahya Jammeh, who led Gambia for 22 years, was ousted in an election, and Jos&eacute; Eduardo dos Santos, who ruled Angola for almost four decades, said he would soon step down. [Quartz]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Syrian government troops now control about half of what had been for years a rebels' enclave in Aleppo. The United Nations Security Council votes today on a draft resolution that would demand a seven-day truce. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York's Metropolitan Opera is performing an opera written by a woman for the first time in more than 100 years. Here, we offer a playlist of other female composers, who are often overlooked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lapo Elkann, the globe-trotting Fiat heir, was enjoying a comeback when he was arrested after a sordid story of drugs, an escort and faking his own kidnapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soccer update: Real Madrid tied Barcelona thanks to a late goal. Roma pounced on two Lazio mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Upper Engadin, a section of the Swiss Alps, art galleries have emerged as an apr&egrave;s-ski alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And here's a taste of culinary archaeology: the torta tenerina, found on menus in Ferrara, Italy, is a simple cake with an almost creamy interior, and it could well be the ancestor of all &quot;flourless&quot; chocolate cakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision by the American air-conditioner maker Carrier to keep some jobs from being relocated to Mexico comes as its industry faces scrutiny over pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent global accord will curb hydrofluorocarbons, a chemical common in most air-conditioners that contributes to global warming. So the race is on to find greener alternatives as demand for air-conditioning rises around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Santa Clara University in California, heating and cooling systems are fueled by rooftop solar panels. And hydrofluoroolefins, an HFC substitute that is more energy efficient, are becoming popular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These technologies probably weren't on the mind of the American engineer Willis Carrier, above, who paved the way for modern air-conditioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1902, with cold water and an ammonia compressor, he figured out a way to control air temperature and the moisture in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of air-conditioning's next steps might be a return to the more distant past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In parts of the Middle East, the medieval wind tower is making a comeback. A physics professor has designed a smaller version of the structure, which pulls fresh air into buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've taken a traditional technology,&quot; the professor explains, &quot;and dragged it into the 21st century.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giovanni Russonello contributed reporting.</SPAN></P>
