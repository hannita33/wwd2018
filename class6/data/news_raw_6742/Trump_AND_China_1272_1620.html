</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good morning.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We're trying something new for our readers in Europe: a morning briefing to jump-start your day.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What do you like? What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at europebriefing@nytimes.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here's what you need to know: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is grappling with a new employment problem: how to find work for enough of the hundreds of thousands of migrants who've been streaming to the Continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although hundreds of German companies pledged to employ refugees, only a small fraction have done so in the past two years, a survey suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A French court rejected a request to delay closing the migrant camp in Calais known as the Jungle. The authorities are gradually relocating or deporting the 6,000 to 10,000 migrants at the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the northern city of Mosul from the Islamic State could take years, even with thehelp of roughly half of the 5,000 U.S. troops now in the country. Our reporting team sent this account from the front lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Syria, Russian and Syrian warplanes halted their bombardment of rebel-held districts in Aleppo ahead of an eight-hour &quot;humanitarian pause&quot; Russia had promised for tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those were President Obama's words for Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as he called on the Republican candidate to stop trying to &quot;discredit the elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's unprecedented,&quot; Mr. Obama said of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accusations that the coming American presidential election is rigged. &quot;It happens to be based on no facts.&quot; Mr. Obama spoke at a news conference with Italy's prime minister, Matteo Renzi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Hillary Clinton, who has been off the campaign trail for days, face off in their third and final debate today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said it had &quot;temporarily restricted&quot; the internet access of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at its embassy in London, after the whistle-blowing site published documents from Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government disputed the assertion by WikiLeaks that the decision was made because of U.S. pressure. President Rafael Correa recently said that he'd prefer Mrs. Clinton over Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Germany will host the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and France in Berlin today for talks aimed at reviving the peace process in eastern Ukraine but has dampened hopes that a deal could be reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One mustn't expect any wonders,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 's government moved to seize the house where Hitler was born, and it may tear it down, in an effort to demystify the site, which has become a magnet for neo-Nazis as well as tourists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said its economy grew 6.7 percent in the third quarter. While growth meets government targets, it comes in at a pace slower than last year's, which was already the weakest pace in 25 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could attempt to rescue the troubled E.U.-Canada trade pact later this week after trade ministers failed to approve the accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yoox Net-a-Porter announced a new technology hub in London, despite fears about the effect of Britain's vote to leave the E.U.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the Middle East, leaders are clinging to energy subsidies that negatively affect the environment, despite an economic rebound and cheap oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gained against the dollar overnight. Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around the Web</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Mars: Inside the High-Risk, High-Stakes Race to the Red Planet.&quot; Hazards include bone loss and brain damage, and that's before you get there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ExoMars 2016 spacecraft is to arrive at the red planet today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> : &quot;Oslo Is Creating The Model for How Cities Can Solve Climate Change.&quot; Taxis in the Norwegian capital will stop using gas by 2020; public transit will also forgo fossil fuels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;Which Countries Are Most Generous to New Parents?&quot; In Estonia and Hungary, new mothers can stay at home for three years. Switzerland and Ireland are at the stingy end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are flocking to Norway's Lofoten Islands, where the waves are cold and the air is colder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advances in the design of wet suits have opened some of the most frigid reaches of the world to surfers seeking unexplored waves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has set off a resurgence in home baking, but also put forward a contemporary vision of Britishness that emphasizes diversity and inclusiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">executed a member of the royal family for murder for the first time since 1975. The rare event rocketed around the kingdom's social media networks, with some saying they never imagined such a thing would happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have flipped the switch on a $66 million machine designed to help determine the mass of the universe's lightest particle, the neutrino.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. stock market has hit near-record heights this year, despite looming reasons for anxiety: the U.S. presidential election, &quot;Brexit,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic slowdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some analysts warn that a &quot;severe fall&quot; could be coming. They see a worrisome parallel in the current highs to the run-up to Black Monday, the global crash that sent stocks plummeting on this date in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 500 points in New York, a 22.6 percent decline that remains the largest in the index's history - even outstripping the 1929 plunge that heralded the Great Depression. Investors in U.S. stocks lost an estimated $1 trillion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Computerized trading systems were new, enabling a sell-off at a scale not seen before. More than 600 million shares were traded in New York, above. The American Stock Exchange's disk drives ran out of storage space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High-speed trading and communications amplified the crash around the world. Japan took record losses. Hong Kong stopped trading for the rest of the week. Europe's markets were in free fall. &quot;We've never had anything like this,&quot; a European trader said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a crisis on the scale of the Great Depression did not materialize. The drop, in the end, was far more modest than that of 2008. And the markets fully recovered within two years.</SPAN></P>
