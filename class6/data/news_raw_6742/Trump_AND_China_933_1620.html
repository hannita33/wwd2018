<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A report signed by scholars and former officials asked the president-elect to use the deal, which he has called a disaster, to further ease tensions with Iran.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventy-six national security experts urged President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Monday to reverse his hostility to the nuclear agreement signed with Iran last year and to use it as a tool to ease other tensions with the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report signed by the experts, including former officials from both major political parties, argued that the nuclear agreement had reduced the threat of war in the Middle East.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has called the nuclear agreement a foreign-policy disaster. He vowed during his campaign to renegotiate or renounce the deal, one of President Obama's signature achievements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report stated, &quot;The deal proved that diplomacy with Iran can bear fruit despite skepticism about Iranian sincerity, the inclination of Iran's supreme leader to abide by the deal, or the ability of Iranian hard-liners to sabotage diplomacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It urged the incoming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration to use the nuclear agreement as the basis for cooperation on other issues, including a desire by Iran and the United States to eliminate the Islamic State, which has convulsed the Middle East and carried out attacks in the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report was produced by the National Iranian American Council, a Washington group that has advocated improved relations with Iran, even while sharply criticizing Iranian leaders over human rights issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may have been critical of the Iran deal during the campaign, but he will need the deal to remain intact to achieve his other stated goals,&quot; Trita Parsi, the president of the council, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew J. Bacevich, a professor of international relations and history at Boston University who endorsed the report, said the question over whether Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;seeks to sustain and broaden the opening to Iran, or distances himself from this opportunity, promises to reveal much about his approach to statecraft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other prominent experts who endorsed the report included Lawrence J. Korb, a former assistant defense secretary under President Ronald Reagan; Lawrence Wilkerson, who served as chief of staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell; Chas W. Freeman Jr., a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia and assistant defense secretary for international affairs; and Gary Sick, a Columbia University scholar who served on the National Security Council under Reagan as well as Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nuclear deal relaxed many economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for reductions in its nuclear efforts and verifiable pledges to keep that work peaceful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of the agreement said Iran was an untrustworthy partner and had been granted too many concessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How easily - or even whether - Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can make good on his promise to renegotiate or scrap the agreement remains unclear. It was negotiated among Iran and six major powers including the United States, and was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The countries who joined the United States in signing the deal - Iran, Russia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain, France and Germany - have said they intend to honor the agreement, which would isolate the United States should it withdraw, and would weaken the effect of any unilateral American sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, European Union ministers added their endorsement of the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement, which officially took effect in January, has released hundreds of millions of dollars in impounded Iranian funds and spurred a rush of European business interest in Iran trade and investment deals, generating momentum that would be difficult to reverse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should the pact collapse, Iran would presumably be free to develop nuclear weapons, an outcome that many nations, including Iran's Middle East neighbors, say would destabilize the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repudiation of the agreement would also put him at odds with Russia, risking new tensions after vowing to improve Washington's relationship with Moscow.</SPAN></P>
