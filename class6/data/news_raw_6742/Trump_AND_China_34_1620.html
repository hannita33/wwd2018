</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his second book, John Pomfret, a journalist with extensive experience in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, has taken a microscope to an enormous subject: the relationship between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, from 1776 to the present. With growing stress points in that relationship and the emergence of strongman leaders in both nations, the book, &quot;The Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom,&quot; arrives during a precarious inflection point. It is peppered with characters that Mr. Pomfret uses to trace a long historical arc, from Howqua, a Cantonese tycoon, to Herbert Yardley, a prominent American cryptographer, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former United States Treasury secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Pomfret is scheduled to speak about his book on Tuesday at the Politics and Prose bookstore in Washington. In an interview, he discussed the history of interactions between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, President Xi Jinping's worldview and what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy might emerge from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has been the overarching paradigm of United States-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relations from the 18th century to now? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans and Chinese have been enchanting each other and disappointing each other since they first met in 1784, when the first U.S. ship landed in Guangzhou with a cargo of American-grown ginseng and silver to trade for tea. If there's a pattern to the relationship, it has been rapturous enchantment followed by despair. Right now, Americans are in the disenchantment phase of the cycle, as are the Chinese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You tell many colorful anecdotes of Americans and Chinese in contact with each other. Which one do you think best reflects the wider story?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the main goals of the book was to bring to light stories of unchronicled influence on both sides. The first American minister to the Qing court in Beijing was a young Republican named Anson Burlingame. Burlingame was a radical abolitionist who was dispatched to Beijing by the Lincoln administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burlingame believed that the West needed to give </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> time to develop and modernize and stop pressuring </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to change. He believed that the West had no right to criticize, for example, the way </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> treated Chinese Christians, and he argued that Western officials should tolerate the Chinese habit of maintaining that their emperor actually ruled the entire world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To me, Burlingame encapsulates one side of the American view of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, one that reappeared in the 1970s and lasted up through the beginning of the Obama administration - the idea, or rather the bet - that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would liberalize and become more like us as long as we facilitated its rise. In opposition to Burlingame, other Americans believed his views on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were, as one of his successors in Beijing put it, a &quot;hallucination.&quot; That also has formed a key part of the American perspective on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your book discusses the way governments in the two nations have interacted with each other, but you also go into detail on the roles that notable nonpolitical figures have played. To what extent does the United States-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relationship depend on the attitudes of each countries' leaders versus those of other citizens, whether they are from the elite classes or the grass roots?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, we and the Chinese, and our governments, elites and those from the grass roots, are captives of our past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the beginning of the relationship, individual Americans and Chinese created the relationship and imbued it with much of its meaning. American merchants and missionaries saw </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a vast market for stuff and for souls. Chinese saw America as a place that could save </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the depredations of other imperialist nations and, with its world-class educational system, as a model for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to emulate. At the same time, other groups of Americans feared the Chinese and, starting in the late 1870s, oppressed Chinese workers in America, starting a long history of fearing the industriousness of the Chinese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese had their own prejudices against Americans and American ideas as well, viewing them as immoral, sexually deviant and dangerous. Many of these dreams and nightmares, fantasies and biases we have about each other have resurfaced in subsequent decades. In Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s claim that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been &quot;raping&quot; the United States when it comes to trade, one can hear the populists of the California Workingmen's Party in late 19th-century California railing on the streets of San Francisco against &quot;the heathen Chinese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In your many years as a journalist in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, what were the most notable changes you saw in the United States-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relationship?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rise, Beijing is less willing to bend to Washington's will than before and more willing to aggressively pursue its interests, whether they involve trade or the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. Washington spent decades arguing that as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strengthened it would become more like a liberal Western nation. It hasn't turned out that way, and as such the U.S. has stopped doing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> any favors. Much more than before, it is blocking the sales of Western companies to Chinese firms and strengthening its alliances with nations around </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> periphery. The careful balance of containment and engagement that defined America's policy toward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is now heavily skewed toward containment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are your thoughts on President Xi Jinping's worldview and how the United States fits into that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xi Jinping has said he wants Asians to rule Asia, which I think can be translated into a desire to see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rule Asia. In this view, the U.S. is an interloper and would do best to retreat to Hawaii and let </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> handle the western Pacific. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> benefited greatly from the Pax Americana in the Pacific, but now Xi feels that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not need the U.S. to protect it anymore. It wants the U.S. out of Asia. Not next year, not the year after, but one day soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the election of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the next United States president, where do you see the relationship going?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not an outlier when it comes to his views on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. They are contradictory, but so were Obama's and those of many of his predecessors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the campaign, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seesawed between accusing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of &quot;raping&quot; the United States on trade, threatening to walk away from America's alliances in East Asia - and thereby ceding the western Pacific to Beijing - and mulling the idea of some type of &quot;grand bargain&quot; with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> where the U.S. would accept </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rise if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not endanger the status quo in Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will enter office against a backdrop of an Asia facing a nuclear-armed dictator in North Korea and a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> eager to capitalize on American missteps. How he juggles America's - and his own - competing mix of enchantment, disappointment and self-interested realism about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will help determine the future of the relationship and the future of the globe. If I had to guess, I think he is going to be more pragmatic than many initially thought, but prognostication is a tough business, especially when it comes to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
