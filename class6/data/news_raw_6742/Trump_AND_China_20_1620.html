<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- For </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> scrapping of the American-brokered Pacific trade agreement is a chance to extend Beijing's economic and political influence. And it is an opportunity to deepen ties with its neighbors in Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with a cooling economy at home and a looming leadership shake-up, the last thing President Xi Jinping wants is a trade war, though officials are girding for that possibility. Rather, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders crave stability and predictability. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Early signs indicate they may not get their wish. The Chinese fear that if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was willing to toss aside years of delicate negotiations with allies and decades of American trade policy, he could also go his own way on issues he has staked out with Beijing, including Taiwan and the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As if to bolster that point, on Monday -- the same day that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade agreement -- his spokesman said the United States would prevent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from accessing islands it claims in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, a threat that one nationalist Chinese newspaper had already warned would mean war.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This shows that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might act on his words,'' Deng Yuwen, a public affairs commentator in Beijing, said in an interview. ''With previous presidents, their election promises weren't taken so seriously.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added, ''That means </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must take his other warnings more seriously, especially about the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea and Taiwan.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> goal in squelching the trade agreement was to protect American jobs and businesses. His trade officials have argued that the deal does not do enough to help the United States or to contain </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which was not invited to join the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in killing an agreement designed to limit </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vast economic reach in Asia and anchor America's presence in the world's fastest growing region, analysts said, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> created a void that President Xi was already practicing to fill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Only last week, Mr. Xi was trying on the mantle of global leadership at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, suggesting that with the United States in retreat, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was prepared to step up as a champion of free trade and protector of the global environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Xi has kept </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economy behind high walls, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remains the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, but inconsistencies have never ruffled the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is indeed a big win for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the struggle for global leadership,'' said Zhang Baohui, director of the center for Asia Pacific studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is surrendering this opportunity to prove the continuing relevance of American primacy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The death of the trade agreement is likely to accelerate Beijing's push for its alternative trade agreement, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-centered Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That agreement would exclude the United States and would reduce or eliminate tariffs on trade among </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Southeast Asian nations, Australia, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. It includes few of the features of T.P.P. that would have been most awkward for Beijing, such as protections for independent labor unions and the environment, and requirements that state-owned enterprises behave more like commercial enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The agreement has stalled on rifts between Southeast Asian nations and the others, but Thailand's minister of commerce, Apiradi Tantraporn, said Monday that the talks ''are expected to be expedited'' without the T.P.P.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the end of the T.P.P. will not be Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last word on trade with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His trade officials say they expect greater access to the Chinese market in exchange for the easy access Chinese goods have to the United States. And they appear prepared to risk a trade war, an expanding tit-for-tat contest of tariffs and other trade restrictions, to get it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade officials have threatened to impose high tariffs on Chinese goods, starting with heavily subsidized products such as steel and aluminum, imported into the United States. ''It's a little weird that we have very low tariffs and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has very high tariffs,'' Wilbur Ross, the nominee for commerce secretary, said at his Senate confirmation hearing last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last week, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposed allowing greater foreign investment in certain sectors, but there was little confidence the recommendations would be carried out in the foreseeable future, and American businesses said they felt less welcome in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> than before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advisers say that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has more to lose than the United States in a trade war, Chinese officials told visiting American businessmen last week that Beijing was prepared. They had developed lists of punitive options they would take against the United States if Washington took the initiative, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The signals are very clear: If this is going to be a trade war, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will reduce imports of American aircraft from Boeing and agricultural products,'' said Wu Xinbo, director of American studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. ''We can turn to Europe, Australia and Canada for those products. And we know that 20 to 30 of the states in the United States with big agricultural lobbies and Boeing plants will be putting pressure on Congress.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A long-serving American trade expert in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agreed, saying </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was prepared to go to the mat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade team would be wise to shelve 'The Art of the Deal' and focus on the 'Art of War,' if they really want to know what's ahead in U.S.-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade relations,'' said James Zimmerman, a managing partner of the Beijing office of the law firm Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton who has worked in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for 19 years. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> views </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a paper tiger that will likely back down on the complicated, thorny issues that are not negotiable. The Chinese also know that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won't risk a trade war lest the business community will be up in arms.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Others, though, detect anxiety, and read </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> outward confidence as bluster. Bilahari Kausikan, ambassador at large for Singapore, said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had ''a real insecurity about a trade war.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both sides are likely to lose, he said, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stands to lose more ''since the U.S. domestic political order is not at stake in the same way as the Chinese Communist Party rule may be at stake.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The next few months, as Mr. Xi focuses on choosing new members of the ruling Standing Committee for his second five-year term, will be a particularly tense political period, and economic instability is the last thing he needs. Similarly, he will try at all costs to appear strong to his domestic, nationalistic audience in the face of challenges from Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Taiwan and the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has suggested that the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy, under which the United States recognizes the government of Beijing and not Taiwan, is not sacrosanct, a major concern for Mr. Xi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In a year of political transition, Xi cannot afford to come across as weak,'' said Paul Haenle, the director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, who served as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> director for the National Security Council under President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama. ''Taiwan is the core of core issues for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- a bottom line. Many Chinese stress that it is nonnegotiable.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But for now, at least, the increased contention with Washington is likely to strengthen Mr. Xi's political hand at home by rallying public and elite support against a foreign threat, said Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in California who studies Chinese politics and Chinese-American relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Short term, it will almost certainly give the Chinese government a boost in its public support,'' Dr. Pei said in a telephone interview. ''It helps Xi, because whenever there is such pressure from outside, Chinese officials tend to rally around the top leader.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has also threatened </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on control of territory it claims in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. The comments by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> press secretary, Sean Spicer, on Monday echoed those made by his nominee for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, at his Senate confirmation hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not explained how he will keep </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> off islands where it has built airstrips and installed weapons, the comments by his appointees suggest the possibility of an American blockade. While Mr. Obama tried unsuccessfully to leverage American allies in the region to compel </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to back down, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seems willing to abandon them and face </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That go-it-alone attitude has raised alarms at the Pentagon and among American Navy experts, who said such a blockade would be tantamount to war. The idea has also alarmed America's allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Australia, Washington's staunchest ally in the Asia Pacific region, would not participate in such a venture, its defense officials said, adding that a blockade could not be successful and could serve to persuade disenchanted American friends in the Asia Pacific to pivot toward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> portending divisive action on many fronts, Mr. Xi was calm and prepared, his foreign minister, Wang Yi, suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Serene under the tumultuous clouds,'' Mr. Wang said, quoting a line from a poem by Mao Zedong, the founder of Communist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No one knows how long that will be the case.</SPAN></P>
