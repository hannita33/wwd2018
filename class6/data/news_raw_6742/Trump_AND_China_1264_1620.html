<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Haley, a 44-year-old Indian-American, is the first female governor of South Carolina. Both she and Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon who ran against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Republican primary, have clashed with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain's government defended its revised, lower expectations on the country's economic growth, but supporters of the decision to leave the E.U. criticized the outlook as too gloomy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the Exchequer, cast aside the language of austerity and shelved a pledge by his predecessor to balance the budget by 2020.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air pollution causes 467,000 premature deaths in Europe every year, the European Environment Agency estimated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An experimental Alzheimer's drug that had previously appeared to show promise in slowing the deterioration of thinking and memory has failed in a large clinical trial. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mahmoud Abou Zeid, a photojournalist imprisoned in Egypt, received an International Press Freedom Award. Here's a look at his work. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Champions League: FC Rostov, in its first victory in soccer's most glamorous club competition, defeated Bayern Munich. Atl&eacute;tico Madrid defeated P.S.V. Eindhoven, 2-0. A tie between Napoli and Dynamo Kyiv was followed by violent clashes in the streets of Naples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Anselm Kiefer in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; is running in Beijing, but Mr. Kiefer wants no part of it. The German artist said the organizers did not get his permission for the show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our latest 360 video looks at a San Francisco restaurant that hosts a holiday meal for its employees and serves Burmese delicacies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ancient turkey eggs found in a fortress in Mexico suggest that humans domesticated the birds at least 1,500 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 14th-century Prague, Beatrice of Bourbon and her baby, Duke Wenceslaus I, became the first mother and child to both survive a cesarean section, it is now believed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the eight-line poem by Anne Frank we told you about yesterday? It fetched about $148,000 at auction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a billion tons of food is wasted each year, according to the U.N., and the United States is the among the biggest offenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country wastes about 400 pounds of food per person, yet one in seven Americans goes hungry each day, one estimate finds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But amid the gloomy news, a recent report by Harvard University outlined several innovative efforts taking place worldwide to minimize waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pair of apps attack the problem in two ways. One in San Francisco locates places with unused food so that it can be driven to shelters and churches. Another serving the European Union alerts consumers to deals on items nearing their expiration dates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inhospitable climates can also contribute to food waste. A solar-powered refrigerator has been used to preserve food in a particularly hot region of India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes it's a matter of looks. Fruits and vegetables are often tossed because they're misshapen. A company in Germany picks up &quot;odd-looking&quot; edibles and cooks them for catered events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The kitchen is also a focal point of a three-pronged program in Washington. Unemployed residents are trained to be chefs. Using unwanted food, they make meals for the homeless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for how we can reduce food waste at home, an expert offers a simple tip: Buy less and freeze more.</SPAN></P>
