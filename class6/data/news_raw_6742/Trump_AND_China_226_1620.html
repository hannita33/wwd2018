<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has threatened to roll back President Obama's sweeping d&eacute;tente, but some analysts say the president-elect's instincts as a real estate mogul and hotel developer would ultimately prevail.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI - To Chad Olin, it seemed like the perfect opportunity: Decades of animosity between the United States and Cuba were peeling away, opening a final frontier in the Caribbean to dollar-wielding Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Olin, 30, a Harvard Business School graduate, gave up a career in private equity to break into the Cuba travel market. He started a company that organizes trips for millennials to legally visit Cuba - a business made possible because President Obama has broadened travel to the island and expanded licenses for Americans to do business there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what happens now, Mr. Olin wonders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the campaign trail, President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> threatened to roll back the sweeping d&eacute;tente with Cuba, lambasting the &quot;concessions&quot; made to its Communist government and raising the possibility that one of Mr. Obama's signature foreign policy initiatives could be stripped away.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am still trying to think about what this means for my business that I spent literally the last two years working on, setting up something that was going to be perfect for an open market,&quot; Mr. Olin said. &quot;If we go back to the old way, I don't know if I have a business. It's a huge blow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of thousands of people have taken advantage of Mr. Obama's decisions to loosen travel and other restrictions on Cuba. More Americans and Cuban &eacute;migr&eacute;s now travel to Cuba, and the number of Americans who visited the country rose by 50 percent last year, according to the state news media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More Cubans receive money transfers and parcels. There's a Four Points Sheraton in Havana, and three more hotels are set to open. Airbnb rents private rooms, and American Airlines is about to start direct flights to Havana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For them, and Mr. Olin, the critical question remains whether Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a real estate mogul and hotel developer, will be a businessman at heart and allow Mr. Obama's measures to continue - or if he will instead keep a vow he made and scale back everything from diplomatic relations to the unlimited rum and cigars Mr. Obama recently allowed from Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a move by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would underscore the shifting relations between the United States and Cuba, which have long depended on who occupied the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Several large European investment groups have asked me to take the '</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Magic' to Cuba,&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> once wrote in a 1999 editorial in The Miami Herald supporting the trade embargo against Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My investment in Cuba would directly subsidize the oppression of the Cuban people,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;But I'd rather lose those millions than lose my self-respect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has, at other times, been vague on the issue. During the primary contest, he repeatedly said he thought restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba was &quot;fine,&quot; but added that the United States and the Cuban people did not get enough in return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the election approached, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> grew less equivocal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, he told CNN that he would &quot;probably&quot; continue having diplomatic relations with Cuba, but he said he would want &quot;much better deals than we're making.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took a harder line in Miami this fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of the concessions Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done through executive order, which means the next president can reverse them, and that I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands,&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said at a campaign event in September. &quot;Not my demands. Our demands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice President-elect Mike Pence reaffirmed that stance on Twitter, saying Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would repeal Mr. Obama's executive orders unless there was &quot;real political and religious freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked by a reporter if his comments meant he would break off diplomatic relations with Cuba, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggested that he might, and said he probably would not appoint an ambassador to Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The agreement President Obama signed is a very weak agreement,&quot; he said. &quot;We get nothing. The people of Cuba get nothing, and I would do whatever is necessary to get a good agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert L. Muse, a lawyer who specializes in United States-Cuba trade law, said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seemed to believe that Washington had struck a single deal with Cuba, when in reality there are several agreements that range from direct mail to managing oil spills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could pick through them one by one to eliminate the ones he dislikes and keep others. But Mr. Muse said the American government could be financially liable if it pulled out the rug from under companies that had acted in good faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rescinding enhanced travel that Obama has introduced would be the most tragic thing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might do, but I don't think he will,&quot; Mr. Muse said. &quot;He has invested a lifetime in travel, resorts and hotel accommodations, and it's a global enterprise. It seems counterintuitive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What else could Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Change travel rules. Tourism to Cuba is still illegal under the embargo, but President Bill Clinton was the first to allow &quot;people-to-people&quot; excursions that allow travelers to go if the trip is, for example, for educational or religious purposes. President George W. Bush scrapped those, and then Mr. Obama expanded them so that travelers no longer needed to get special permission first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Mr. Bush, a Cuban-American could visit once every three years. Now, it's unlimited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">End regularly scheduled commercial flights to Cuba. Cuba and the United States agreed to allow up to 90 daily round-trip flights between the nations, the Department of Transportation said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southwest began its service on Sunday, and American Airlines is set to start flights to Havana on Nov. 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are full steam ahead and can't speculate as to any possible future changes,&quot; Martha Pantin, an American Airlines spokeswoman, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scrap the contentious &quot;wet foot, dry foot&quot; policy. When tens of thousands of Cubans took to the seas in 1994, Mr. Clinton changed American policy so that anyone caught at sea was sent back. But tens of thousands of Cubans continue to migrate to the United States anyway, most by land, because if they arrive they can stay. Many have walked across the Americas to reach the southern border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the big, main ways </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> looks at foreign policy is through the issue of immigration,&quot; said Phil Peters, a longtime Cuba expert who now serves as a consultant for American companies seeking to do business there. &quot;When it gets to Cuba, he's going to see a country where there's a lot of illegal immigration coming to the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Change the rules that allow businesses like Airbnb and Marriott to operate in Cuba. He can do this. But if he's a developer at heart, would he?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John S. Kavulich, the president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, said that in the 1990s the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> organization inquired with him about the logistics of doing business in Cuba. Newsweek reported that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts paid at least $68,000 to a consulting firm in late 1998 to go to Cuba on the company's behalf, in an apparent violation of the American trade embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maurcio Claver-Carone, the founder of a political action committee that supports the trade embargo, said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seemed genuinely moved by stories of human rights violations in Cuba, so he &quot;made a commitment&quot; to the Cuban-American community that he was likely to keep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is most likely to repeal the orders that were &quot;blatantly inconsistent with U.S. law,&quot; Mr. Claver-Caron said, such as allowing investments with companies run by the Cuban military. (The hotel industry in Cuba is run by the armed forces.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could also overturn a move from late October that broadened the pool of Cuban officials who are allowed to receive cash allowances and conduct banking transactions with Americans, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team did not respond to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in Cuba, several people interviewed said the changes Mr. Obama made had not yet made their way down to the people. Some felt that the expansion of business opportunities had helped the Castro government, not the people, so they were generally pleased with the idea of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roberto Pe&ntilde;alber, 34, said many Cubans had felt forced to flee under Mr. Obama, because they feared he would rescind preferable immigration treatment for Cubans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now we don't have to worry about that,&quot; he said. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could possibly make better deals than Hillary. She's more communist than he is. That's maybe why the United States voted for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;</SPAN></P>
