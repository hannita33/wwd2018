<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The president-elect has suggested that the &quot;One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; policy could be used as a bargaining chip, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has some leverage of its own.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has made it clear that he views the central basis for diplomatic relations between Washington and Beijing - known as the &quot;One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; policy - as ripe for review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under that decades-old policy, the United States severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan as part of its recognition of the People's Republic of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But in early December, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stunned officials across the globe by becoming the first president or president-elect to speakto a Taiwanese leader since at least 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then on Sunday, he suggested that adhering to the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy could be used as a bargaining chip on contentious issues like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> currency and its activity in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. &quot;I don't know why we have to be bound by a One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy unless we make a deal with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> having to do with other things, including trade,&quot; he said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In trying to use Taiwan that way, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hit the most sensitive of what the Chinese Communist Party calls its &quot;core interests.&quot; If Washington formally recognizes Taiwan, the Chinese are expected to break off diplomatic relations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the United States officially ended relations with Taiwan in 1979, it maintains an unofficial embassy there called the American Institute in Taiwan. It has also sold Taiwan advanced military equipment and has worked to promote its democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, rejected Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggestion that American support for Taiwan was negotiable. &quot;Taiwan is not a source of leverage,&quot; Mr. Earnest said Monday. &quot;It's a close partner of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Global Times, a Chinese state-run tabloid, put the matter more bluntly, saying Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was &quot;like a child in his ignorance of foreign policy.&quot; It added: &quot;The One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy cannot be bought and sold. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it seems, only understands business and believes that everything has a price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are five ways the Chinese could make life difficult for a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade and Investment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese analysts say </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has plenty of leverage to retaliate against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. One prominent target is Boeing, whose Seattle plant Xi Jinping, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, visited in September 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2016, Boeing is expected to complete plane deliveries to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> worth $11 billion, mostly 737s that have become the workhorse of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rapidly expanding airlines. The Global Times warned that it would be easy for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to switch orders to Boeing's European competitor, Airbus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On economic issues, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has more and more leverage,&quot; said Wu Xinbo, the director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University. &quot;If we feel he is still pushing the Taiwan issue, we will take action. If he wants to keep it up on Taiwan, it will only backfire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American trade officials worry that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could intensify its discrimination against American technology firms by using the country's antimonopoly laws. Last year, the Chinese government slapped a $975 million fine on Qualcomm, a San Diego-based chip maker, for what it said were licensing infractions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few years ago, there were worries that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might suddenly dump a large portion of its holdings of Treasuries, pushing up interest rates in the United States. Those fears ebbed as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pared its holdings gradually. Its holdings of Treasuries peaked at $1.65 trillion in March 2014, declining to about $1.3 trillion, said Brad Setser at the Council on Foreign Relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say that even if the country sold more, it may not have much effect because interest rates are already low, global demand for Treasuries has been strong, and the Federal Reserve could buy more bonds if needed to offset action by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could also weaken its currency, something Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has argued it already does to make its products cheaper. But that could also result in more Chinese taking their money out of the country, as well as inflation for a nation that increasingly buys what it needs from abroad, like oil, because a weak currency means </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must pay more for imported goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could order its state-owned companies and private enterprises to slow their investments in the United States. A recent study by the Rhodium Group, a New York-based economic policy outfit, showed that since 2015, the amount of Chinese direct investment in the United States has outweighed the amount of American investment in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Korea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said on Sunday, &quot;And frankly, they're not helping us at all with North Korea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has in fact cooperated with some American initiatives on curbing North Korea's nuclear program, specifically backing United Nations economic sanctions last month aimed at checking the North's foreign exchange earnings from coal, its biggest export earner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could switch from being a reluctant ally of North Korea to a friendly neighbor. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is already angry at Washington for the recent decision to deploy a defense shield in South Korea, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, known as THAAD, which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> argues is aimed at limiting its military capabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the tools </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could use would be improved trade, aid and investment to strengthen the North's rudimentary economy, said John Delury, an American analyst in Seoul, South Korea. As a longstanding ally, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could conduct joint military exercises with the North, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In return for promises by North Korea not to proliferate, Mr. Delury said, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could go beyond improved trade, and provide substantial economic backing in a Marshall Plan-style initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate Change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama spent much of his political capital with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ensuring that Beijing would agree to the international climate change agreement that committed the world's two biggest carbon emitters to lower greenhouse gases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of Mr. Obama say he failed to force </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to open up its markets, stood by while </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fortified islands in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea and remained largely silent while Mr. Xi carried out repressive human rights policies in order to save the climate change accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agreement to the international deal was less a concession to American pressure than a restatement of its own goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was relatively easy for Mr. Xi to agree to a reduction in emissions given the outcry among the Chinese public about air pollution and contaminated food. The accord calls for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> carbon emissions to reach a plateau or decline &quot;around 2030&quot; but without any specific target for reductions like those Mr. Obama pledged for the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Xi would be unlikely to touch the climate accord because of the popularity of the prospect of cleaner air among the Chinese public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if he did decide to ignore it, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would probably not care. At one point, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said climate change was a &quot;hoax&quot; invented by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to hurt American trade. Later, he said he was joking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taiwan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supports Taiwan, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first response may be to punish Taiwan rather than the United States, in an attempt to diminish its value to Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could begin by intensifying efforts to persuade the 22 small sovereignties around the world, including the Vatican, that still maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan to sever them and recognize </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might then take aim at Taiwan's economy by restricting Chinese investments and limiting the number of Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taiwan already has de facto independence, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has warned that it will go to war to prevent it a formal separation from the mainland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Beijing's perspective, the fear is that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> moves could encourage Taiwan to declare independence or that other nations might follow the United States in recognizing Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan declared independence, &quot;and the whole world says Taiwan is independent,&quot; then </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;will take military action,&quot; said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University. &quot;But I don't believe that is Tsai's intention,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iran</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was a signatory to the nuclear accord reached with Iran in 2015 that lifted sanctions in return for Iran's getting rid of 98 percent of its nuclear material. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> now has unfettered access to its longtime friend's economy. Through Iran, Beijing will seek to enhance its influence in the Middle East, with the goal of weakening American prestige in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if the deal is scrapped and renegotiated, as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has called for, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would keep trading with Iran, isolating the United States, said Edward C. Chow, senior fellow for energy and national security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About one-third of Iran's oil exports go to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is Iran's top importer of goods. Thus </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is Iran's top trading partner, a position that would not change in the event of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> renouncing Washington's participation in the nuclear deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anything, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would redouble trading and investment in Iran now that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has started on the Taiwan front,&quot; Mr. Chow said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from New York, and Gardiner Harris from Washington.</SPAN></P>
