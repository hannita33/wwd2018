<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain's exit from the European Union shocked global markets and unleashed uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The British pound plunged to its lowest level since 1985.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Investors fled risky assets and flooded into the United States dollar and the Japanese yen, as Bank of England earmarked 250 billion pounds for potential stability measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  LONDON -- No one really knows what happens now. The collective imagination leads to dark places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The world map has been redrawn with the rules of commerce across Europe, the largest marketplace on earth. Britain's vote on Thursday to leave the European Union has set in motion an unprecedented and unpredictable process that threatens turbulence and potential crisis -- for Britain, for Europe and for the global economy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of most immediate consequence, Britain's vote to leave Europe sent global markets on a wild descent. Investors gaped at this major refashioning of the global landscape and decided it looked perilous -- or at least so pockmarked with uncertainty that they preferred to pull their money out of riskier corners like stock markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Few expect that Britain's departure from Europe will set off a full financial crisis like the one seen after the collapse of the investment banking giant Lehman Brothers in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But no one knows enough to rule that out, either. The world has never been here before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The British pound plummeted by 10 percent, reaching levels not seen since 1985 -- well below the value at the worst of the 2008 financial crisis. The euro dropped nearly 4 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stock markets across Asia recoiled in fright, with the major Japanese index, the Nikkei, down nearly 8 percent. As markets opened in Europe on Friday morning, the rout accelerated. Stocks in London were instantly down nearly 16 percent, shares in Frankfurt lost 10 percent, and the exchange in Paris was off 8 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Less than an hour after the markets opened in London, punishing shares of banks in particular, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, stood in front of television cameras to announce that the central bank had earmarked 250 billion pounds (about $344 billion) to unleash as needed for stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As panic seized world markets, investors took refuge in the safest investments, boosting the value of British government bonds and the Japanese yen. That exacerbated troubles for the Japanese government, which has aimed for a weaker currency to spur exports and economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whatever happens, a long confusing period now unfolding seems certain to yank Europe back into acute anxiety just as it seemed to be finally recovering from a punishing economic downturn, one that had thrust Greece and Spain into veritable depressions while erasing years of wealth across the Continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Brexit vote raised the prospect of sustained anxiety in the global economy as investors struggle to surmise what is happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the world's second-largest economy behind that of the United States, is slowing significantly, and the markets have little faith in the data provided by its Communist Party government. Brazil, once a darling among emerging markets, is in full-blown crisis. Europe and its common market, home to 500 million people, have been plunged into turmoil, their prospects difficult to divine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Markets crave known facts and fret about variables, seeing potential risks in all unknowns. An enormous portion of the map is now draped in uncertainty, effectively impervious to calculation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The vote appears likely to prompt multinational banks to shift significant numbers of jobs from Britain to competing financial centers in the European Union, led by Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin and Amsterdam. Many experts assume Brussels will move quickly to restrict trading of euro-denominated assets -- a major business for Britain. Prominent banks including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup warned during the campaign that a Brexit would cause them to transfer some operations elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As investors pulled back in fear on Friday, entrusting their money only to the safest places like U.S. Treasuries, the moves appeared to foreshadow a tightening of credit for many. Emerging markets may find it difficult to secure investment, limiting economic growth. Borrowing costs are likely to rise in heavily indebted nations, including Greece, Italy and Portugal, as investors demand extra inducements to put their money in riskier locales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Bank of England may have to raise interest rates to halt a plunge in the pound, the opposite from the usual playbook when an economy suffers a shock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most broadly, the Brexit vote is likely to resonate as a sign that major democracies are increasingly vulnerable to the influence of populist political movements that curry favor by demonizing immigrants and external forces -- officials in Brussels and Washington, low-wage workers in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The noisy and acrimonious campaign for Brexit played on inchoate fears in Europe and much of the developed world: dismay over globalization at a time of intensified competition for jobs, and angst over immigration as it refashions conceptions of national identity. These sentiments will surely find additional avenues for expression, challenging trade arrangements, reinvigorating existential questions about the shared euro currency and sowing uncertainty throughout the financial realm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Economists and political analysts have been watching the Brexit campaign as a gauge of the potency of anti-immigrant sentiments far beyond Britain. The success of the Brexit movement is likely to resonate in financial markets as cause to assume a higher probability that Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be elected president of the United States, riding his pledges to bar Muslim immigrants and erect a wall along the Mexican border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Given Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> talk of renouncing trade agreements and renegotiating the terms of American debt, investors are likely to take rising odds of his election as impetus to limit their exposure to risk, eschewing stock markets and plowing funds into the safest forms of government debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Brexit vote was ''essentially against economic rationality and driven by identity concerns and unease about globalization and trade,'' said Nicolas V&eacute;ron a senior fellow at Bruegel, an independent research institution in Brussels. ''If such a vote can win in the U.K., that fosters among investors a sense of the likelihood that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can also win, and that will have an adverse effect on capital markets.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not least, the vote unleashes considerable forces of uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though the vote changes nothing for at least two years, it kicks off what are certain to be complex and politically fraught negotiations between Britain and the 27 remaining members of the European Union over their future dealings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Central to these talks is the future of Europe's common market, which allows goods and services to be traded freely throughout its vast territory. Given that Britain sells almost half of its exports in the common market, and given that many multinational companies have forged bases in Britain as a means of serving customers across the Continent, any impediment is likely to be expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Disruption to trade was a major assumption in many academic studies released during the campaign that almost universally forecast substantial and potentially lasting damage to the British economy should Britain opt to leave Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During the campaign, those supporting a Brexit emphasized that Britain would remain in the common market during the negotiating period. They assured voters that Britain would strike a more beneficial trade deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But prominent leaders -- not least, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany -- warned that a jilted European Union would be in no mood to extend Britain a rewarding deal, lest other malcontent members take encouragement to go for the exits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If no deal is struck, the rules of the World Trade Organization could apply. They give member nations the rights to impose potentially steep tariffs on imports, raising the possibility of a tit-for-tat trade skirmish between Britain and the Continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the meantime, the lack of clarity is likely to damage economic growth in Britain and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You get a rabbit-in-the-headlights phenomenon where businesses don't want to make new decisions, or new investments, because they are uncertain about the future,'' said John Van Reenen, director of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. ''The immediate effect will be a lowering of investment activity, a lowering of hiring. There will an immediate slowdown of growth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The success of the Brexit campaign deals a formidable blow to an already weakened European Union and heightens the likelihood that fresh separatist movements will emerge. Scotland will all but certainly seek to separate itself from Britain after a failed referendum two years ago. In the Netherlands, France, Hungary and Italy, the success of the Brexit campaign should increase the intensity of so-called euroskeptic parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''For Europe, it raises the market's perception of breakup risk,'' said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If another euro crisis emerges, Europe may lack the political cohesion to address it. Further separatism could fragment the common market, bringing the demise of the six-decade-old project of European integration. Few now expect that to occur. But whatever the risks were before, Britain just increased them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''At some point, you wonder how many blows a body can take,'' Mr. Van Reenen said. ''I don't think this will happen, but there's this risk that everything will fall apart.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.         </SPAN></P>
