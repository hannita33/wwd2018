</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Former Senator Bob Dole, acting as a foreign agent for the government of Taiwan, worked behind the scenes over the past six months to establish high-level contact between Taiwanese officials and President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s staff, an outreach effort that culminated last week in an unorthodox telephone call between Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Taiwan's president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dole, a lobbyist with the Washington law firm Alston &amp; Bird, coordinated with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign and the transition team to set up a series of meetings between Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advisers and officials in Taiwan, according to disclosure documents filed last week with the Justice Department. Mr. Dole also assisted in successful efforts by Taiwan to include language favorable to it in the Republican Party platform, according to the documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dole's firm received $140,000 from May to October for the work, the forms said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disclosures suggest that President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision to take a call from the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, was less a ham-handed diplomatic gaffe and more the result of a well-orchestrated plan by Taiwan to use the election of a new president to deepen its relationship with the United States - with an assist from a seasoned lobbyist well versed in the machinery of Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're very optimistic,&quot; Mr. Dole said of the Taiwanese in an interview on Tuesday. &quot;They see a new president, a Republican, and they'd like to develop a closer relationship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States' One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy is nearly four decades old, Mr. Dole said, referring to the policy established in 1979 that denies Taiwan official diplomatic recognition but maintains close contacts, promoting Taiwan's democracy and selling it advanced military equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phone call between Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Ms. Tsai was a striking break from nearly four decades of diplomatic practice and threatened to precipitate a major rift with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which admonished Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a front-page editorial in the overseas edition of People's Daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disclosure documents were submitted before the call took place and made no mention of it. But Mr. Dole, 93, a former Senate majority leader from Kansas, said he had worked with transition officials to facilitate the conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's fair to say that we had some influence,&quot; he said. &quot;When you represent a client and they make requests, you're supposed to respond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team did not respond to requests for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documents suggest that Mr. Dole helped the government of Taiwan establish early access to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inner circle during the campaign, when Mr. Dole worked to involve Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aides in a United States delegation to Taiwan and to facilitate a Taiwanese delegation to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort has continued in the weeks since the election, with Mr. Dole on Tuesday saying he was trying to fulfill a request from a special envoy from Taiwan who was visiting Washington to see Reince Priebus, tapped by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be White House chief of staff, and Newt Gingrich, who is close to the president-elect. (The Priebus meeting, Mr. Dole said, would most likely have to wait until Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is inaugurated.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dole, the only former Republican presidential nominee to endorse Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, arranged a meeting between Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, whom Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has chosen to be his attorney general, and Stanley Kao, Taiwan's envoy to the United States, and convened a meeting between Taiwanese officials and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team, the documents say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Dole, who said he first took an interest in Taiwan as a senator when Congress was considering the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act that established the current policy, has lobbied for the Taiwanese government for nearly two decades. In a letter in January, Mr. Dole laid out the terms of his agreement to represent the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States, Taiwan's unofficial embassy, including a $25,000 monthly retainer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That letter and the document detailing Mr. Dole's work for the Taiwanese were filed at the Justice Department, which requires foreign agents to register and detail their efforts at influencing the United States government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among his duties, the letter said, were helping Taiwan achieve its &quot;military goals&quot; and obtain membership in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade deal that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has promised to withdraw from. Mr. Dole was also to arrange for Taiwanese officials to meet with members of Congress from both parties and arrange access to Republican presidential contenders and to the party's national convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government of Taiwan has retained a powerful bipartisan constellation of former members of Congress to promote its interests in Washington. Richard A. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat and former House majority leader, also signed a $25,000-a-month contract to represent the Taipei office this year, as did Thomas A. Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, a former Senate majority leader, in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team has sent mixed messages about the call with Ms. Tsai, whether it was meant as a mere gesture of good will or a provocation aimed at drawing Taiwan closer to the United States as a way of challenging </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice President-elect Mike Pence suggested in the days after the call that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had merely been affording a courtesy to another &quot;democratically elected leader.&quot; But in a series of Twitter posts on Sunday, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggested a more confrontational motive, criticizing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for unfair trade practices and aggressive military moves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ask us if it was OK&quot; to take such actions, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asked rhetorically, appearing to counter suggestions that the United States must ask Beijing's permission to communicate with Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several senior advisers to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have long advocated stronger United States support for Taiwan, arguing that it would help to counterbalance Beijing's influence. Alexander Grey and Peter Navarro, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition advisers, wrote an article last month in Foreign Policy branding the Obama administration's treatment of Taiwan &quot;egregious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend, Taiwan's official Central News Agency said that Edward J. Feulner, a member of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team and the former president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that supports stronger ties with Taiwan, had played a crucial role in bringing about the call with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Mr. Feulner met with Ms. Tsai in Taiwan in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the phone call, Taiwan had succeeded in accomplishing important goals with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> team. At their convention in Cleveland in July, Republicans adopted a platform that for the first time enshrined the &quot;six assurances&quot; to Taiwan made by President Ronald Reagan in 1982, including that the United States would not set a date for ending arms sales to the Taiwanese.</SPAN></P>
