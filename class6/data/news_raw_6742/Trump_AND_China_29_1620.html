<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Over the past two decades, Taiwan has slipped from its position atop the list of flash points in the complex relationship between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. In meetings between President Obama and President Xi Jinping of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it has typically come up after half a dozen more pressing issues, like trade, cyberattacks and Beijing's aggressive moves in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, though, in a single protocol-shattering phone call with the president of Taiwan, President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has thrust it back on the table. Not since President Richard M. Nixon met with Mao Zedong in 1972 -- when the two issued the Shanghai Communiqu&eacute; clarifying the status of Taiwan -- has an American leader so shaken up the diplomatic status quo on the issue. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Taiwan is about to become a more prominent feature of the overall U.S.-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relationship,'' said Jon M. Huntsman, who served as ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during Mr. Obama's first term. ''As a businessman, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is used to looking for leverage in any relationship. A President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is likely to see Taiwan as a useful leverage point.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the short run, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has rattled the entire region. Representatives of several Asian countries contacted the White House on Saturday to express concern, according to a senior administration official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the longer term, officials in the Obama administration worry that the episode could not just ignite tensions across the Taiwan Strait but also inflame trade relations and embolden </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, where it has clashed with the Philippines, Vietnam and other neighbors over competing claims to reefs and shoals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> expressed no misgivings about taking the call from President Tsai Ing-wen, which was arranged beforehand at the initiative of the Taiwanese government, not Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bridled at suggestions that he had committed a faux pas, writing on Twitter on Friday evening that it was ''interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nor did Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or his aides make a gesture to reaffirm the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy, much to the chagrin of the White House. It fell to a spokesman for the National Security Council to affirm that the United States was not changing the policy. Under that policy, the United States formally recognized the People's Republic of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 1979, abrogating its ties with Taiwan, as the Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, sought to bolster </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economy and create closer ties to the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whether Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> views the call as the beginning of a change in approach toward Taiwan is not clear. A person close to him insisted that he was just being polite in taking Ms. Tsai's call. But Stephen Yates, a former deputy national security adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney who is advising the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition, said in an interview that people around Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were well aware of the nuances of American policy toward Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among hard-line Republicans, there has always been a push to confront </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by reaching out to Taiwan. In a statement on Friday, Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican who was briefly believed to be a candidate for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> defense secretary, praised him for taking the call, saying it ''reaffirms our commitment to the only democracy on Chinese soil.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Ronald Reagan antagonized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by inviting a delegation from Taiwan to his inauguration. Aides to President George W. Bush pressed him to take a more confrontational approach with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> until the attacks of Sept. 11 reordered his priorities, increasing the need for him to cultivate </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on counterterrorism and other issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tensions over Taiwan peaked under a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, who in March 1996 ordered two aircraft carrier battle groups into the Taiwan Strait after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> conducted missile tests to intimidate the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For some </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> experts, shaking up the cross-strait relationship would not be the worst thing in the world. ''We have had a status quo of sorts in the Taiwan Strait that has kept the peace, but it recently has not looked all that durable, nor was it very agreeable to most citizens of democratic Taiwan,'' said Orville Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relations at the Asia Society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Whether a new kind of Trumpian brinkmanship will now cause </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to reconsider its hard-line position towards Taiwan, or to respond in a dangerous and militant way, remains to be seen,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has spoken harshly about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, accusing it of concocting climate change as a hoax to undercut American manufacturers, branding it a currency manipulator (when it in fact is trying to prop its currency up), and threatening to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade advisers have also advocated punitive responses to what they portray as unfair Chinese actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A few days after he was elected, however, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, Mr. Xi, and released a statement afterward that said the two men had a ''clear sense of mutual respect.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Taiwan is also likely to seek a closer relationship with the United States. After years of a Kuomintang government, which pursued closer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ties, Taiwan elected Ms. Tsai as its second president from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party. Analysts said that Ms. Tsai, though not a firebrand, was seeking to diversify Taiwan's economic partners and carve out more space for it in international affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There are also lingering questions about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business dealings in Taiwan. The news media there has reported that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization sent a representative to Taiwan to explore building a luxury hotel in a government-backed development near Taipei's airport, though an official with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization said it was not planning any expansion into Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization does not dispute that one of its employees -- assigned to promote hotel sales related to Asia -- was in Taipei, the capital, in October for a work-related visit. The duties of the executive, Anne-Marie Donoghue, include trying to find guests for the company's hotels worldwide, and she is not involved in developing new real estate projects for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For the Chinese government, as for many other governments around the world, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> freewheeling diplomacy poses a challenge. At first, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign minister, Wang Yi, played down the episode, saying it was a ''petty action by the Taiwan side'' that would not upset the longstanding policy of One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But hours later, the Chinese Foreign Ministry lodged a formal complaint with the Obama administration. It urged the United States to ''handle issues related to Taiwan carefully and properly to avoid causing unnecessary interference to the overall U.S.-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relationship.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  David Shambaugh, the director of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy program at George Washington University, said Beijing's measured response made sense. But he said that if the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration took more concrete steps to change time-tested ways of dealing with Taiwan, ''they can expect additional pushback from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>
