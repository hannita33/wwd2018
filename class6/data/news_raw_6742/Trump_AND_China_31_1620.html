<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The man who would be president is also the name behind a string of high-end hotels. Inside his particular brand of luxury.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you were an alien and had just beamed down to Doral, Fla., the gold letters on a Spanish Revival-style building amid 800 acres of golf courses would leave no doubt as to who owns the resort: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">TRUMP</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You might, however, find yourself wondering if this </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fellow is a reality television star, a titan of industry or a vintner. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chardonnay and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sauvignon blanc (about $25 each) line the shelves of the Marketplace Cafe at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Doral Miami. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nail polish sets ($25), glittery </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pouches ($30) and Empire by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> eau de toilette ($62) are sold in a gift shop. A lounge area is replete with framed magazine covers of Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. There he is on Newsweek, mouth agape, pointing at the viewer, beside the words, &quot;You're Fired!&quot; There he is in a tuxedo on the cover of Playboy with Brandi Brandt, a former Playmate, who appears to be clad in nothing more than his suit jacket. And there he is gazing at the camera, chin in hand, on the cover of GQ in an issue about &quot;men who take risks and make millions.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is the 2011 cover of a golf magazine, Fairways and Greens, that really grabs the viewer. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with a golf club at his side, is shown next to the words: &quot;President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turns out, it was a prescient question. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> candidacy has drawn attention not only to his policy positions, but also to everything that bears the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name, including about a dozen high-end hotels and resorts from Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii, to Turnberry Ayrshire, Scotland. This year, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels - the hotel company founded in 2007 by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and three of his children (Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric) - is planning to open </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Hotel &amp; Tower Vancouver, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotel Rio de Janeiro and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Hotel, Washington, D.C. In coming years, the company said it will expand to Asia. And next year, it will introduce a lifestyle hotel brand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name is ubiquitous, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels may not be as familiar to travelers as larger brands with longer histories like Marriott and Hilton. Are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels as big, brash and over the top as the man for whom they're named?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In visits to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> properties in and around New York, Miami and Las Vegas, I set out to see how it feels to be a guest of the man who would be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As you roll across the paths of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Doral Miami in a golf cart emblazoned with a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> crest, bird calls alternate with the thwack of golf balls, and every staff members offers a friendly nod or hello. Acre after acre is manicured with color-blocked flower beds, orderly rows of palm trees and clipped greens where golf luminaries like Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods have trod. A fallen palm frond the size of a surfboard hadn't been on the ground more than a few minutes before an employee pulled up in a golf cart, lifted it onto the roof and drove off, trailing an electric whir, and then, silence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a muggy spring afternoon, and the quietude belied the news that had broken days earlier. A staff member said the PGA Tour, which has held an annual tournament at Doral for more than half a century (the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trumps</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bought the property in 2012), was planning to move it - to Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who last year had choice words for Mexican immigrants, broke the news on May 31 that the Tour is moving: &quot;They're moving it to Mexico City which, by the way, I hope they have kidnapping insurance,&quot; he told Fox News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PGA Tour commissioner said the move was nota political statement. The next day, however, Ricardo Salinas, the chief executive of the Mexican conglomerate that's moving the tournament, tweeted at Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: &quot;You're welcome to join us at the WGC,&quot; he wrote, referring to the World Golf Championships. &quot;Only good things can turn out, if you know the real Mexico.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the PGA Tour may be a thing of the past, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has poured some $250 million into the resort's future. In April, nearly 50 &quot;spa suites&quot; were opened near the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spa, part of the property's extensive renovation. The suites, decorated in rich blues with abstract art that evokes the ocean, include soaking tubs; use of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spa lounge areas; and, in the evening, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the suites (a night in a one-bedroom in June was $425) one finds </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotel Collection products like bath crystals and a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> yoga mat bag, one of several amenities to encourage &quot;wellness.&quot; Gold is used sparingly: Objets d'art and glass boxes for storing jewelry or sunglasses lend an understated glamour. Perhaps it's not surprising then that the spa suites were overseen not by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whose aesthetic is more aligned with opulent hotels in the Middle East and Asia, but by Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, an executive vice president of development and acquisitions for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Admiring a decorative gold sphere, I turned over a nearby vase to see if it had a mark from a designer like Kelly Wearstler or Jonathan Adler. It had a sticker: West Elm. Maybe someone ought to have peeled it off. But I'm glad they didn't: Design trends today mix high and low with abandon; one can picture young d&eacute;cor buffs sharing photos of the suites on Pinterest. The gold sphere was $29 to $39 on WestElm.com; cream and gold coasters on the coffee table were $31 for four. A charming bud vase had a CB2 sticker ($10.95 on CB2.com).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Generally speaking, the hallways and rooms of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels are surprisingly subdued, save for the occasional Trumpian flourish: a gold toilet handle, or chandeliers that appear to have been sized for the &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; giant Wun Wun. Beyond the gold and glossy exteriors and marble lobbies, the private spaces are low-key, decorated in grays, cream and chocolates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That restraint extends to other aspects of the properties. Music at the pools and restaurants is often, refreshingly, not at full volume. And the hotels are nonsmoking, even in Las Vegas, a city where you can burn your paycheck at any number of hotel casinos. Yet </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Hotel Las Vegas doesn't have a casino. Rather, it sells </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> piggy banks for $10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facade of the Las Vegas property is another matter; it's the hotel with the unrepentant Midas touch. The building looks like a bar of gold bullion but, after all, it's Vegas; Mandalay Bay is equally blinding. &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; baseball caps are proffered in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Store ($30) and adorn the bar at the poolside cafe, H2 Eau, amid bottles of vodka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As long as you're going to be thinking anyway,&quot; reads a quote from Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> splashed across a wall-size mirror at H2 Eau, &quot;think big.&quot; The maxim applies to the rooms. My room in Las Vegas, upgraded to a suite at check-in - possibly because the staff is attentive and it was the third time I booked a hotel as a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Card member (the brand's free loyalty program), or because the hotel figured out where I work (I didn't book using a New York Times email or phone number, though I used my name) - included a Sub-Zero refrigerator, a Wolf stove and a Bosch dishwasher. Even at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SoHo New York, the smallest rooms are an impressive 420 square feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The price of admission befits a luxury hotel. The cheapest available room on a July weekend at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Hotel &amp; Tower New York was $563 a night, according to a recent online search. At </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Hotel &amp; Tower Chicago, it was $420 a night. That said, rooms are not always out of reach. For instance, one search turned up rooms at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Hotel Las Vegas for $165 a night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restaurant prices are what one expects at high-end hotels. At BLT Prime at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Doral Miami, ahi tuna was $37; a 16-ounce New York strip steak was $51. The hotels also tend to have cafes and shops with affordable sandwiches and snacks. If, however, you get a yen for, say, the bag of gold </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chocolate bullions in your room at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SoHo, it will set you back $35.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting at a table in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bar at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower New York, the skyscraper used as Wayne Enterprises in the film &quot;The Dark Knight Rises,&quot; Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels customer can't be pigeonholed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have millennials,&quot; she said one spring evening during a reception in conjunction with the N.Y.U. International Hospitality Industry Investment Conference, &quot;people from the entertainment business, entrepreneurs, titans of industry and those at the beginning of their careers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During recent visits to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels, I met men and women on vacation or traveling on business, some with families. Guests spoke English, French, Chinese, Hebrew and more. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels website is available in several languages, including Chinese and Arabic, even as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposes to squeeze </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and bar Muslims from entering the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to describe their guests, staffers at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SoHo said they are chief executives, athletes and actors. The Kardashians have been frequent visitors, though that doesn't necessarily reflect their politics. &quot;I know you like the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hotel, but honestly how do you feel about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> running for president?,&quot; Khlo&eacute; Kardashian's friend, Malika Haqq, asked her in November on their vlog, Ebony &amp; Ivory. Ms. Kardashian replied: &quot;Wha- how does that have to do with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hotel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, no,&quot; she continued, &quot;I don't think he should be president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other celebrity guests have chimed in, too. After Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that he would bar Muslims from entering the United States, Lucy Lawless, who played the title role in the television series &quot;Xena: Warrior Princess,&quot; tweeted: &quot;I used to stay in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hotels. Can never again,&quot; and urged her more than 140,000 Twitter followers to boycott the brand. Recently, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; created a fake commercial for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels with the tagline &quot;We're not to blame!&quot; and apologies to groups Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may have offended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, some companies think Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign has hurt his hotel business. Hipmunk, the travel comparison site, said in May that &quot;while overall Hipmunk hotel bookings have been on the rise year-over-year, that has not been the case with bookings of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels.&quot; The share of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bookings on Hipmunk as a percent of total bookings was down 59 percent year over year. In New York City and Las Vegas, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels' share as a percentage of each city's total hotel bookings tumbled more than 70 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels executives say the brand has never been stronger. Four of its hotels were among the 0.4 percent of hotels that made AAA's Five Diamond list this year. Asked at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidential campaign has helped or hurt the hotels, Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said &quot;it's been an upward trajectory,&quot; adding that it may have been the case without the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind the high-thread-count sheets, there has been controversy, from the bankruptcy of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hotels and casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., to a lawsuit involving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SoHo from buyers who alleged they had been defrauded. More recently, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is suing the chefs Jos&eacute; Andr&eacute;s and Geoffrey Zakarian, both of whom canceled plans to open restaurants in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Hotel, Washington, D.C., because of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments about Mexican immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the family business rolls on. In the fall the company plans to share details about its new lifestyle hotel brand, as yet unnamed. One name it won't have is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Is that because the name isn't good for business? Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said it's because some properties simply aren't right for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brand. It's common, in fact, for hotel companies to spawn brands that don't use their name. Marriott, for instance, has nearly 20 brands, including the Ritz-Carlton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, are </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels as splashy as the man for whom they're named? Only on the surface. Beyond the facades and lobbies there's a feeling of calm and comfort. No smoking. No gaudy colors. Even the service is what one employee called &quot;ghost service&quot; - omnipresent but silent. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, too, is omnipresent. Just not silent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In guest rooms he appears in videos about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels on a television channel in a seemingly never-ending loop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The thing I do best is build,&quot; says Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during one featuring the forthcoming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hotel in the nation's capital, set to open weeks before the United States presidential election. &quot;Better than 'The Apprentice,' &quot; he says. &quot;Better than politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
