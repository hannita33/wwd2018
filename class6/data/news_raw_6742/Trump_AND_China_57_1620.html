<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has already made a significant foreign policy move by speaking on the phone with Tsai Ing-wen, the president of Taiwan. The call shattered decades of diplomatic protocol and raised questions about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Haenle, the director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, is well positioned to gauge Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> action and its consequences. Mr. Haenle is a retired United States Army officer whose interest in East Asia began in the early 1990s, with a deployment to South Korea. He had </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-related military assignments at the embassy in Beijing and the Pentagon before serving on the National Security Council for five years. He was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> director for the council under President George W. Bush and President Obama. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an edited interview, Mr. Haenle shares his thoughts on the United States-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relationship in the context of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Taiwan and North Korea's nuclear program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   What is your assessment of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> phone call last Friday with Ms. Tsai? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> deflected criticism of the call by saying it was Tsai Ing-wen that called him, that seemed to play perfectly into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hands. The next day, the Chinese foreign minister chalked the call up to ''just a small trick by Taiwan.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will likely now be looking for ways to punish Tsai for the incident. Will the president-elect stand up for Taiwan when that happens? This is one of the real concerns of those who have pushed back against publicizing the phone call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   What do you predict for United States-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Taiwan relations in the coming years? When you were on the National Security Council, how was this issue managed, and has the nature of the issue evolved since then?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is difficult to see how Washington, Beijing and Taipei get to a good place on the Taiwan question in the next several years given the leaderships in each capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In my own experience working in the White House during the Chen Shui-bian era, tension in the Taiwan Strait sucked up a lot of the oxygen in the U.S.-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relationship. When tension over Taiwan is at the forefront of U.S.-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relations, it can consume our agenda in a way that prevents us from achieving other important policy objectives, such as making progress on the increasingly dangerous North Korea nuclear issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   What has been the reaction from your Chinese associates after both Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> win in the election and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Tsai phone call?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many Chinese I know had concluded during the campaign that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be good for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> because he would be a transactional and pragmatic leader. Unlike Secretary Clinton, he might not inject human rights and values in the relationship. Chinese assumed based on his campaign rhetoric that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would retreat from Asia, place less emphasis on U.S. alliance commitments and therefore put less strategic pressure on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Tsai call was a reality check. The most common reaction I have heard in Beijing is a Chinese saying: to give up one's illusions. It's increasingly apparent in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration's vision for the Asia-Pacific will likely mean more strategic pressure, not less. This has been signaled not just on the Taiwan issue, but also in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advisers promising to rebuild the U.S. Navy and repeal defense sequestration, and on North Korea, where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has expressed intention to further pressure </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in order to make progress on dealing with the nuclear issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   In the next four years, what do you see as the biggest potential areas of both tension and cooperation in the United States-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relationship?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In my perspective, North Korea is the clearest threat we face in the Asia-Pacific region in the near term. The threat assessment has changed in the past year or two, and there is a growing consensus that this issue will need to be addressed under the next administration through a redoubling of deterrence measures, sanctions and diplomacy. It will be important for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration to explore whether we can work effectively with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on this issue. If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is unwilling to take necessary steps, the U.S. may need to move forward unilaterally and with allies to put in place more robust sanctions and to strengthen missile defense systems in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This question is connected to how we assess the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Tsai phone call. If we consider dealing with the threat of North Korean or Iranian nuclear proliferation as top national security threats facing the United States, we need to account for whether or not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cooperation would be important in achieving those objectives as we outline our strategy in Asia. In that context, it's hard to understand how it would make strategic sense that the Tsai call would be the first thing the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration would seek to do as it builds a strategy that is tied to broader U.S. regional interests and objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   What advice would you give </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on how to handle the relationship? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While we need to compete with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and deal firmly in areas where we disagree or feel that U.S. interests are being undermined, there are many issues in the world tied to U.S. interests that come back to whether or not the U.S. and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can work together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From that standpoint, it will be very important for President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to meet early on with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, and to build a personal relationship with him.</SPAN></P>
