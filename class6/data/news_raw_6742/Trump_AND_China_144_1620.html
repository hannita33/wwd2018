<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON --  President Obama refused to bash </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when he ran for the White House in 2008, which set him apart from other candidates. None of Mr. Obama's would-be successors are showing similar restraint. Some, like Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, are bashing Beijing with gleeful abandon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those distinctions will probably be on the mind of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, Xi Jinping, when he sits down with Mr. Obama here on Thursday for a one-on-one meeting during a nuclear security summit meeting that falls in the middle of America's no-holds-barred political season. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The surge in anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sentiment on the campaign trail will cast a shadow over the Obama-Xi meeting, and it could have ominous consequences for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relationship with the United States after Mr. Obama leaves office. Experts on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the Chinese were taking the vitriol more seriously than in previous elections, viewing it as a gauge of American intentions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Obama is the best they've got, or are going to get,'' said Minxin Pei, professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. ''The real surprise is that he's still holding the line on engagement at a time when the policy is increasingly hard to defend at home.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While tarring </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a predictable election-year tactic, and recognized as such by Chinese officials, experts said there were deeper corrosive forces at play this year, from distrust of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade practices and cyberespionage to a potential military clash in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Chinese are more worried,'' Mr. Pei said, ''because the anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rhetoric is happening not just in a political context but in the context of a deteriorating overall relationship in the last two years.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Republican front-runner, has characterized Chinese leaders as something close to evil geniuses who manipulate their currency and swindle Americans out of their money through bad trade deals. He has threatened to impose a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports, a step that experts said would ignite a full-blown trade war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The greatest debt in the history of the world is what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has done to us,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said at a rally in Las Vegas in January. ''They've taken our jobs; they've taken our money; they've taken everything. They've rebuilt </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with our money.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, is more measured. But she has relentlessly criticized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for its cyberattacks, and last September she said on Twitter that Mr. Xi was ''shameless'' for playing host at a United Nations meeting on women's rights, at a time when the Chinese government had put several prominent female activists in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chinese state news media reacted furiously to Mrs. Clinton's barb, accusing her of being a ''rabble-rouser,'' guilty of ''ignominious shenanigans.'' The Global Times, a Chinese state newspaper, said she was imitating Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> posture in an effort to pander for votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The problem for Chinese leaders is that Mrs. Clinton staked out tough positions on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> even before she began her latest presidential campaign. When she was secretary of state, one of her major diplomatic initiatives was injecting the United States into the dispute between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and its neighbors over disputed reefs and shoals in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. That issue is expected to figure prominently in Mr. Obama's talks with Mr. Xi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Mr. Obama, it is ironic that he has become a friendly face for Mr. Xi. Although he invited the Chinese leader to an intimate summit meeting in Southern California in June 2013, the two got off to a bumpy start, exchanging sharp words over allegations of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cyber-hacking and theft of American corporate secrets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''For some time, the Chinese view was to look past Obama to the next president,'' said Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution. ''But then they decided to stop doing that, which was wise.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2014, the two leaders agreed on ambitious targets for reductions in carbon emissions. That put the relationship on firmer footing, and Mr. Obama invited Mr. Xi for a state dinner, brushing aside calls from Republican candidates to cancel the meeting to protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cyberespionage and currency manipulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Thursday's visit, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> experts said, Mr. Xi is likely to deliver a reassuring message to Mr. Obama. He will probably repeat his statement from last fall that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not intend to militarize the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. The meeting, they said, may be as much about sending a signal to the next president as it is about preserving his ties with the current one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Xi's visit is meant to show that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not an enemy of the U.S.,'' Mr. Li said. ''But the message also is, 'If you don't cooperate with us, that will be your problem, not ours.' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Harsh words during a presidential campaign can have lingering effects. In 1992, three years after the Tiananmen Square massacre, Bill Clinton referred to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders as the ''butchers of Beijing.'' During the 2000 campaign, George W. Bush said the United States should treat </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a ''strategic competitor'' rather than as a ''strategic partner.'' Just months into his first term, in April 2001, he found himself dealing with suspicious Chinese officials after a Navy surveillance plane had a midair collision with a Chinese fighter jet over Hainan Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Mr. Obama ran for president, his two advisers on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, James Steinberg and Jeffrey A. Bader, advised him to avoid anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments. Mrs. Clinton, his Democratic opponent, called on Mr. Bush to boycott the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics to protest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> failure to force Sudan to stop the killing in Darfur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Obama stopped short of that. ''I'm hesitant to make the Olympics a site of political protest,'' he said at the time, ''because I think it's partly about bringing the world together.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is not clear, in hindsight, whether Mr. Obama's gingerly approach paid off with the Chinese. During his first visit to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as president, the Chinese stage-managed his public appearances, allowed no questions after his joint news conference with Hu Jintao, then the president, and refused to broadcast his town-hall-style meeting in Shanghai on state television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his second year, Mr. Obama stiffened his approach to Beijing, and by the time he ran for re-election in 2012, he was announcing a lawsuit against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the World Trade Organization for unfairly subsidizing its auto and auto-parts industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''These are subsidies that directly harm working men and women on the assembly lines in Ohio and Michigan and across the Midwest,'' Mr. Obama said during a campaign rally, adding, ''We will not let it stand.''</SPAN></P>
