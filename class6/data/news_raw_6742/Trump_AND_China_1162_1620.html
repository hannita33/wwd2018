</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">531 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executives used to fear the activist investor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, there is an activist in the White House and many of those same executives have been making pilgrimages to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower and the White House, hoping their business plans don't get swept away by the changes made by the new president. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was clear when he met with business leaders on Monday: Bring back domestic manufacturing jobs or face punishing tariffs and other penalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the same day, he abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, effectively declaring an end to the era of multinational trade agreements. He said the decision would protect American workers, but some worry that such moves will allow </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to fill the economic vacuum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another big issue that these companies are likely to face is how they use repatriated cash if tax reforms are passed in Washington. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made job creation central to his campaign, but many chief executives want to use repatriated cash to do stock buybacks and make deals instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As well as wanting to shape policy in their favor, some of the executives see their visits as a defensive measure -- to avoid the president's wrath later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But between Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the investor class, chief executives may be cornered more than ever, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Drug companies already face clear opposition from Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has said they were ''getting away with murder.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But one of his proposals, to force pharmaceutical companies to bid for the right to sell their products to Medicare beneficiaries, has failed to attract enough support in Congress, especially among his fellow Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yahoo's Delayed Sale</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It has been a long goodbye for Marissa Mayer, the company's chief executive, and it looks like it could get longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yahoo's sale of its core businesses to Verizon, initially intended to close in the first quarter, is now not expected to complete before April, the company said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two disclosures about thefts of sensitive data did not prevent its business from improving slightly at the ending last year. But the breaches are under investigation by a host of government agencies, and Verizon said it was still evaluating their effect on the acquisition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Aetna's Blocked Deal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The health insurance industry faces uncertainty after a federal judge ruled that Aetna's $37 billion acquisition of Humana should not be allowed to go through on antitrust grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The judge said that government regulation would not prevent the combined entity from raising prices or reducing benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, this hasn't necessarily made consolidation less attractive -- insurers view mergers as a way to gain greater clout in negotiations with hospitals and doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The industry is also trying to grapple with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vow to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Although the president and the Republican-controlled Congress have pledged to replace it with something else, the details of what would take its place are unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Banks, too, are on tenterhooks over this deal. There are $101 million in fees at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Coming Up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Alibaba reports its latest quarterly earnings, which will offer a glimpse into how well the company performed on the Singles Day e-commerce holiday.</SPAN></P>
