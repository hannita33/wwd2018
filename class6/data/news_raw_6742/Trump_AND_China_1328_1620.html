</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> S.E.C. SAID TO BE INVESTIGATING TESLA The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Tesla Motors breached securities laws by failing to disclose to investors a fatal crash involving an electric car that was driving itself, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing a person familiar with the matter. The crash killed the driver, Joshua Brown, who collided with an 18-wheeler that pulled in front of him on a Florida highway in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tesla alerted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to the accident and investigated to determine whether the car was using its Autopilot system, but did not disclose the crash to investors in a securities filing. The National Transportation Safety is also investigating whether systemic issues are tied to driverless cars, an agency spokesman said on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The S.E.C. is examining whether Tesla should have disclosed the accident as a &quot;material&quot; event, or a development a reasonable investor would consider important, a person familiar with the matter said. A Tesla spokeswoman asserted that the crash did not require disclosure to investors. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tesla has not received any communication from the S.E.C. regarding this issue,&quot; she said. &quot;Our blog post last week provided the relevant information about this issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crash happened on May 7 and Tesla learned of it soon afterward. It informed auto safety regulators on May 16. In its security filing for its $2 billion stock sale two days later, the company did not disclose the accident.<BR> XEROX SAID TO BE IN TALKS TO BUY R.R. DONNELLEY Xerox is in talks to buy R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons, the owner of the Edgar financial statement wire service, Bloomberg reports, citing people with knowledge of the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xerox plans to separate into two companies by the end of the year and would merge some of R.R. Donnelley with its copier and printer business. The rest would be merged with its smaller business outsourcing services, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A deal could be announced before Xerox's split is completed. R.R. Donnelley had also announced plans to split into three publicly traded companies, but a deal with Xerox would negate that plan. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xerox and R.R. Donnelley reportedly saw the opportunity of a merger after the deal between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Computer Sciences bolstered both companies' share prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xerox has a market value of about $9.6 billion, while R.R. Donnelley is worth about $3.9 billion.<BR> ON THE AGENDA Daniel K. Tarullo, of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, will speak at the Center for American Progress in Washington about shadow banking and how the nation can avoid the next crisis at 9 a.m. The House Financial Services Committee will hold a hearing on the Financial Choice Act at 10 a.m. and a hearing on online marketplace lending at 2 p.m. The president of the Minneapolis Fed, Neel Kashkari, will hold a town hall at Northern Michigan University at 5 p.m.<BR> REGULATOR WARNING OVER BANKS' PROPERTY LENDING Thomas Curry, comptroller of the currency, used a biannual financial risk report to issue a warning over looser underwriting standards and concentrations in banks' commercial real estate portfolios, The Financial Times reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His alert added to concerns that bubbles may be forming in parts of the country's property market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Curry suggested that these loans were of greater concern than car loans and lending to already indebted companies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While leveraged lending and auto lending remain concerns, CRE lending and concentration risk management has become an area of emphasis for regulators,&quot; he said in a speech, referring to commercial real estate lending. &quot;Our exams found looser underwriting standards with less-restrictive covenants, extended maturities, longer interest-only periods, limited guarantor requirements, and deficient-stress testing practices.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His remarks come after the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said they would pay special attention to banks' commercial property lending. In spite of these concerns, banks have been expanding in this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercial real estate loans originated by banks in the first quarter jumped 44 percent from the same period in 2015 and banks' share of these loans has risen from over a third in 2014 to more than half in the first quarter of 2016.<BR> Contact amie.tsang@nytimes.com</SPAN></P>
