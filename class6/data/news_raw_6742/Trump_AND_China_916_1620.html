<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At his first postelection news conference, at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower on Wednesday, President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> served up the same mix of boasts, taunts and promises that set the political world on fire and kept fact checkers busy last year. On hacking, trade agreements, drug companies and health insurance, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stayed his ground in facts at times, and took liberties at others:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hacking </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think it was Russia. But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After months of casting doubt on American intelligence agencies finding that the Russian government had hacked Democratic targets and leaked private emails to influence the election, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> now appears to accept the fact that Russia was responsible. But by suggesting -- with justification -- that others engage in hacking, he minimized the significance of the Russian attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He noted that the Chinese are believed to have obtained records on more than 20 million current and former United States government employees. But the Chinese did not release the records, while the Russians went beyond conventional spying to deliberately interfere with the democratic process. SCOTT SHANE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business and Taxes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he could legally run his business and serve as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Legally, the president and vice president are exempt from conflict-of-interest provisions that apply to other federal employees. So Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is correct that he could do both, but questions about the appearance of conflict of interest would plague his administration, hurting his efforts, even if his involvement in business deals were not illegal. ERIC LIPTON</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said most Americans ''don't care at all'' that he hasn't released his tax returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Pew Research Center poll this month showed that 60 percent of Americans think Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should release his returns; only 33 percent said he does not have a responsibility to do so. The poll, consistent with earlier surveys, found a partisan split: Nearly four in five Democrats said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should release his returns, but just 38 percent of Republicans did. NELSON D. SCHWARTZ</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jobs and Trade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Divine intervention aside, this will be a tough one to fulfill in many ways. Economists have long debated just how much impact a president has on job creation. While Washington can set the tone, other forces like the business cycle, demographics and overseas events are just as powerful as who is in the Oval Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> biggest challenge is that the economy is close to full employment -- unemployment is less than 5 percent -- and growth remains in the 2 percent range. For Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to create jobs as President Bill Clinton did in the 1990s, the economy would have to grow by 3 to 4 percent annually -- a prospect that is far-fetched, according to most economists. NELSON D. SCHWARTZ</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This might be popular with voters, but tough to get done. Congress would have to approve a border tax -- the president has more latitude when it comes to tariffs on individual countries -- but do not count on smooth sailing for new taxes on Capitol Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Republicans may control the White House, the House and Senate, many G.O.P. members of Congress remain allergic to the ''T word,'' even if the tax is aimed at protecting domestic jobs and is being proposed by a Republican president. NELSON D. SCHWARTZ</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''A lot of car companies are going to be moving in'' and ''a lot of industries are going to be coming back.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ford canceled a new factory in Mexico; Fiat Chrysler will expand in the United States. While auto companies seem to be adjusting plans to placate Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, less consumer-oriented industries continue to move jobs to cheaper places like Mexico. NELSON D. SCHWARTZ</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Health Care and Prescription Drugs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  United States drug companies ''supply our drugs, but they don't make them here, to a large extent.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This reflects the reality of a global pharmaceutical industry. The Food and Drug Administration says that ''the amount of foreign-made drug products in the United States is rapidly increasing.'' The F.D.A. has deployed inspectors in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> India, Europe and Latin America in an effort to ensure that imported drugs are safe and effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pressure from the government can make a difference. Pfizer had been planning to move its headquarters to Ireland, but scrapped the plan last year after the Obama administration changed American tax rules. ROBERT PEAR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're going to save billions of dollars'' on drugs through competitive bidding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is a crowd-pleasing promise and may be feasible. Members of both parties are concerned about sky-high prices for some prescription drugs. Some government agencies do purchase drugs by inviting competitive bids. More bidding and savings are possible -- where comparable drugs are available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, some highly effective, expensive drugs have no competition because no equivalent or similar therapies are available. In such cases, it is difficult for the government to command or negotiate discounts. Officials have been reluctant to use their ultimate weapon: refusing to cover or purchase an expensive drug. ROBERT PEAR</SPAN></P>
