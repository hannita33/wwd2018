<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Obama commuted most of the sentence of Chelsea Manning, the Army intelligence analyst convicted of providing classified information to WikiLeaks that revealed U.S. military and diplomatic activities overseas. She will be free in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision will most likely come up at Mr. Obama's final news conference today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said that the much publicized, yet unverified, memo on President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ties to Russia was &quot;fake.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With just days left as commander in chief, President Obama has to decide whether to move ahead with plans to arm Syrian Kurdish fighters battling the Islamic State for the long-awaited assault on Raqqa, the group's de facto capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he supports the Kurds, he risks further alienating Turkey. If he doesn't, he risks the Islamic State holding on to its base for plotting terrorist attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prime Minister Theresa May charted a &quot;clean break&quot; for Britain from the European Union in her landmark speech yesterday: regaining control of immigration, even if it means losing E.U. trading advantages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uncertainty remains over the fate of the 3.2 million E.U. citizens living in Britain and the 1.2 million Britons living in other E.U. countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicola Sturgeon, first minister of Scotland, said Ms. May's speech made a second Scottish independence referendum &quot;more likely.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pursuing protectionism is just like locking oneself in a dark room,&quot; he said. &quot;While wind and rain may be kept outside, so are light and air.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oval Office is often used as shorthand for the U.S. presidency, but did you know that fewer than half of the presidents have worked there?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During President Theodore Roosevelt's term (1901-09), the West Wing was added to hold the executive branch's growing staff. He had a rectangular-shaped office in the addition (now called the Roosevelt Room).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier leaders worked in the residence, mostly in what is known as the Lincoln Bedroom. Roosevelt's successor, William H. Taft, had the Oval Office built and was its first occupant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The design wasn't novel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Washington had oval-shaped rooms in Philadelphia in 1791, allowing him to greet guests circled around him. The pomp mimics an English court tradition called the lev&eacute;e.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a White House precursor, too. The Blue Room is rounded and used for diplomatic receptions. In the family quarters, there's a Yellow Oval Room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Christmas Eve in 1929, the Oval Office was badly damaged in a fire. President Franklin D. Roosevelt renovated it, moving it closer to the residence. The &quot;commute&quot; is under a minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidents can redecorate, but there are limits. One is that the presidential seal must remain on the ceiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there's another tradition: The departing president leaves a letter on the desk for his successor.</SPAN></P>
