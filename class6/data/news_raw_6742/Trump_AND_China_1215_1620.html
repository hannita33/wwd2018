<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Many are piling on Yahoo after its disclosure of another hacking, but the business seems to be stabilizing.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it finally time to stop beating up on Yahoo?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easy to pile on with the criticism after another hacking, but according to the Deal Professor, Steven Davidoff Solomon, the business is stabilizing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yahoo still has more than one billion monthly active users, which makes it seem like a bargain at $4.8 billion. By comparison, Snap has 150 million users, but it could go public at a $25 billion valuation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Verizon wanted to walk away, it might have difficulties doing so legally. A Delaware court would look at whether the breaches had a material adverse effect, something it has never found to exist before. The cost of intrusions at other companies have cost little relative to the billions of dollars they make in annual revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, that does not mean Verizon cannot get a discount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is likely to request as much information as possible to make Yahoo nervous. According to the mergers and acquisitions playbook, it could eventually claim that Yahoo is not complying with the information requests. This alone could shave a billion or two off the deal price, a rounding error in comparison to Yahoo's market capitalization of $36.9 billion, and be done with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Deal Professor is rooting for Yahoo to stand firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Yahoo stands firm right now and no new bad facts come out,&quot; he writes, &quot;Verizon will have to close or be forced by a court to do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazilian Companies Settle Bribery Case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political corruption investigation into Petrobras, which has roiled Brazil, has moved past the country's borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States and international authorities are expected to announce one of the largest corruption fines ever in a case involving two Brazilian companies, according to people briefed on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Odebrech, the construction company that built Miami International Airport, and Braskem S.A., an affiliated petrochemical firm, are expected to settle bribery charges for $3 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the United States, the settlement would be the largest penalty in a case involving a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bond Market Issues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prices for government and corporate bonds in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have tumbled, spooking investors and prompting the government to temporarily restrain some trading and make emergency loans to struggling financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A healthy bond market is crucial to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> restructuring plans: The country has been relying on it to bring market discipline to the economy. Chinese companies need the money to cope with a slowdown in growth, but the price drops and rising yields have pushed borrowing costs higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there could be more to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The adjustment has not yet finished,&quot; said Miao Zuoxing, a partner at the FXM Brothers Fund, in Shanghai. &quot;It will continue and normalize until money is put where the government can see it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quotation of the Day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are basically drawing a line in the sand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- John P. Boyd, a lawyer in Columbia, S.C., explaining the rules of a state program providing protections against pollution-related liabilities. The rules aim to prevent a polluter from evading liability by using another company to stand in its place. They also mean that when Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the president-elect, bailed his eldest son out of a business deal gone bad, he may have ended up with a costly environmental cleanup in return.</SPAN></P>
