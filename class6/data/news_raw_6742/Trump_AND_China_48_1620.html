<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is one thing Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seems sure about, it is that the United States is getting a raw deal from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To people who spend time studying the United States' economic relationship with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accounting of its dysfunctions contains both legitimate, accurate complaints and elements that completely misstate how things work between the world's largest and second-largest economies. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They're killing us,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said in many debates, rallies and television appearances. He has threatened to put a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports ''if they don't behave.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If you take Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments at face value, as president he would try to renegotiate a complex set of ties that has pulled hundreds of millions of Chinese out of dire poverty, made a wide range of goods available to American consumers at more affordable prices and contributed to the decline of American manufacturing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here is a reality check on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arguments. (It's also a way to understand the economic relationship between the countries.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Trade Deficit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We have very unfair trade with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. We're going to have a trade deficit of $505 billion this year with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.'' -- Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  America's trade deficit with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was $338 billion last year, and there's no reason to think it would swing by as much as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggests in 2016 -- but what's $167 billion among codependent trading partners? (Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seems to be conflating the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> number with the $505 billion total American trade deficit in 2014, which was first reported to be that much.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The central point, that the United States imports a lot more from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> than it exports, is correct. To put it a bit differently, from 1999 to 2015 annual imports from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rose by $416 billion. In the same span, American exports to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rose by $145 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That said, many economists would argue that a trade balance shouldn't be viewed as a simple scorecard in which the country with the trade deficit is the loser and the one with the surplus the winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So the question isn't whether there is a persistent, large trade deficit between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but why. And that leads to another arm of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> argument, and one of the stronger ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Market Access</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. They can't. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won't let them.'' -- Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's not that American multinational companies -- heavy industry, technology or finance -- can't do business in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Rather, their executives complain of Chinese government restrictions that they see as arbitrary, unpredictable and highly favorable to domestic companies -- so much so that in practice they are either shut out or can't make money in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Doing business in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> typically requires a partnership with a Chinese company, and that often means sharing crucial intellectual property that can enable the partner to become a competitor down the road. The rules of engagement can change capriciously, especially for American and European companies, rendering major investments worthless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American business interests have a long list of complaints: that the Chinese government uses its enforcement of antimonopoly rules to favor its domestic businesses; that the government subsidizes exports through tax rebates and other practices; that automakers can set up factories within </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> only as part of joint ventures and face stiff tariffs in trying to sell cars made in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States government has pushed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on these ''market access'' issues for years. But the situation seems to be growing worse, at least in the opinion of American executives. The American Chamber of Commerce in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> regularly surveys its members about business conditions, and this year 57 percent of executives surveyed named ''inconsistent regulatory interpretation and unclear laws'' as a top problem, up from 37 percent in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Currency manipulation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They are the single greatest currency manipulator that's ever been on this planet.'' -- Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> complaint about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> devaluation of its currency has a long, bipartisan tradition. It is also out of date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is true that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intervenes in currency markets to influence the price of its renminbi against the dollar. And it is true that a decade ago, both the American government and independent economists tended to think that the interventions served to depress the currency, in the Chinese government's deliberate effort to make its exports more price competitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a lot has changed in the last decade. The renminbi was allowed to rise sharply from roughly 2006 to 2015, and is up 23 percent from a decade ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And since last summer, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has let the currency drop some, but that appears to be an example not of manipulation, but of letting the price of the currency fall closer to the rate that reflects </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fundamentals given the country's slowing economy. The International Monetary Fund has argued that the renminbi, also known as the yuan, is no longer undervalued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''At least in 2006, 2007 or 2008, the yuan was undervalued -- now it's probably not,'' said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and chief economist of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beige Book, an information service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, the Chinese government has been trying to restrict capital from flowing out of the country to stop the renminbi from falling any further. It would seem that the Chinese government and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are, for the moment at least, on the same side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Manufacturing Decline</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What will happen if they don't behave, we will put on a tax of some amount, and it could be a large amount, and we will start building those factories and those plants. Instead of in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, we'll build them here.'' -- Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> broader argument is that a generation of unfair economic relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (and also Mexico, Japan and others) is a primary cause of the troubles of American workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mainstream economists are more sympathetic to this view now than they were even a few years ago. Traditional trade theory holds that the losers from global trade -- factory workers who lose their jobs when that factory moves overseas -- are more than compensated by other opportunities created by a more efficient economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New scholarship suggests that the pain from globalization in certain geographic locations may be longer-lasting. One study found that Chinese imports from 1999 to 2011 cost up to 2.4 million American jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That said, it's easy to assign too much of the blame for the collapse of manufacturing employment to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or trade more broadly. Hundreds of millions of workers across the globe -- many of whom were in dire poverty a generation ago -- have become integrated into the world economy. That's a lot of competition, all in a short span, for American factory workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, factory technology has advanced so that a company can make more stuff with fewer workers. The number of manufacturing workers in the United States has been declining as a share of all jobs nearly continuously since 1943, and the total number of manufacturing jobs peaked in 1979; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade with the United States didn't really take off until the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In other words, trade has been an important economic force over the last few decades, and the deepening of the United States' ties with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is one of the most important developments in global economics of the last generation. But to look at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the sole force affecting the ups and downs of American workers misses the mark.</SPAN></P>
