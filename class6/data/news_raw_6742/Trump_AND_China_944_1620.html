<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Russia has acknowledged that its officials carried out one of the biggest conspiracies in sports history: a far-reaching doping operation that tainted the entire Olympic movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was an institutional conspiracy,&quot; said Anna Antseliovich, the acting director general of Russia's national antidoping agency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she and others continued to deny that the government's top officials were involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a show of defiance toward President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has belittled the notion of global warming, California's governor, Jerry Brown (above at his family ranch), and legislative leaders say they will work directly with nations and other U.S. states to fight climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inauguration on Jan. 20 is shaping up to be a challenge, with security officials worried that protesters will flood the capital, along with what may be nearly a million supporters of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas P. Bossert, a top national security aide under President George W. Bush, will be Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> adviser for homeland security and counterterrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carrie Fisher, the actress and author who brought a rare combination of nerve, grit and hopefulness to her most indelible role, as Princess Leia in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies, died at 60.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a look at Ms. Fisher's life beyond the intergalactic franchise. Our critic says her legacy &quot;may rest at least as much on her literary voice&quot; as on any character she played onscreen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan visited Pearl Harbor with President Obama, offering repentance but not apologizing for his country's attack in 1941. &quot;We must never repeat the horrors of war again,&quot; Mr. Abe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alliance between the former enemies may soon be tested by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has grumbled about Japanese trade barriers and the cost of U.S. military support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The wealthiest members of the extended Saudi royal family own French chateaus, stash money in Swiss bank accounts, wear couture dresses under their abayas and frolic on some of the world's biggest yachts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But decreased oil revenue is straining the economy and forcing questions about whether the family can maintain its lavish lifestyle and its unchallenged grip on Saudi Arabia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Consumer Confidence Index in the United States shot to its highest level since mid-2001, driven by high expectations for the economy under Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luxembourg has tightened tax rules, bowing to E.U. pressure to crack down on corporate tax avoidance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gazprom, the Russian state energy giant, filed proposals with the European Commission aimed at resolving an antitrust inquiry into how it sells natural gas on the Continent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year has produced some momentous events, so let's take a moment and look back at some of the words they inspired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's decision to leave the European Union started many discussions about &quot;post-truth&quot; politics. Its rise in use prompted Oxford University Press to name it word of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Postfaktisch&quot; is Germany's top word of 2016, according to the Society for the German Language. The organization, a state-sponsored agency, bases its yearly choices on significance, rather than frequency. Third place went to &quot;Silvesternacht,&quot; or New Year's Eve, which has taken an unpleasant meaning since hundreds of women in a German city were attacked as they celebrated the end of 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the Atlantic, Merriam-Webster chose &quot;surreal,&quot; which it says was trending in moments of crisis this year. People who saw &quot;The Lobster,&quot; including our movie critic, used it in the original sense, to describe artistic expression, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a word Austria is celebrating stands out among them all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The yearlong campaign for the presidency, which nearly gave the country its first far-right leader since World War II, was the basis for the &quot;postponement of the repeat runoff of the election of the federal president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's otherwise known as &quot;Bundespr&auml;sidentenstichwahlwiederholungsverschiebung.&quot;</SPAN></P>
