<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;With authoritarian leaders on the rise, democratic values are increasingly threatened.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama is devoting much of the last foreign trip of his term to reassuring European allies that Washington will maintain its security commitments under Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and stay true to its democratic principles. Before leaving Washington, he met with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and said the president-elect &quot;expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships,&quot; including &quot;strong and robust NATO&quot; partnerships.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that message won't be credible unless and until the world hears it directly and unequivocally from Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who spent months on the campaign trail disparaging NATO and insisting that its members pay more for their own defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not the only worry in Western democracies, which now seem threatened by authoritarian leaders on all sides. A photo circulating on social media shows that the leadership of the United Nations Security Council could soon be made up of: the autocratic Vladimir Putin of Russia and Xi Jinping of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the nationalist, far-right Marine Le Pen, if she wins the election in France next year; the ever-shifting and volatile Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Theresa May, the untested British prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Western leaders in that group would be a far cry from those who, from the wreckage of World War II, built the trans-Atlantic community, promoted shared values of tolerance and human rights and created the network of institutions, like NATO, that have kept the peace and contributed to economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No wonder that Mr. Obama and others are not missing a chance to speak out about core democratic values. On his first overseas stop in Greece on Wednesday, Mr. Obama said: &quot;Our democracies show that we are stronger than terrorists, fundamentalists and absolutists, who cannot tolerate difference ... who try to change people's way of life through violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such assurances are necessary because of the forces shaking the alliance and European unity - the migration to Europe of huge numbers of refugees fleeing Syria and other conflicts, a rise in xenophobia and nationalism, economic stagnation and Mr. Putin's expansionist moves in Ukraine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama, in an essay co-written with Chancellor Angela Merkel for a German newspaper, implicitly rebutted the agenda laid out in Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign with a plea for more trans-Atlantic cooperation on everything from security and climate change to globalization and the defense of a more inclusive and interdependent world. The joint essay not only underscored Mrs. Merkel's role as a leader of Europe but suggested that she alone among present world leaders seems capable of succeeding Mr. Obama as standard-bearer for Western democracy. Mrs. Merkel is under increasing pressure at home, however, because of a populist tide and anti-immigrant sentiment, and is facing elections next year.</SPAN></P>
