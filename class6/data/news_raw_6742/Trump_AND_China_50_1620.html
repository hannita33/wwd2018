<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election of Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as president of the United States has shocked the world -- and has the potential to reshape it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone -- all people and all other nations,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in his victory speech. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His triumph was seen as good for Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, but made some in Mexico nervous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Leaders from Asia, Europe and Latin America offered congratulations to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or to the United States, but the distinctions in their messages were noteworthy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some Advice From South of the Border</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Latin American heads of state wished Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> well, and offered their own ideas on how he might govern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Venezuela, a country that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has repeatedly criticized for its leftist leadership, asked Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to essentially mind his own country's business by ''respecting nonintervention in internal issues and to the right of development and peace.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Juan Manuel Santos, the president of Colombia and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said he hoped Colombia and the United States ''will continue deepening bilateral relations.'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has criticized a trade agreement between Colombia and the United States, among many other trade deals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &Aacute;lvaro Garc&iacute;a Linera, Bolivia's leftist vice president, said the voters' endorsement of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> populist message shows how Americans, too, are questioning prevailing economic paradigms in ''a passive revolution,'' this time coming from the right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Others expressed dismay with the election entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The excesses of this eccentric millionaire have proven that the number one enemy of the U.S. is not beyond its borders, but rather within,'' wrote Vladimir Fl&oacute;rez, a Colombian cartoonist popularly known as Vladdo, in El Tiempo newspaper. ''This threat called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a product of American society; a nightmarish mutation of the American dream.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign -- and his promise to build a wall on the United States-Mexico border and to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally -- became a rallying point for Mexicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has promised to blow up the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, upending commerce between the two countries, valued at about $500 billion a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Early on Wednesday -- as the peso gyrated -- President Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto said, ''Mexico and the U.S.A. are friends, partners and allies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Andr&eacute;s Manuel L&oacute;pez Obrador, a popular leftist politician and likely 2018 presidential candidate, asked Mexicans ''to remain calm,'' and said, ''We will stay together no matter what the circumstances are.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu repeated in a television interview on Wednesday morning that Mexico would not pay for the wall.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Mauricio Macri had rooted for Hillary Clinton but said he hoped to work with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''One of the issues that worried us is the transition,'' he said. ''We will have to adapt, and that is what we will do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Earlier in the week, Foreign Minister Susana Malcorra warned that a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory would bring relations between the United States and Argentina ''to a standstill,'' but on Wednesday she praised his ''conciliatory'' victory speech.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trudeau Affirms Canada's Friendship</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who enjoys a close relationship with President Obama, said that ''Canada has no closer friend, partner and ally than the United States.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added, ''The relationship between our two countries serves as a model for the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promise to revisit Nafta brings unwelcome uncertainty to Canada's economy. Mr. Trudeau's open approach to immigration and refugees is the inverse of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. And Canada will be in a difficult position if it imposes carbon taxes only to find that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> undoes all American efforts to mitigate climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the few positive developments for Canada is Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promise to reverse the Obama administration's decision to block the Keystone XL pipeline.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From the U.N. and NATO, Reminders of America's Role</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, said it was ''worth recalling and reaffirming that the unity in diversity of the United States is one of the country's greatest strengths.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As if to remind the United States of its role as a guarantor of world stability, he noted that it is ''an essential actor across the international agenda.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has demanded that the NATO allies of the United States foot more of the bill for their collective defense. Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, noted that the alliance comes with legal obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''NATO's security guarantee is a treaty commitment and all allies have made a solemn commitment -- a solemn commitment -- to defend each other,'' Mr. Stoltenberg said. ''We have to remember that the only time that we have invoked Article 5, our collective defense clause, is after an attack on the United States, after 9/11.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anxiety in Europe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The two top officials of the European Union -- Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission --  congratulated Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and invited him to visit Europe. ''Europeans trust that America, whose democratic ideals have always been a beacon of hope around the globe, will continue to invest in its partnerships with friends and allies, to help make our citizens and the people of the world more secure and more prosperous,'' they wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later, however, Mr. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, warned that Britain's decision to leave the European Union, and the election of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, should raise alarms. ''The events of the last months and days should be treated as a warning sign for all who believe in liberal democracy,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of a prominent group of lawmakers in the European Parliament and a former prime minister of Belgium, called Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory ''a wake-up call for European leaders,'' adding, ''Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has declared several times that our priorities are not his.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added: ''We cannot be dependent anymore on the U.S., we have to take charge of our own destiny. Europe should get its act together, too, and set its internal differences aside.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Britain's prime minister, Theresa May, spoke of the country's ''enduring and special relationship'' with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande of France noted that ''some of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign positions must be put to the test of the values and the interests that we share with the United States.'' He added that ''disorders in the world are worrying people everywhere, including the people of America, the first world power.'' The French prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, asked, ''What will become of the Paris agreement on the climate, of the nuclear deal with Iran that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to reconsider?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chancellor Angela Merkel congratulated Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and offered her cooperation -- but stressed that it must rest on human rights and nondiscrimination. Germany's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said that ''if Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> really wants to be president of all Americans, then I think his first duty is to fill in the deep rifts which arose during the campaign.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Americans are taking their country back,'' Mr. Wilders, a lawmaker who leads the Party for Freedom and who faces hate-speech charges in his home country, wrote on Twitter.

She called it ''good news for our country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, one of the few European leaders who spoke favorably of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during the campaign, wrote on Facebook: ''What a great news. Democracy is still alive.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Iran Vows to Maintain Nuclear Agreement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has called the January agreement between Iran and world powers ''the worst deal ever,'' and he has vowed to unilaterally abandon it. Under the agreement, Iran has given up large chunks of its nuclear program in exchange for some sanctions relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The head of Iran's atomic energy program told the semiofficial Tasnim news agency on Wednesday that the country would ''try to continue to implement the nuclear agreement.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said last week that the presidential debates had illustrated ''the crisis America is in.'' Some analysts said the election of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the result of an ''awakening,'' Iran's ideological label for some of the Arab Spring revolts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One analyst, Farshad Ghorbanpour, who is close to the government of the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said he feared the implications for Mr. Rouhani, who has been promoting better relations with Washington. ''Our hard-liners will pressure him, they are very happy now,'' he said.-- THOMAS ERDBRINK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Netanyahu Calls </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'a True Friend' of Israel</SPAN></P>

The United States is Israel's most important ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Israeli government, which has often had a tense relationship with the Obama administration, has studiously avoided taking sides, but at the same time, Jerusalem has moved to improve relations with India and Russia, and is in talks to develop economic ties with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Uncertainty for a Middle East Already in Tumult</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Across the Middle East, where the United States has a long history of often divisive involvement, many seemed to have no idea how to react to the election of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Prime Minister Binali Yildirim of Turkey quickly congratulated Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but official reaction was scarce from Saudi Arabia. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the kingdom may no longer be able to count on American defense guarantees and should give the United States ''free oil for the next 10 years.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Syrians, too, said they had little inkling what the vote would mean for the civil war in their country, although many in the opposition had expressed hope that a victory for Hillary Clinton would mean more robust support for the rebels fighting to topple President Bashar al-Assad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I am scared, scared for Syria,'' said Murhaf Jouejati, the chairman of the  Day After organization, an independent body that aims to prepare Syrians for a democratic future. ''Here is a man who is openly saying that he is going to defer to the Russians on Syria. This is a clear victory for the Assad regime.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many have expressed worry that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> negative statements about Islam and Muslims would translate into aggressive policies in the region, as well as making it harder for displaced Syrians to seek refuge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Japan, Anxiety From an Ally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who had been planning to meet Mrs. Clinton in Washington in February, tried to calm his country, as the yen surged and stocks stumbled. ''Hand in hand with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, we will try to work together,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the campaign trail, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> singled out Japan. He claimed that Tokyo was not paying its fair share to support United States military bases, calling into question the American commitment to defend Japan in case of attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A rising </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could put a check on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stated ambitions in Asia. ''Maybe he will decrease the commitment to Pacific security issues,'' said Shin Kawashima, professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo. ''But if he carries out such a policy, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be much more authoritative and aggressive in the Pacific. And then most of the alliance countries and security experts in Washington will be against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policies. It is a little difficult for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to just change all the old policies.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''North Korea should not misjudge the solidity of our alliance with the United States and our joint ability to respond'' to provocations, said Jeong Joon-hee, a government spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unsettled South Koreans when he said that he might withdraw American troops from their country unless Seoul paid more for their presence. He also indicated that he might let Japan and South Korea protect themselves with nuclear weapons and that he might negotiate directly with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> surprisingly strong performance caught analysts off guard, but it was welcome news for those in South Korea who believe that their country must build its own nuclear weapons to defend against North Korea.</SPAN></P>
