<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZHENGZHOU, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- A vast, boxy customs center acts as a busy island of commerce deep in central </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government officers, in sharply pressed uniforms, race around a maze of wooden pallets piled high with boxes -- counting, weighing, scanning and approving shipments. Unmarked trucks stretch for more than a mile awaiting the next load headed for Beijing, New York, London and dozens of other destinations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The state-of-the-art facility was built several years ago to serve a single global exporter: Apple, now the world's most valuable company and one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> largest retailers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The well-choreographed customs routine is part of a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that supports the world's biggest iPhone factory, according to confidential government records reviewed by The New York Times, as well as more than 100 interviews with factory workers, logistics handlers, truck drivers, tax specialists and current and former Apple executives. The package of sweeteners and incentives, worth billions of dollars, is central to the production of the iPhone, Apple's best-selling and most profitable product.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It all centers on Zhengzhou, a city of six million people in an impoverished region of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple's manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Locals now refer to Zhengzhou as ''iPhone City.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The local government has proved instrumental, doling out more than $1.5 billion to Foxconn to build large sections of the factory and nearby employee housing. It paved roads and built power plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It helps cover continuing energy and transportation costs for the operation. It recruits workers for the assembly line. It pays bonuses to the factory for meeting export targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All of it in support of iPhone production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We needed something that could really develop this part of the country,'' said Li Ziqiang, a Zhengzhou official. ''There's an old saying in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: 'If you build the nest, the birds will come.' And now, they're coming.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American officials have long decried </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> support of its state-owned companies, calling the subsidies and other aid an unfair competitive advantage in a global marketplace. But the Zhengzhou operation shows the extent of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> effort to entice overseas multinationals to set up production facilities in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Local and provincial officials, in an effort to create jobs and drive growth, have courted manufacturers with incentive packages that make it easier and cheaper to do business. Beijing, for decades, has encouraged such efforts at the national level, by developing special economic zones that offer tax breaks to multinationals and exempt them from costly and cumbersome rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In this way, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not unlike other countries, including the United States, where states and cities vie for companies. To compete in the era of globalization, multinationals, which face pressures from shareholders and customers, must seek the best opportunities, increasingly by relying on a highly interconnected supply chain spread across the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the reasons behind their choices are not always transparent. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the competition for companies is secretive and rarely exposed to public scrutiny or debate -- and it is often focused on manufacturing partners, rather than multinationals themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lure is strong. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Samsung have all flocked to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to lower their production costs, bolster their bottom lines and tap into the world's largest consumer market. And many rely on local manufacturing partners like Foxconn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Apple came later than many technology companies, it now generates nearly a quarter of its revenues from sales in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and has some of the fattest profit margins in the business. As such, the Zhengzhou operation provides an especially illustrative look at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> importance to American technology companies -- and specifically iPhone production and more recently, Apple's consumer sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A 32-gigabyte iPhone 7 costs an estimated $400 to produce. It retails for roughly $649 in the United States, with Apple taking a piece of the difference as profit. The result: Apple manages to earn 90 percent of the profits in the smartphone industry worldwide, even though it accounts for only 12 percent of the sales, according to Strategy Analytics, a research firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is difficult to tally the total value of government benefits for the Zhengzhou operation, or to determine the exact effect on the profits of Foxconn or Apple. The subsidies aren't disclosed by the Chinese government or Foxconn. They aren't available in public records. And Apple says it was not a party to Foxconn's negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The confidential government records obtained by The Times detail multiple meetings over several years in which Zhengzhou city officials discussed their ''support'' for iPhone production, calling the benefits a ''preferential policy.'' The records offer a snapshot of those benefits, including the specific aid for Foxconn in multiple areas, like infrastructure, labor, taxes and exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> largest private employer, Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has enormous leverage in the negotiations for those incentives. The company's size and scale -- and the sway that they afford in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- is connected to Apple. Foxconn is Apple's largest supplier. Apple is Foxconn's largest customer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The two companies are intertwined in Zhengzhou. When the factory opened, Apple was Foxconn's only customer here. Even now, the American technology company accounts for almost all of the production at the Zhengzhou plant, where about half of the world's iPhones are made. Apple is also the main exporter using the customs facility here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In response to questions, Apple said it was aware of the government's infrastructure support. But the company added that it had no knowledge of specific grants, subsidies or tax breaks given to its manufacturing partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Foxconn, in a separate statement, said it was grateful for the support of the government, noting that it was ''no different than similar tax breaks all companies get in locations around the world for major investments.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A growing backlash against globalization puts Apple and other big multinationals directly in the sightlines of two increasingly combative giants: the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has vowed to bring down the full force of the government on American companies that move jobs overseas, threatening punitive tariffs on the goods they sell back at home. Apple has been a frequent target of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who said during the campaign that he would get the technology company to ''build their damn computers and things in this country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, is growing less tolerant and more suspicious of Western influence, particularly American technology companies and the huge influence they have over Chinese consumers. A state-owned publication called Apple one of the ''guardian warriors'' that have ''seamlessly penetrated'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and may pose a threat to national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, no longer content with just being the world's factory floor, is moving aggressively to develop its own technology giants. Beijing is pressuring local governments to cut subsidy programs that the country heartily encouraged even just a few years ago. And big exporters, courted and protected for decades by Beijing, now face broad scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Regulators shut down Apple's iTunes Movies and iBooks Store last spring, just six months after the services were introduced in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The Chinese authorities fined the technology giant for failure to fully pay its taxes. And Apple went through a national security review in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the iPhone 6, delaying its release in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Apple is now engaged in the corporate version of shuttle diplomacy. In December, the company's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, along with other Silicon Valley executives, met with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in New York, part of an effort to build bridges with the incoming administration. It followed a similar good-will tour in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in August, when Mr. Cook sat down with the country's vice premier at Zhongnanhai, the government's walled leadership compound in what was once part of Beijing's Imperial City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The two countries are playing a high-stakes game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Apple, like many multinationals, depends on a vast global supply chain that includes multiple companies and countries, each with its own expertise and advantages -- a complexity that is often lost in the political debate over trade. The iPhone is a collection of intricate parts that are made around the world and assembled in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, spurring employment in many countries; Apple says it supports two million jobs in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States both brandish a new form of economic nationalism, they risk disrupting the system, without necessarily achieving their goals. And multinationals and their manufacturing partners would face serious financial trade-offs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the Zhengzhou operation shows, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not only provides a large pool of labor; it also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the United States or anywhere else. The trove of benefits in Zhengzhou flows through the production process for the iPhone, from the factory floor to the retail store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Foxconn receives a bonus when it meets targets for exports. Those subsidies, according to the government records, totaled $56 million in the first two years of production, when the factory was exclusively dedicated to the iPhone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bonus is small on each of the tens of millions of iPhones produced during that period. But the subsidies add up: The government records list more than a dozen other forms of financial aid at the Zhengzhou operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Zhengzhou government eliminated corporate taxes and value-added taxes that Foxconn pays for the first five years of production; they are half the usual rate for the next five. The city lowered Foxconn's social insurance and other payments for workers, by up to $100 million a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The customs operation is also in a so-called bonded zone, an area that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> essentially considers foreign soil, subject to different import and export rules. This setup allows Apple to sell iPhones more easily to Chinese consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pursuing the iPhone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Apple was late to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a bid to lower costs, some of the biggest American technology companies, including Compaq, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, began dismantling their domestic manufacturing in the 1980s and moving work overseas, largely to Asia. Not Apple. The company's co-founder, Steven P. Jobs, believed that software and hardware development had to be closely integrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rather than close plants, Apple decided to build them -- in Colorado, Texas and California. Apple would maintain some of them long after Mr. Jobs left the company in 1985. The plants were highly automated, with the walls painted white, just as Mr. Jobs liked them, and they were promoted as a symbol of American ingenuity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is a machine that is made in America,'' Mr. Jobs trumpeted in 1984, after Apple opened a manufacturing facility in California to produce the Macintosh personal computer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Finances forced Apple to change course. As Mac sales plummeted and inventories began to bulge in the mid-1990s, Apple had to embrace outsourcing, something with which it had only just experimented. After Mr. Jobs returned to the company in 1997, he turned to his new operations chief, Mr. Cook, who had recently joined from Compaq, to figure out how.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under the direction of Mr. Cook, Apple shifted more business to Foxconn, then an up-and-coming Taiwanese contract manufacturer that had started to gain a following among big American brands like Compaq, IBM and Intel. The partnership freed up Apple to focus on its strengths -- design and marketing. Apple would come up with a new idea, and Foxconn would find ways to produce millions of units at a low cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They have brilliant tooling engineers, and they were willing to invest a lot to keep pace with Apple's growth,'' said Joe O'Sullivan, a former Apple executive who worked in Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Apple's sales took off after the introduction of the iPod in 2001, Foxconn had the heft and expertise to meet the demand that accompanied each hit product. Foxconn's factories could quickly produce prototypes, increase production and, during peak periods, hire hundreds of thousands of workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Foxconn's founder, the Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou, provided political clout. Over the years, he frequently visited </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to meet local officials and members of the decision-making Politburo to lobby for subsidies, cheap land, workers and infrastructure for facilities that churned out iPods, iPads and iPhones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The reason Foxconn's so big is Terry Gou,'' said Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped design the iPod. ''He said he'd create the manufacturing, and the Chinese government would give him some of the money to do it. As Terry grew with the Apple business, no one else could compete.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After the first iPhone was rolled out in 2007, Foxconn moved to expand production and began scouting new locations around </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- unleashing a fierce competition among cities eager for the business. Officials from various regions camped out at hotels in Shenzhen, where Foxconn had its main operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''These have become like Olympic competitions,'' said Gao Yuning, who teaches public policy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Zhengzhou government saw the factory as a huge opportunity for development in an area that had been bypassed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> boom. Officials wanted to rebrand a place derided as a source of migrant laborers and unfairly tarnished as a land of thieves and counterfeiters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  City officials lavished money and favorable investment terms on Foxconn, according to the government records. They promised discounted energy and transportation costs, lower social insurance payments, and more than $1.5 billion in grants for the construction of factories and dormitories that could house hundreds of thousands of workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The city created a special economic zone for the project and provided a $250 million loan to Foxconn. The local government also pledged to spend more than $10 billion to vastly expand the airport, just a few miles away from the factory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We know that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has all sorts of policies to promote development, and this one ticks all the right boxes,'' said Barry Naughton, an authority on the Chinese economy at the University of California, San Diego.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The city moved quickly. Factories were built, licenses were approved and assembly lines began operating in August 2010, just a few months after the government signed the deal. In Zhengzhou, the Chinese government effectively took a huge tract of land on the barren, dusty plains of central </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and transformed it into a sprawling industrial park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I was impressed,'' said Jeff Williams, Apple's chief operating officer, who was part of the early discussions about setting up a factory. ''They were very focused.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Made, and Sold, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Apple first moved into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the country was largely a low-cost production site. It quickly evolved into one of the world's biggest consumer markets, with more than a billion potential customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Apple initially had to take the ''Hong Kong U-turn'' to get its products into the hands of Chinese consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began opening its economy to the outside world in the 1980s, the government's policies have encouraged manufacturing and exports with the creation of special economic zones. But those same policies have discouraged domestic consumption of overseas brands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most products made in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by big multinationals had to be physically shipped out of the country and then brought back so that they could be taxed as imports -- hence, the U-turn employed by many companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2005, Apple's best-selling portable music device, the iPod, was manufactured in southern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. To comply with the country's stringent rules, iPods were loaded onto a cargo ship and sent to Hong Kong. Often, when the ship arrived, it was simply turned around and sent back to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This was really a legacy of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> old export-oriented economy,'' said Edwin Keh, the former head of global procurement at Walmart, who worked for the retailer and other multinationals in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for 20 years. ''Back then, we built supply chains good at making things in the East and selling them in the West.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Apple and other multinationals wanted a better system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By the time Apple released the iPhone in 2007, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> faced growing pressure to loosen its restrictions and give global companies easier access to its market. Apple and other companies believed that shipping goods to Hong Kong was a waste of time and energy. They wanted to send goods from the factory gate in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> directly to their stores and distribution centers inside the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In discussions with Zhengzhou officials, Foxconn insisted that the operation be located inside a bonded zone, equipped with customs right at the factory gate to facilitate iPhone exports. It also wanted the factory to be built within a few miles of the city's airport, to expedite Apple's global shipments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although it wasn't the first city to create such a cohesive operation, Zhengzhou provided a convenient system, since it would serve what would become the world's largest iPhone manufacturing facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A bonded zone functions much like a diplomatic territory, in that the government regards it as foreign soil. The zone eliminates the need for global brands to pay duties or taxes on imported components. And it makes it unnecessary to physically export the goods. In those zones, products can be imported and exported virtually at customs, without crossing a single border. After that, they can move swiftly around the country, or out to the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the final assembly point for the iPhone, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also functions as a base for Apple's global tax strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the Zhengzhou bonded zone, typically at customs, Foxconn sells the finished iPhones to Apple. After purchasing the iPhones, Apple then resells the goods to Apple subsidiaries. The process largely takes place electronically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The process also plays out with other Apple goods that are produced in the country. Apple can assign some profits on these goods to an affiliate in Ireland, a tax-advantageous locale, according to a 2013 American congressional report on the company's tax practices. It is a practice commonly employed by many big technology brands and is not unique to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''U.S. multinationals are the world leaders in tax avoidance strategies,'' said Edward D. Kleinbard, the former chief of staff of the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. ''In doing so, they create stateless income -- income that has become unmoored from the countries to which it has an economic connection.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to the congressional report, the process allowed Apple to move tens of billions of dollars offshore and substantially reduce its tax bill, which one senator called the ''holy grail of tax avoidance.'' The European Union in August ordered Ireland to claw back more than $14.5 billion from Apple in unpaid taxes from a decade-long period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Apple said it follows all applicable tax rules, insisting that the company pays all its taxes. The company said it had made some changes to its tax procedures to comply with new laws, including registering a subsidiary in Ireland that previously had no tax jurisdiction. It is appealing the ruling in the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Zhengzhou, local officials have lauded the package of incentives provided to Foxconn, confident that the city's iPhone production will continue to pay huge dividends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In August 2014, the city's top leaders held a special meeting to discuss ''deepening collaboration'' with Foxconn, according to the government records obtained by The Times. They crowed that Zhengzhou was the ''biggest production base for Apple iPhone worldwide.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There were 94 production lines producing the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s, and the government said about 230 million smartphones had already been exported from Zhengzhou, making it one of the nation's crucial export centers. Production capacity had reached half a million iPhones a day. The city's tax revenue was rapidly rising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials had a name for it all: ''Zhengzhou Speed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A State-Recruited Army</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A crushing work force begins arriving for the early shift at 6:30 a.m. They travel by foot, by bus, by motor scooter and even by pedicab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They file steadily into dozens of factory sites, spread out across 2.2 square miles. At the peak, some 350,000 workers assemble, test and package iPhones -- up to 350 a minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Apple's labor force, the size of a national army, relies heavily on the generosity of the Zhengzhou government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As part of its deal with Foxconn, the state recruits, trains and houses employees. Provincial officials call townships and villages to ask for help finding potential workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Every city's department of labor and ministry of human resources is involved,'' said Liu Miao, who runs a private recruiting center in Zhengzhou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The government pays recruiters a subsidy for every worker they hire, Mr. Liu said. ''If the demand is high, then they will pay more,'' he said. ''If the demand is low, then the payment will be low, too.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cities like Zhengzhou have handed out subsidies to manufacturers in the hope of driving economic gains. But increasingly those local interests don't align with the national agenda, creating a raft of uncertainty for multinationals operating in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the economy slows, Beijing has started to shift its development path away from manufacturing and exports and toward innovation and consumption. It wants to empower Chinese brands and foster homegrown technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To advance its cause, Beijing has started to rethink the investment policies that support overseas companies. In November 2014, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State Council, the country's cabinet, directed local governments to evaluate and eliminate any preferential treatment, including subsidies and tax breaks that benefited multinational exporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The threat prompted a pushback, mostly notably by Foxconn which, along with other international businesses, fought to keep existing incentives. Since then, Beijing has backed off the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the broad trend lines are clear: Overseas companies will no longer get the welcome they once received. The Chinese government is tightening access to its huge market and pressuring Western technology companies to advance domestic goals -- in a coordinated action that one congressional study in the United States called a new form of ''techno-nationalism.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The government wants to know what you can give to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' said James McGregor, who lives in Shanghai and has for decades advised American companies operating in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''And they have the market and the muscle. They're not playing around anymore.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chinese regulators have been penalizing overseas companies, like the American mobile chip giant Qualcomm, which was forced to reduce prices for companies that sell smartphones within the country. It is a market increasingly dominated by Chinese brands like Huawei and Xiaomi that undercut Apple and Samsung on price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is also scrutinizing Western technology companies over national security issues. Beijing has increased oversight of the internet with new cybersecurity rules and forced state companies to reduce spending on overseas technology. It pressed Apple to hand over its source code. Apple said it refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Apple has agreed to the government's request to store more of its local data on Chinese servers. It must also undergo ''security audits'' on new models of the iPhone before gaining approval to sell the product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beijing also expects American companies to help develop </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> own capabilities. Apple is teaming up with UnionPay, a state-backed financial services company. It has invested $1 billion in the Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, which has significant backing from state companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Cook, Apple's chief executive, has also carefully cultivated Apple's image as a big employer, a good corporate citizen and a major economic contributor. He comes to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> regularly. He has donned factory uniforms and walked the assembly line in Zhengzhou. He has courted regulators, the heads of state telecom giants and the country's top leaders, including Mr. Xi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview with Chinese state television last year, Mr. Cook explained how Apple was planting trees in the country, calling the effort a ''pillar of its environmental strategy.'' He detailed plans to build a massive solar project to power Apple's stores, headquarters and offices throughout the country. He also boasted about creating over three million jobs in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, half of them in manufacturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the Hall of Purple Light in the government's walled leadership compound in Beijing, Mr. Cook promised in August to build the company's first research and development center in the country and to support the government's big focus on high-end manufacturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Opposite him sat the vice premier, Zhang Gaoli. Beside him sat his partner. There was the chairman of Foxconn, Mr. Gou. Also present was the party leader of the province where Zhengzhou is located, Xie Fuzhan.</SPAN></P>
