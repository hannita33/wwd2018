<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Jin Liqun, who runs the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, says Faulkner helped him understand complex human relationships.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING - As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was opening up 40 years ago, Jin Liqun was an ambitious young academic fascinated by 20th-century American literature and other Western works. In the fragile era after Mao's death, the freedom to indulge in such texts was a heady experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Faulkner's novels in particular stuck with Mr. Jin, now the president of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a major force in the country's rush to secure a leading role in the world's financial architecture. An underlined copy of &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot; is on his office bookshelves, along with Shakespeare and the Bible. He said he found inspiration in Faulkner's complex human relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I look at the literature of the U.S. to get a sense of humanity's adaptation to nature - conquering is a wrong term,&quot; he said. &quot;You cannot conquer nature; you have to come to terms with nature, you have to cohabit with nature, and you have to cohabit with other species in this world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration refused to join the bank when it opened at the end of 2015 with a surprising number of members, including the European powers and the major Asian countries, except Japan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Mr. Jin seems prepared to maneuver in the treacherous terrain between Beijing and Washington. His goal, he said, is to steer the bank toward building infrastructure across Asia in a way that is environmentally friendly and free of corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jin, 67, gray-haired and slightly rumpled, was at ease in a recent interview at the bank's temporary headquarters in Beijing's financial district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his sparsely furnished office, guests are seated at the head of a long table, with the host alongside them. That makes meetings seem more like affairs of equals, rather than a hierarchy with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the top, as some bank members fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't hurt relations with outsiders, particularly Europeans, that Mr. Jin has edited a two-volume anthology of English verse that starts with Chaucer and concludes with Seamus Heaney. Asked his favorites, he chooses T. S. Eliot, Ted Hughes and Dylan Thomas. Then he adds one more. &quot;Ezra Pound is great, though he is a little bit controversial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Group of 20 meeting in Hangzhou last year, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, Xi Jinping, made it clear that no one should forget the bank is led by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He singled out Mr. Jin for praise. That was an unusual public accolade by a Chinese leader to one of his foot soldiers, a signal that Mr. Jin had the full backing of the Chinese government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delicately, Mr. Jin chose another interpretation. &quot;I think he was giving me a warning: 'You have to do your job well because all eyes are on this bank.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jin has tried to persuade skeptics in Washington that the bank is not a Chinese hegemon, at least not for now. He has smoothed prickly attitudes by agreeing to cooperate with the workhorses of the 70-year-old American-dominated Bretton Woods system - the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, he seems aware that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-led bank is likely to prosper under a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration that has shown little signs of interest in the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed to an article he wrote before Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won the presidency. &quot;The U.S. risks forfeiting its international relevance while stuck in its domestic political quagmire,&quot; he wrote, adding, &quot;History has never set any precedent that an empire is capable of governing the world forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jin has none of the family lineage that counts in getting to the top in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He is not a princeling, the rank that confers privilege on Chinese leaders by virtue of being a descendant of the revolutionary leaders of the Mao era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he likes to stress that he was born at a propitious moment for the Communist Party. The Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek had fled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> east coast and the Communists were in control by the time he was born in Changsu, a river port city in Jiangsu Province, in August 1949.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was born under the red flag,&quot; he said with a big smile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father was an accountant, his mother a textile worker, and his grandfather, who lived with the family, was disabled from a work accident. The eldest child of five, he was left to handle the household while still in primary school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tried to be a little leader of my siblings,&quot; he said. &quot;I never beat my brothers or sisters. I started to learn to cook when I was 9.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was still in high school when the chaos of the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, and like all students at the time, he was corralled to become a Red Guard. After a brief stint, he retreated to the countryside, a decade-long journey that left an indelible impression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He joined the peasants in the fields during the day. At night, he studied at a makeshift desk forged from a discarded blackboard and four bamboo sticks. He devised a strict curriculum for himself, and devoted himself to mastering written and spoken English, via BBC radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the Cultural Revolution, he enrolled in the postgraduate English literature program at the Beijing Foreign Studies University in 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There, he came under the wing of Prof. Wang Zuoliang, a dedicated teacher of English-language authors. When Mr. Wang returned from a trip to the Adelaide Festival in Australia in 1980, he encouraged Mr. Jin to translate &quot;The Tree of Man,&quot; a novel about man's battle with nature by Patrick White, the Australian Nobel laureate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had just joined the World Bank. Because Mr. Jin was fluent in English, the Finance Ministry plucked him out of academia to join the office of the executive director for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at the World Bank in Washington. He had translated five chapters of White's book, but dropped everything to serve his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stint in Washington led to a career at the top echelons of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> financial machinery: He was vice minister of finance, and later chairman of the supervisory board of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investment Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the while he kept up his interest in things Western. In 1998, his daughter, Keyu, asked to leave home at 14 to live with an American family in New York and attend school there - a revolutionary idea for a Chinese family at the time. Mr. Jin's experience abroad prepared him for sending his only child away, Keyu Jin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My father was able to let me go,&quot; said Ms. Jin, 33, now a tenured assistant professor of economics at the London School of Economics, and a popular figure on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> social media. He set an example, she said, by always &quot;reading and writing and listening to classical music after work. We never watched television.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beneath his diplomatic finesse, Mr. Jin is fiercely patriotic. Under the bank's rules, a Chinese does not automatically succeed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his expectations are clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would hope a Chinese can succeed me, and I hope we have competent Chinese people to succeed me in the future,&quot; he said, before heading off to a meeting with a delegation that was too big to fit around the table in his office.</SPAN></P>
