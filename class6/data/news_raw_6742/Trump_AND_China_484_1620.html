</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to shake up both relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and regulatory issues, and he's not doing it by halves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has named: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Peter Navarro, a strident critic of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to lead a new White House office overseeing American trade and industrial policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Carl Icahn, the investor, to serve as a special adviser on regulatory issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Navarro, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, is the only credentialed economist in Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inner circle. He has argued that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is effectively waging economic war by subsidizing exports to the United States and impeding imports from it. He has also made a documentary called ''Death by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' in which an animation of a Chinese knife stabs a map of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some economists actually say that automation is a bigger threat to people's jobs than globalization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The appointment highlights a division among Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like Mr. Navarro, Wilbur Ross, the president-elect's choice for commerce secretary, favors increased trade restrictions. But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> broader circle of advisers is dominated by proponents of free trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Icahn, who made his fortune as a ''corporate raider,'' will play a role in the selection of a new leader for the Securities and Exchange Commission. That is the regulator that serves as the referee for his battles with corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His appointment has renewed concerns about conflicts of interest in the administration. It comes just as the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization has resolved labor disputes that could have posed other conflicts for the president-elect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of those labor agreements provides a union contract to workers at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Hotel Las Vegas (the hotel had previously refused to bargain with the union). The second agreement eases a hurdle to unionization at a recently opened </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hotel in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Eric </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also said that he had decided to stop directly soliciting contributions for his charitable foundation because he recognized that his status as the president-elect's son means that donors could try to use him to gain access to his father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  F.B.I. Leaks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It looked to be another prominent insider trading case brought by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it could be undone because a federal agent leaked confidential information to reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  William T. Walters, the Las Vegas sports bettor, was charged with using illegal stock tips, but the judge in the case essentially instructed Mr. Walters's lawyers to file a motion to dismiss the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The case has been marred by revelations that a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation leaked details of the inquiry to reporters at The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times two years before Mr. Walters was indicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the charges are dismissed, it would be another stunning legal victory for Mr. Walters. He has faced charges before, mostly arising from his gambling business, but has not been convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Quotation of the Day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Odebrecht and Braskem used a hidden but fully functioning Odebrecht business unit -- a 'Department of Bribery,' so to speak -- that systematically paid hundreds of millions of dollars to corrupt government officials in countries on three continents.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  -- Sung-Hee Suh, the deputy assistant attorney general of the criminal division of the Justice Department. The companies pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in Brooklyn to charges that they paid hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Calpers Cuts Targets</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  California's state public pension system, Calpers, voted to lower expectations for its investment returns in a move that would increase pressure on town and city budgets across the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With $300 billion in assets and the investments of more than 1.7 million current and future retirees under management, it is the biggest public fund outside the federal government. Other pension systems may well follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Calpers is also changing its business plan so that it covers less of the cost of pensions. Local governments and public workers will have to chip in more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The shift by Calpers to 7 percent, from 7.5 percent, will do little to satisfy critics of its methodology who argue that the expected returns should be based on safe investments like Treasury securities, which are nearer the 2.5 percent mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Coming Up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   The Commerce Department publishes data that will give an idea of the economy's underlying strength and some indication as to whether the Federal Reserve will move again soon on interest rates.</SPAN></P>
