</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">692 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Hillary Clinton have very different approaches to taxation, but when it comes to spending, they both seem to agree on one thing: improving the nation's infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is in line with a growing number of economists who see upgrading infrastructure as a way to invigorate the economy. For example, spending on new buildings and equipment has been weak partly because that depends on improvements in the nation's transportation network and pipelines. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But, as ever, there is still debate on how much should be spent, and who will pay for it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Spend too little and the nation's backbone could deteriorate, costing more money in repairs. Spend too much and risk crowding out private investment, pushing up inflation and interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lawrence H. Summers, who served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, argues that America's need for better infrastructure is so great that the country could increase its debt load and still come out ahead. Others argue funding should come from increased taxes or budget cuts elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Either way, and regardless of who wins in November, there is some optimism that a public works push is coming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Two Sets of Books for Public Pensions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Once again, it comes down to who is going to pay -- but this time, it involves public pensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There are two competing ways of valuing a pension fund, and that means two sets of numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The debate over the two sets has raised concerns that governments nationwide do not know the true condition of the pension funds they are responsible for, meaning millions of people are exposed to risks they have no way of knowing about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It turns out the cost of providing a steady, guaranteed income for life is large -- alarmingly so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Take, for example, California and its renowned public pension system, Calpers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Calpers keeps two sets of books to show the full cost today of providing -- the officially stated numbers, known as the actuarial approach, and the ones that reflect the market value. The market value is not publicly disclosed and paints a much more troubling picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as even the relatively modest actuarial value of the pension fund (a calculation of the cost of providing a pension for life geared toward helping employers plan stable annual budgets) has grown, some local governments have struggled. Doubtful that they can really afford their pension plans, they have told Calpers that they want out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Calpers, in turn, has calculated the market value of the pension promises and, in some cases, the discrepancy between the two values has been a rather nasty surprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Citrus Pest Control District No. 2, a fund serving just six people that wanted to convert itself to a 401(k) plan, the district ended up settling the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tax Breaks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's our third case of who pays, but at least this time, we know the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manhattan real estate empire has relied on a huge amount of government and taxpayer assistance. He has reaped at least $885 million in tax breaks, grants and other subsidies for luxury apartments, hotels and office buildings in New York, according to city records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The subsidies enabled him to lower his costs and sell apartments at higher prices because of their reduced taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No possible subsidy was left untapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In one case, after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lined up a $150,000 grant for one of his buildings near ground zero. That took advantage of a program to help small businesses in the area recover, even though he had acknowledged on the day of the attacks that his building was undamaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''His whole M.O. is to exploit the government for everything he could get,'' said Jerilyn Perine, the city housing commissioner during the Giuliani and Bloomberg administrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Quotation of the Day</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  -- Sebastian Heilmann, president of the Mercator Institute for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Studies, a think tank based in Berlin, on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strategy of investment.</SPAN></P>
