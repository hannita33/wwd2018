</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the campaign trail, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has promised to do quite a few things that are beyond the powers of an American president, like billing Mexico for a border wall. But when it comes to foreign trade, his powers as president would come closer to his expansive ambitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As president, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could seek to penalize other nations for undercutting American manufacturers or stealing American ideas. He could also pursue congressional legislation to impose a 45 percent tariff, or tax, on imported Chinese goods, as he has proposed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The bottom line, some experts say, is that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might well be able to squeeze </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That does not mean, however, that his punitive approach would ease America's economic pains. In fact, a range of experts agree that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposals are more likely to deepen those problems, particularly if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or other targeted nations retaliate, rather than accept his demands.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Starting a trade war might be cathartic for workers who have lost jobs, but it is unlikely to create a lot of factory work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There's no way a tariff of this kind could deliver the kind of benefits that he's talking about, and it's quite wrong to think that the big problem for American workers has been foreign trade,'' said J .W. Mason, a professor of economics at John Jay College and a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank. ''But I think it could be very destructive for the rest of the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> views on trade are among his oldest and steadiest public policy positions. He has long maintained that other countries are taking advantage of the United States because Americans spend more money on foreign goods than the rest of the world spends on American goods. And he has long argued for slapping higher tariffs on those foreign goods in order to fortify the American economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trade was the first policy issue Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mentioned last Tuesday in a speech after his latest round of victories in five northeastern primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Our jobs are being sucked away from our country, and we're not going to let it happen anymore, folks,'' he said at a victory party in New York that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It emerged again Wednesday in Washington during what was billed as a major foreign policy speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This Tuesday, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hopes to sweep the delegates in Indiana and all but sew up the Republican nomination. Nowhere has trade figured more centrally than in the Hoosier State, where the air-conditioner maker Carrier opted to move operations to Mexico, becoming a recurrent feature in Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> anti-free-trade litanies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has prospered over the last few decades by focusing its economy on low-cost manufacturing for foreign markets. Exports to the United States soared, particularly after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. American businesses and consumers bought $481.9 billion in Chinese goods in 2015, about one-fifth of all imports and the most from any country. But manufacturing employment in the United States has fallen sharply. A 2013 study estimated that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rise had eliminated at least one million domestic factory jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the current campaign, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has proposed a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports and a 35 percent tax on Mexican imports. He has also proposed tariffs on goods that specific American companies produce in foreign countries, including Carrier air-conditioners and Ford cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said the threat of such tariffs would persuade </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, for example, to modify the economic policies that he describes as providing unfair advantages to Chinese companies. Rather than incur his wrath, he says, American companies would be persuaded to keep more of their factories close to home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The 45 percent is a threat that if they don't behave,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said at a Republican debate in Miami last month, the United States ''will tax you.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added: ''It doesn't have to be 45; it could be less. But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As president, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would have some latitude to reverse a course that the nation has pursued for decades. But the results could be troublesome on multiple fronts. The removal of trade barriers has played a significant role in reducing global poverty and encouraging peace between nations, achievements that could be eroded by tit-for-tat backsliding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The basic principle is that a sovereign state enters trade agreements of its free will, and it can get back out,'' said Robert Howse, the Lloyd C. Nelson professor of international law at N.Y.U. School of Law. ''But that's the easy part.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Imposing sweeping tariffs would reverse a mainstay of United States foreign policy. Beginning after World War II, the United States gradually reduced its import taxes and pushed other nations to do the same, seeking not only to promote increased trade but to prevent conflict. The United States now imposes average weighted import tariffs of just 1.4 percent, according to the World Bank, among the lowest rates in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under existing laws, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could impose tariffs only on specific categories of imports, not whole countries, and only by demonstrating specific violations of trade rules, such as export subsidies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There are at least 50 sets of laws and regulations that exist that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has, at least in spirit, crossed the boundaries,'' Sam Clovis, an adviser to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would have the difficult task of proving that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is breaking the rules before the World Trade Organization, which polices global commerce. International trade laws limit the type of help governments can provide to companies, but the role of the Chinese government is particularly opaque, said Mark Wu, a professor of law at Harvard and a former United States trade negotiator in the administration of President George W. Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economy is its own beast, and it has a form that was not envisioned at the time these rules were created 20 years ago,'' Mr. Wu said. ''W.T.O. rules are not necessarily equipped to address all of the problematic aspects of that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inc. system as far as American exporters are concerned.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In fact, one of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> favorite charges, that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other nations are suppressing the value of their currencies, is actually not a violation of existing trade agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A central problem is defining currency manipulation in a way that excludes the United States -- in particular, the Federal Reserve's post-recession stimulus campaign, which had the effect of weakening the dollar much in the same way that other countries do to their currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alternatively, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could pursue the radical option of seeking legislation to impose a broad </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tariff, in effect demolishing the rules of global trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It would be a flagrant violation,'' said Alan O. Sykes, a professor of law at Stanford and an expert on international economic relations. ''There is no prior violation of W.T.O. law that would be even close.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The impact of such legislation would touch almost every aisle at Walmart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2015, Americans bought $14.2 billion worth of Chinese shoes, $2.5 billion of Chinese jewelry and $593 million of Chinese rugs. And, most of all, cellphones -- $64 billion worth, according to the Commerce Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All told, the United States imported $481.9 billion in Chinese goods in 2015, a record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But research suggests that the price of Chinese goods would rise by significantly less than 45 percent because companies would hold the line to preserve their market share. Consumers can also buy comparable goods. When the United States imposed a 35 percent tariff on Chinese tires in 2009, imports of tires from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declined while imports from Indonesia, Mexico and Thailand rose sharply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For the same reasons, however, economists see little chance that a tariff would achieve Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> goal of encouraging domestic production. They say it is even less likely to create large numbers of new factory jobs. American manufacturing output is at the highest level in history and employment has fallen because of large gains in efficiency, a trend that is unlikely to reverse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could retaliate by imposing its own tariffs. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> responded to the tire tariff, for example, by imposing a tariff on American chicken parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States sold $116.2 billion in goods to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2015, including aircraft parts, automobiles and semiconductors -- high-value industries in which workers earn high wages. Losing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> market could mean sacrificing better jobs for less desirable ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Doug Oberhelman, chairman and chief executive of Caterpillar, described higher tariffs as ''very dangerous'' in February. ''We're 5 percent of the world population,'' said Mr. Oberhelman, who spoke in his capacity as president of the Business Roundtable, a pro-trade lobby. ''Ninety-five percent of our potential customers are elsewhere. We've got to learn and figure out how to deal with that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The damage to international trade agreements could also have deep and enduring consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the central benefits of the current system is that it separates trade disputes from other kinds of conflict. The global effort to reduce tariffs after World War II ''was dreamed up as a way to prevent world wars,'' said Mr. Howse, the N.Y.U. professor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That should not be forgotten.''</SPAN></P>
