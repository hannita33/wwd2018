</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FRONT PAGE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article on Friday about President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign-style rally in Cincinnati misstated the size of the audience that greeted him. It numbered in the thousands, not the tens of thousands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A picture caption on Thursday with the continuation of an article about manufacturing jobs in the Midwest misstated in some editions the relationship between the women pictured. Arnita Gray and Carol Bigbee are co-workers at Carrier in Indiana; Ms. Gray is not Ms. Bigbee's daughter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article on Nov. 5 about the chaos of war in the government-held side of Aleppo, Syria - held out by President Bashar al-Assad as safer than the rebel-held side - misstated the surname of name of a man who died at Al Razi hospital in Aleppo while his mother wailed. He was Hazem Sharifa, not Sherif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INTERNATIONAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article on Nov. 4 about the death of two American soldiers and more than 30 Afghans in heavy fighting in Kunduz misstated, in some editions, the month that Taliban insurgents nearly overran Kunduz for a second time. It was October, not November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article on Nov. 3 about fears in Hong Kong that Beijing would issue a rare interpretation of Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, to effectively bar two newly elected separatist lawmakers from taking office referred incorrectly, in some editions, to four past interpretations of the Basic Law by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> legislature. Only one of those interpretations came at the request of Hong Kong's highest court; it is not the case that they &quot;customarily&quot; followed such a request. (Four days after the article was published, the Communist Party moved to bar the lawmakers.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">METROPOLITAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article last Sunday about New York's disappearing diner culture misidentified the music club at 97th Street and Columbus Avenue that was replaced in the 1990s by the Central Park Cafe/Restaurant. It was Mikell's, not Michael's Pub. Michael's Pub, where Woody Allen used to play clarinet, was on East 55th Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUSINESS DAY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An article on Thursday about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rethinking of its methods to fight counterfeit goods misstated the given name of a hunter of fake goods. He is Yu Fengxing, not Yu Fengsheng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPORTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The On Baseball column on Friday about Major League Baseball's new collective bargaining agreement described incorrectly, in some copies, how the Yankees would receive a break on their revenue-sharing bill under the deal. A multiplier on revenue based on market size and prior revenue rankings was eliminated; the Yankees did not receive a deduction of their stadium financing costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of an editing error, a picture caption with an article on Thursday about Chris McCullough, who has bounced between the Brooklyn Nets and the Long Island Nets this season, misidentified him in some copies. He is in the center of the photo taken during a game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Los Angeles Clippers - not on the far left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Associated Press report on Monday about the Rangers' 2-0 loss to the Ottawa Senators misstated, in some copies, the number of saves Ottawa's Craig Anderson had. It was 33, not 32.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">T: HOLIDAY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A picture caption with an entry in the &quot;This and That&quot; feature on page 66 this weekend about the pop-up events Petit h is hosting at Herm&egrave;s's Manhattan boutiques misspells the surname of a designer who works with the line. He is Christian Astuguevieille, not Astuguevielle.</SPAN></P>
