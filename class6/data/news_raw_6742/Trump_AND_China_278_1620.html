<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> extended a warm welcome this week to the incoming United Nations chief, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, praising the world body and making clear that it wants a greater role there, at a time when Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election to the White House has many wondering whether American involvement will recede.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supported Mr. Guterres in his campaign for secretary general, and President Xi Jinping, who met with him in Beijing on Monday, hailed the United Nations' work and noted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> support for the Paris Agreement on climate change. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has suggested that he will withdraw the United States from the accord. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Guterres's visit, which ended on Tuesday, was another chance for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to promote its growing role in global governance, on matters as varied as the nuts and bolts of peacekeeping to high-level forums like the Group of 20 economic summit meeting, which was held in September in the Chinese city of Hangzhou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to step in and make the international system work,'' said Baohui Zhang, a professor of political science at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. ''Xi wants to present </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the new force that will sustain the post-World War II architecture by becoming the indispensable power.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, Dr. Zhang said, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is building its own parallel structures, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a response to the World Bank. During his visit, Mr. Guterres said the new bank was a welcome addition to the international system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Xi praised the United Nations with unusually strong language for a Chinese leader, calling it ''the most universal, representative and authoritative intergovernmental international organization.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Guterres, who becomes secretary general on Jan. 1, has also met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia since winning the United Nations' top job, but he has yet to meet with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The American president-elect has chosen Nikki R. Haley, the governor of South Carolina, who has little experience in foreign affairs, to be his envoy to the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign to enhance its role at the United Nations dates from September 2015, when Mr. Xi made his first visit to the annual General Assembly meeting in New York. There, he pledged that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would establish a permanent peacekeeping force of 8,000 troops and donate $1 billion to a United Nations ''peace and development fund.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of the five permanent members of the Security Council, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has deployed the most troops in peacekeeping operations, including to conflict zones like South Sudan, where two Chinese soldiers were killed on a mission in July. A United Nations report found that the Chinese soldiers had left their posts during fighting there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Mr. Guterres did not mention that episode during his visit, he said he wanted to make sure that United Nations peacekeepers were better trained and were respectful of human rights. The Chinese Defense Ministry rejected reports that the soldiers had failed to protect aid workers who were raped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Guterres praised </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during his visit, but he also made some remarks that could be interpreted as a polite reminder about human rights. With Foreign Minister Wang Yi at his side on Monday, Mr. Guterres called for ''an effective combination in human rights, of civil and political rights and the economic and social rights in a balanced way.'' He did not refer explicitly to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but the point was clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> human rights issues touches on the agency Mr. Guterres has run since 2005, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. A United Nations commission criticized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2014 for forcibly returning tens of thousands of North Koreans who had crossed the border into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over two decades. It said a vast majority had been subjected to inhumane treatment -- including imprisonment, execution and torture -- after being returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch, said the Chinese authorities continued to intercept North Koreans who cross the border, in hopes of going south to Laos or Thailand and beyond. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> automatically classifies North Koreans crossing the border as economic migrants, not refugees fleeing persecution, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What is more, he said, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bans the refugee agency from sending its representatives to the border to interview North Koreans and to make their own determinations about their status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In short, U.N.H.C.R. has been told to stay away from the North Koreans,'' in violation of the United Nations convention on refugees, which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has signed, Mr. Robertson said.</SPAN></P>
