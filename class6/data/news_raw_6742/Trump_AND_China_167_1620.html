<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was building casinos in Atlantic City in the 1990s, he spoke of his dream of bringing jobs and development to the hard-luck community. In the end, after all the bankruptcies, layoffs and stiffed contractors, it was Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who walked away with tens of millions of dollars in management fees and huge tax deductions that may have helped him avoid paying personal income taxes for nearly two decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> announced the founding of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University in 2005, he described it as a way to share his real estate secrets with ordinary investors. ''If I had a choice of making lots of money or imparting lots of knowledge,'' he said, ''I think I'd be as happy to impart knowledge as to make money.'' In the end, after the university was shut down amid investigations and allegations of fraud, it was Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who again walked away with millions in fees. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Today Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is making his most selfless pledge of all, promising that if elected president he will walk away from his beloved business empire so he can devote himself entirely to the American people. ''If I become president, I couldn't care less about my company,'' he said at one debate. ''It's peanuts.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With the presidential campaign in the homestretch, Hillary Clinton is now taking dead aim at Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> professed altruistic purpose. She and her supporters are suggesting that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> regards the White House as one more moneymaking venture, the most lucrative opportunity of all to advance his family fortune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Imagine having a president who owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and other foreign entities that he doesn't tell us about,'' Mrs. Clinton said at a rally in Pittsburgh on Friday. ''Ask yourself: So if he's sitting across the table negotiating with people from those countries, is he going to put his own financial interests ahead of America's interests?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same rally, one of Mrs. Clinton's supporters, Mark Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, put it even more bluntly: ''There's going to come a time, if Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, God help us, was president, where a Putin or an Assad would say to him, 'Donald, if you do this, I'll give you $20 billion,''' Mr. Cuban said, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Do you think he's going to do what's right for the country? Or do you think he is going to take the money?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For more than a year now, reporters from The New York Times have been scouring Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business record, exploring the cycles of boom and bust, the spectacular reinventions, the shady business partners, the audacious tax avoidance maneuvers and the persistent deceptions that have been the leitmotif of his five decades of deal making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That review reveals plenty of reasons to be skeptical of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> oft-stated promise to direct every ounce of his business acumen and negotiating prowess in service of the American people. But the same review also reveals patterns of behavior and qualities of leadership that could indeed help Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fulfill his now-familiar sales pitch to voters: ''If we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, for example, has won millions of supporters by promising to renegotiate, abrogate or ignore any number of written commitments made by past American presidents, like trade deals, climate change pacts, even the Geneva Conventions. If there is one recurring theme in the litigation spawned by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business ventures, it is his brazen willingness to ignore the plain terms of contracts he finds inconvenient while relentlessly enforcing contract terms he finds useful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another recurring theme -- one that might come in handy given the inherent unpredictability of the White House -- is Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strategic flexibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When either his ambitions or circumstances shift, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has shown himself willing to make swift and dramatic course corrections in his businesses. From the moment Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took the reins of the real estate business his father founded, he was bent on reinvention, steering its focus away from mostly middle-class apartment projects in the other boroughs to big, splashy commercial developments in Manhattan. It is a formula Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has returned to time and again as he has cycled through different money making personas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His foray into reality television with ''The Apprentice'' was the biggest and most successful detour, a decision that came to look prescient with the collapse of the real estate market and recession in the late 2000s. Then, sensing opportunity in the public's economic anxiety, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remade himself yet again, this time as a sort of walking infomercial for get-rich-quick schemes. He peddled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University, a real estate sales seminar, and a multilevel vitamin marketing business called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Network as ways for average people to make money during difficult times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has pledged major spending to rebuild crumbling roads, bridges and airports, also has a track record, albeit with significant blemishes, of completing complex and politically fraught construction projects on time and under budget, most famously in the 1980s when, in a matter of months, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> refurbished Wollman Rink in Central Park, a project the City of New York had notoriously failed to complete after years of budget overruns and false starts. Likewise, last month when he attended the grand opening of his latest </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Hotel, just blocks from the White House, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> boasted that the hotel was completed under budget and ahead of schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In my whole life, I've gotten things done,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in an interview with The Times in May. ''Whether it's getting a city built on the West Side of Manhattan or getting zoning board approvals, my whole life has been finding a consensus.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Any assessment of how Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might use the White House to advance his financial interests is impaired by his unwillingness to release his tax returns, even in summary form, breaking with four decades of tradition followed by both Democratic and Republican candidates. His tax returns, for example, would reveal far more information about the nature of and financing behind his partnerships, which number in the hundreds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An investigation by The Times this summer into Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> maze of real estate holdings in the United States found that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> companies owed at least $650 million, or twice the amount that could be gleaned from the financial disclosure reports Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> submitted to run for the presidency. Separately, partnerships in which he has a significant interest have loans from the Bank of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Goldman Sachs, two powerful financial institutions his administration could expect to encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Further complicating matters is his plan to have his children continue running his business empire should he occupy the Oval Office. ''I would probably have my children run it with my executives, and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said at a debate in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The potential for conflicts of interest are all the more glaring given the prominent role his children have played in his political operation, both as surrogates and advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are not going to be involved in government,'' Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jr. said during an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. Mr. Stephanopoulos asked how conflicts could be avoided given that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was aware of all his business interests. ''We're not going to discuss those things,'' his son replied. ''It doesn't matter. Trust me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Regardless of how carefully the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trumps</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> police potential conflicts of interest, critics have been quick to note that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tax proposals alone would clearly benefit his business empire, not to mention the estate his children could expect to inherit on his death. Less clear is how Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> oversight of the Internal Revenue Service might impact an agency that has had Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or his partnerships under nearly constant audit for more than two decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then there are all the times Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has used his business empire as a backdrop during his campaign -- at times combining campaign statements with naked promotions for his properties, be it </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower, where he first announced his campaign, or his golf courses in Scotland, where he took his press pool on a hole-by-hole tour, or, most notoriously, when he summoned reporters to his new Washington hotel to show off its gleaming marble amenities while, after stoking doubts for years, he admitted in one terse sentence that ''President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has given no indication that as president he would curb his compulsion to constantly promote the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brand, which, according to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> own assessment of his total net worth, is now his single most valuable asset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In June, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> posted a message on Twitter that suggested how difficult this may be for him. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that he had ''instructed my execs'' to reopen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University if he is elected president. ''So much interest in it!''</SPAN></P>
