</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UBER AND DIDI CHUXING TEAM UP IN </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CHINA</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The battle for ride-sharing in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is over. Didi Chuxing plans to buy Uber </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, according to people with knowledge of the deal. After spending tens of millions of dollars every month fighting for market share, the two companies will combine into a new one worth about $35 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've learned that being successful is about listening to your head as well as following your heart,&quot; Travis Kalanick, Uber's chief executive, wrote in a blog post intended to announce the deal. &quot;Uber and Didi Chuxing are investing billions of dollars in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and both have yet to turn a profit there.&quot; Bloomberg, which earlier reported the deal, said that Uber had lost more than $2 billion in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors in Uber </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will receive a 20 percent stake in the new company and Didi will make a $1 billion investment in Uber Global.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ORACLE HAS A CLOUD PROBLEM Oracle has never really had a problem spending money, having shelled out for dozens of companies over the last 11 years. But as the new owner of NetSuite, it faces the challenge of integrating its new acquisition into its global network of data centers. And it will have to show that it can rein in competitors that have been stealing customers with fresher technology and cloud computing, as Oracle has taken its time shifting from its older and more expensive technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oracle figured it could distribute NetSuite's e-commerce and manufacturing software via its cloud, while using it to reach smaller companies that have so far been unable to afford Oracle's high-cost product. And that task falls to Thomas Kurian, the president of product development, who has been overseeing Oracle's reinvention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ON THE AGENDA The latest I.S.M. manufacturing report will be published at 10 a.m. Elizabeth Holmes, the founder and chief executive of Theranos, will speak at the annual meeting of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry in Philadelphia at 4:30 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YAHOO SALE LEAVES LITTLE CHOICE FOR SHAREHOLDERS The Yahoo sale is not the sale of a publicly traded company - it's the sale of the Yahoo subsidiary. The $4.8 billion will be paid to Yahoo, and its shareholders will not receive any money unless Yahoo pays it out in a dividend. They will be left holding shares in the remaining company. Although they have a vote on the sale, there will be no appraisal rights. So anyone who thinks the price is inadequate is out of luck, Steven Davidoff Solomon explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Verizon, for its part, will be agitating to make the most of its role in this deal. It has been trying to reinvent itself since before it bought AOL and Yahoo, seeking to shake its reputation as a big, boring telephone company to be considered a digital player. &quot;People act like Google and Facebook have already won. But nobody owns the future,&quot; said Tim Armstrong, AOL's chief executive, who will oversee the integration with Yahoo.</SPAN></P>
