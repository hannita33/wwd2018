<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HONG KONG -- For more than half a century, Asia has benefited from an American commitment to free trade and bilateral alliances in the region. But the election of Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> left both statesmen and citizens here asking whether that commitment -- and the prolonged era of peace and prosperity that has accompanied it -- might be coming to an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before he began his campaign for the presidency, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was known as a critic of policies that opened markets in the United States to lower-cost Asian goods and helped fuel the dizzying growth that transformed Japan, gave rise to the dynamic economies known as the four Asian tigers, and propelled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> emergence as a global power. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But during his campaign, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made a drumbeat of his criticism, accusing several nations here of currency manipulation and threatening a 45 percent tax on Chinese imports. He also added a geopolitical dimension by suggesting the United States might withdraw its security guarantees to Japan and South Korea unless they agreed to pay more of the cost of defending them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, the question in Asia is how much of that rhetoric Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will act on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, sent a conciliatory message of congratulations to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that made no mention of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promises to confront Beijing on trade and currency issues. ''Developing long-term healthy and stable Sino-U.S. relations is in the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries and is also the shared hope of the international community,'' Mr. Xi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Lu Kang, offered a cautious rebuttal of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> views on trade between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States, arguing that trade had ''benefited the people on both sides, including the American people, and has increased employment, rather than the opposite.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some economic advisers to the Chinese government were skeptical that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would follow through with drastic action that could prompt a trade war. After all, they said, American presidential candidates have been promising to get tough on Chinese trade policies for more than two decades and have invariably backed off after taking office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Nobody takes the electioneering that seriously,'' said Andrew Sheng, a former chairman of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission who advises the Chinese government on financial policy. ''People accept that the American consumers benefit so much from trade that it won't change that much.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yu Yongding, a prominent economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, also had doubts. ''All the things he said during the election were the talk of an amateur -- I don't think he was in earnest,'' he said. ''After he becomes president, there'll be advisers at his side to explain to him what the exchange rate is, what capital flows are, what macroeconomic policy is.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But if there was disbelief that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would follow through on his trade threats, there was also unease that his election could portend a retreat by the United States from the region that could embolden </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, force Japan and South Korea to consider alternatives to the American nuclear umbrella and unleash long-suppressed tensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Maybe he will decrease the commitment to Pacific security issues,'' said Shin Kawashima, a professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo. ''But if he carries out such a policy, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be much more authoritative and aggressive in the Pacific. And then most of the alliance countries and security experts in Washington will be against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policies. It is a little difficult for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to just change all the old policies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Tokyo, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe congratulated Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and sought to remind him of Washington's special relationship with his nation. ''Japan and the United States are unwavering allies tied firmly with the bond of universal values such as freedom, democracy, basic human rights, and the rule of law,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And some in Japan expressed hope that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might prove milder in office than he was on the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Once he becomes the president, he will change, I think,'' said Katsuhito Momii, 73, chairman of NHK, the public broadcasting service. ''Reagan became a great president, so no matter what he said before the election, I think he will change.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some analysts said they feared that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> America First vision would embolden Japan's own right-wing nationalists, who push a revisionist history that denies the Japanese military committed atrocities during World War II. Jiro Yamaguchi, a professor of political science at Hosei University in Tokyo, said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and South Korea, victims of Japan's wartime aggression, would object to any resurgence of Japan's right wing and that this would increase tensions in East Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In South Korea, where President Park Geun-hye has been battling a corruption scandal, there appeared to be concern that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election might be misinterpreted by the North, which has been racing to develop nuclear weapons and had welcomed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> threat to withdraw American troops from the South unless it paid more for their presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''North Korea should not misjudge the solidity of our alliance with the United States and our joint ability to respond'' to its provocations, a government spokesman, Jeong Joon-hee, warned, adding that the South remained unshakable in its belief that it should maintain a strong military alliance with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moon Jae-in, an opposition leader and leading contender for the presidency in the election next year, also reaffirmed his commitment to the alliance ''no matter who becomes president there.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute in Seongnam, said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory could ''open the way for South Korea to go nuclear'' with Washington's consent to protect itself from the North.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The prospect of a nuclear arms race in Asia would certainly unsettle </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But analysts said that was one of many troubling issues that the Communist government could be forced to confront under a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said that many in the foreign policy establishment had been wary of Hillary Clinton and believed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be less likely to oppose President Xi's increasingly assertive territorial claims in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''A weakened and disorganized West like this will surely bring many more additional strategic opportunities for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which would be even less prudent in its foreign policy, as it has been since 2013,'' Mr. Shi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he added that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> approach to trade could cause problems for Mr. Xi when he is already struggling with an economic slowdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''These changes will make it more difficult for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economy,'' he said, ''in a time when it is already facing difficulties at home.''</SPAN></P>
