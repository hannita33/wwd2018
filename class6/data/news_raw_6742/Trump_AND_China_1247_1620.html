</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the economic benefits and drawbacks of global trade?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who are the winners and losers in this story of economic change?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the questions students will consider as they learn why trade became such an important issue in the 2016 election. As part of the lesson, they will also consider the implications of President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> related campaign promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Background</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Global trade was one of the core issues Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> returned to over and over during his 2016 presidential campaign. In the end, the states that effectively handed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> his Election Day victory were the Rust Belt states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin - states that were predicted to vote for Hillary Clinton, yet have been hard-hit by an exodus of well-paying manufacturing jobs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why has Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> message that &quot;our politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization - moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas&quot; resonated with so many voters? Why has he condemned the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) &quot;as the worst trade deal in history&quot; and declared that &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> entrance into the World Trade Organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in history&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lesson begins by having students investigate where their possessions are manufactured; then they use a Times video and article to help them better understand the complex consequences of increased trade. Further down, we offer opportunities for debate and argument writing, analyzing the effects of global trade abroad, and doing additional research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_________</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warm Up: What Countries Make the Products We Buy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This activity can be started for homework the night before or completed entirely during class:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students, look at the labels on your clothing, sneakers, electronics or anything else you own. Choose five items and find out where they're made. List the countries on the board, or share in small groups. What trends do you notice across the class or in your groups? What countries are making the things that Americans buy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, using a computer or their phones, students should find out the minimum wage (Wikipedia) and the G.D.P.per capita (World Bank) of three or more countries that produced the highest number of goods for the class or their small group. They should find the same information for the United States, assuming the U.S. is not included in their list already. Be sure students understand what these economic terms mean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After they have gathered this data, students should consider any trends they notice about the countries that produce most of the goods they and their classmates identified. How do wages and economic activity in these countries compare to the same categories for the United States?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of this information can be recorded using this handout (PDF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_________</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video: &quot;The iPhone Economy&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To better understand how global trade works and the consequences of it, students should watch this 2012 Times video. Here are questions for writing and discussion:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. How is the iPhone a product of global trade?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. How has the U.S. economy lost some higher-wage jobs as well as a &quot;job multiplier&quot; as manufacturing has moved abroad?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. How does comparing the United States' largest employers today with those in 1960 tell a story about how the American economy has changed over the past 50 years? How does Apple fit into this story?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. What groups are the winners and losers in the American economy today?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. According to the video, why are our economic problems so hard to solve?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_________</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Article to Read, Annotate and Discuss: &quot;More Wealth, More Jobs, but Not for Everyone: What Fuels the Backlash on Trade&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next, students should read and annotate Peter S. Goodman's in-depth article, &quot;More Wealth, More Jobs, but Not for Everyone: What Fuels the Backlash on Trade.&quot; (Available here in PDF.) Here's an excerpt from the article, so you can quickly assess its reading level and get to the heart of its argument:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For generations, libraries full of economics textbooks have rightly promised that global trade expands national wealth by lowering the price of goods, lifting wages and amplifying growth. The powers that emerged victorious from World War II championed globalization as the antidote to future conflicts. In Asia, Europe and North America, governments of every ideological persuasion have focused on trade as their guiding economic force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But trade comes with no assurances that the spoils will be shared equitably. Across much of the industrialized world, an outsize share of the winnings have been harvested by people with advanced degrees, stock options and the need for accountants. Ordinary laborers have borne the costs and suffered from joblessness and deepening economic anxiety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These costs have proved overwhelming in communities that depend on industry for sustenance, vastly exceeding what economists anticipated. Policy makers under the thrall of neoliberal economic philosophy put stock in the notion that markets could be trusted to bolster social welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In doing so, they failed to plan for the trauma that has accompanied the benefits of trade. When millions of workers lost paychecks to foreign competition, they lacked government supports to cushion the blow. As a result, seething anger is upending politics in Europe and North America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Below are questions for writing and discussion:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The article states, &quot;For generations, libraries full of economics textbooks have rightly promised that global trade expands national wealth by lowering the price of goods, lifting wages and amplifying growth.&quot; What went wrong? Why was global trade such an important issue in the 2016 election for many voters?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The article states, &quot;Successive administrations in the United States, led by Democrats and Republicans alike, have embraced liberalized trade as a central component of the nation's foreign policy. Yet only 19 percent of American voters said trade with other countries created more jobs in the United States, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released in July.&quot; Why is there a disconnect between government trade policy by both Democrats and Republicans and what American voters think?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The consequences of increasing global trade for American workers and the American economy are complex. Who are the winners? Who are the losers? And, how are some groups both winners and losers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The article states, &quot;American factories produced more goods last year than ever, by many indications. Yet they did so while employing about 12.3 million workers - roughly the same number as in 2009, when production was roughly three-fourths what it is today.&quot; How can this be - that American factories are producing more than ever before, but while employing fewer workers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. What is Nafta? What is the W.T.O.? Explain how each has affected American workers and the American economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Douglas A. Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College, stated, &quot;We have a public policy toward trade. We don't have a public policy on automation.&quot; What point is he making, and why is it relevant to this discussion?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. What kind of safety net do government programs provide for workers displaced by increased global trade? How does this safety net fall short in the United States?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_________</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activity: Debate, Discussion or Argument Writing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is increasing global trade a force for positive or negative change? Or both? And, should the United States pursue more free trade agreements or trade protectionism as the best solution to the negative consequences of globalization?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After watching the video and reading the article, students have enough information to support both sides in an evidence-based discussion, debate or argument-writing piece. They can also suggest policy proposals for supporting workers or businesses hurt by the changing economy. For example, is there anything government policy can do to raise wages and working conditions for service workers now that many manufacturing jobs have disappeared?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you want students to have more information to bolster their arguments, here are additional resources from The Times and elsewhere:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_________</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going Further</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Rise of Automation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changes to the economy brought on by global trade are happening at the same time as an increase in automated manufacturing. Peter S. Goodman writes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the while, automation has grown in sophistication and reach. From 2000 to 2010, the United States lost some 5.6 million manufacturing jobs, by the government's calculation. Only 13 percent of those job losses can be explained by trade, according to an analysis by the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University in Indiana. The rest were casualties of automation or the result of tweaks to factory operations that enabled more production with less labor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students can watch the video above about how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is rushing to develop and deploy a wide variety of robots for use in thousands of factories. And, they can read the article &quot;As Robots Grow Smarter, American Workers Struggle to Keep Up.&quot; Does automation present a bigger threat to American jobs than foreign competition? Should we try to slow down advances in robots and artificial intelligence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or, should we think outside the box, such as with this proposal to give every adult an automatic paycheck - a plan known as &quot;universal basic income?&quot; Farhad Manjoo writes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than a job-killing catastrophe, tech supporters of U.B.I. consider machine intelligence to be something like a natural bounty for society: The country has struck oil, and now it can hand out checks to each of its citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Women Trying to Join the Workforce in India</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ellen Barry's article &quot;In India, a Small Band of Women Risk It All for a Chance to Work&quot; tells the story of a group of women in rural India who fought the established patriarchal social order for a chance to work in nearby factories where they could earn money and independence. What does globalization look like for these women? How does it present both opportunities and risks?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For students who want to explore this issue further, Ms. Barry has another related article, &quot;Young Rural Women in India Chase Big-City Dreams.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Raising - or Lowering - Labor Standards?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the complaints against free trade agreements is that workers overseas are not guaranteed the same protections as American workers. In &quot;Retailers Like H&amp;M and Walmart Fall Short of Pledges to Overseas Workers,&quot; Rachel Abrams writes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After more than 1,100 deaths exposed dangerous labor conditions in Bangladesh in 2013, brands like H&amp;M, Walmart and Gap were among the most powerful companies that pledged to improve the safety of some of the country's poorest workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But human rights groups say that three years later, those promises are still unfulfilled, and that safety, labor and other issues persist in Bangladesh and other countries where global retailers benefit from an inexpensive work force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are trade agreements unfair when they help to move jobs from countries with higher labor standards and stricter environmental laws to countries without the same level of safeguarding? Or, will the transition these countries make to a more modern economy naturally raise labor standards abroad</SPAN></P>
