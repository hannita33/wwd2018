<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sharply changed the federal government's approach to the environment on Tuesday as he cleared the way for two major oil pipelines that had been blocked, and set in motion a plan to curb regulations that slow other building projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his latest moves to dismantle the legacy of his predecessor, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> resurrected the Keystone XL pipeline that had stirred years of debate, and expedited another pipeline in the Dakotas that had become a major flash point for Native Americans. He also signed a directive ordering an end to protracted environmental reviews. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I am, to a large extent, an environmentalist, I believe in it,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said during a meeting with auto industry executives. ''But it's out of control, and we're going to make it a very short process. And we're going to either give you your permits, or we're not going to give you your permits. But you're going to know very quickly. And generally speaking, we're going to be giving you your permits.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The decisions expanded an effort to unravel much of the policy structure left by former President Barack Obama, who made fighting climate change a central priority. Just a day earlier, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> formally abandoned the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an ambitious 12-nation trade pact negotiated by Mr. Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his opening days in office, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has also modified or reversed Mr. Obama's policies on health care, abortion and housing while ordering a freeze of any pending regulations left behind by the former administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The pipelines were more about symbol than substance but generated enormous passion on both sides of the debate. Mr. Obama rejected the proposed Keystone pipeline in 2015, arguing that it would undercut American leadership in curbing the reliance on carbon energy. The Army sidetracked the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota last month in the waning days of the Obama administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Environmental activists quickly denounced Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decisions. ''Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been in office for four days, and he's already proving to be the dangerous threat to our climate we feared he would be,'' said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made clear on the campaign trail that he saw Mr. Obama's environmental policies as a threat to the economy and dismissed climate change as a hoax perpetrated by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Myron Ebell, a climate change denier who headed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Environmental Protection Agency transition team, has drafted a 50-page blueprint for how he could eliminate Mr. Obama's climate change policies. ''It is designed to implement all of the president's campaign trail promises -- every single one,'' Mr. Ebell said this week in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> biggest target may be emission rules that would force the closing of hundreds of coal-fired power plants meant to be replaced by wind and solar power. But they are caught up in court battles that could run for months or years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By contrast, he could more quickly soften Mr. Obama's rules requiring tougher vehicle emission standards. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> met on Tuesday with executives of major American automakers, who complained that before leaving office, Mr. Obama finalized an ambitious E.P.A. rule requiring that vehicles average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2026. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he would help with burdensome regulations, but offered no specifics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could lift a moratorium instituted last year by Mr. Obama on new coal mining leases on public lands. As soon as next month, the Republican-led Congress may pass legislation undoing Mr. Obama's regulations on the practice of mountaintop-removal coal mining and on leaks of planet-warming methane emissions from oil and gas drilling rigs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the meantime, the Keystone and Dakota pipelines provided Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with visible ways to demonstrate action. As proposed by TransCanada, an Alberta firm, Keystone would carry 800,000 barrels a day from the Canadian oil sands to the Gulf Coast. Republicans and some Democrats said that it would create jobs and expand energy resources, while environmentalists said it would encourage a form of oil extraction that produces more gases that warm the planet than normal petroleum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Studies showed that the pipeline would not have a momentous effect on jobs or the environment, but both sides made it into a symbolic test case. The State Department estimated that Keystone would support 42,000 temporary jobs for two years -- about 3,900 of them in construction and the rest through indirect support, like food service -- but only 35 permanent jobs. Similarly, the government concluded that Keystone's carbon emissions would equal less than 1 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Keystone has never been a significant issue from an environmental point of view in substance, only in symbol,'' said David L. Goldwyn, an energy market analyst and a former head of the State Department's energy bureau in the Obama administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it was a symbol Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> found important enough to seize on early in his presidency. He signed an executive memorandum inviting TransCanada ''to promptly resubmit its application to the Department of State for a presidential permit'' for the pipeline, although the document did not guarantee approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president told reporters he would ''renegotiate some of the terms'' -- including possibly an insistence that the pipeline be built with American steel -- but left little doubt that he wanted it approved. ''We'll see if we can get that pipeline built,'' he said. ''A lot of jobs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a statement, TransCanada accepted his invitation to seek permission again. ''We are currently preparing the application and intend to do so,'' the company said, vowing that it would create jobs and still protect waterways and other sensitive resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota became the focus of protests when the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe objected to its construction less than a mile from its reservation. The tribe and its allies won victory last month when the Army Corps of Engineers announced that it would look for alternative routes for the $3.7 billion pipeline instead of allowing it to be drilled under a dammed section of the Missouri River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> signed an executive memorandum directing the Army ''to review and approve in an expedited manner'' the pipeline, ''to the extent permitted by law and as warranted.'' In his session with reporters, he added, ''Again, subject to terms and conditions to be negotiated by us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> owned stock in Energy Transfer Partners, the company that is building the Dakota Access pipeline, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission. Last month, a spokesman for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he sold all of his stock in June, but there is no way of verifying that sale, and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not provided documentation of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Critics vowed to keep resisting the projects. Jan Hasselman, a lawyer for Earthjustice, an environmental law group representing the tribe, said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was discarding the findings of a review. ''They're just ignoring the problems that the government has already found,'' he said, ''and that is the kind of thing that courts need to review very closely.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Canada, the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau welcomed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision. ''We have been supportive of this since the day we were sworn into government,'' Jim Carr, the natural resources minister, told reporters. Mr. Carr said the American reversal will lead ''to a deepening of the relationship across the border.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to the Keystone and Dakota directives, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> signed three others intended to ease the way for businesses and to promote American manufacturing. One instructed the Commerce Department to develop a plan to ensure that future pipelines built in the United States be constructed of American-made materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another was aimed at streamlining what he called ''the incredibly cumbersome, long, horrible permitting process and reducing regulatory burdens for domestic manufacturing.'' The last directive was intended to expedite environmental reviews for ''high-priority infrastructure projects'' like highways and bridges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some news reports on Tuesday said that the E.P.A. and other departments had issued orders forbidding employees from issuing news releases or posting on social media. But longtime officials in multiple agencies said the guidance was similar to that of when Mr. Obama took office eight years ago.</SPAN></P>
