</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the United States, prominent Republicans and the Clinton campaign are calling for investigations into intelligence findings that Russian cyberattacks supported Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidential bid, an assessment he has dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a guide to separating fact from speculation about Russia's interference.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has picked Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, for secretary of state. But the oilman has a conflict of interest: billions of dollars in company deals that can go forward only if the U.S. lifts sanctions against Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Syria, Aleppo is falling. The forces of President Bashar al-Assad are within days, if not hours, of capturing the last corners of the country's largest city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seizure would be a turning point in the civil war, cementing government rule in all major cities and forcing the opposition to reckon with whether the armed rebellion has failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Italy, the cabinet of Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni was sworn in. If Parliament endorses the largely unchanged group of ministers, Mr. Gentiloni will represent the country at European Council talks scheduled for Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawmakers from the Five Star Movement, a populist, anti-establishment party, are expected to boycott the vote. The party's successes are strained by fears of a shift toward centralized authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The French police arrested 11 people suspected of assisting the terrorist attack on Bastille Day in Nice last year, which left 86 people dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today Parliament will debate a fifth extension of the state of emergency, which was declared after the attacks in Paris in November 2015, until the day after Bastille Day in 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bill Gates, along with other global business leaders, started a fund that will invest more than $1 billion in energy research to reduce the causes of climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Gates said investors were in it for the long haul. &quot;Once you can make cheap electricity reliably,&quot; he said, &quot;there's a huge market for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And investors who control more than $5 trillion in assets have agreed to drop some or all of their fossil fuel stocks. The divestment movement has doubled in size in 15 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turkey's economy unexpectedly shrank in the third quarter in its first contraction since 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Monetary Fund said it opposed further austerity in Greece, putting it in disagreement with some eurozone countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UniCredit, Italy's largest bank, aims to raise 13 billion euros in stocks and cut costs. The lender plans to cut 14,000 jobs by 2019.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About a third of French companies discriminate against job applicants with Arab-sounding names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, has been picked as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> top economic adviser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women who lived Mosul, Iraq, under the Islamic State's two-year occupation described the tyranny of an extreme dress code - even their eyes had to be covered - enforced with a whip. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a tweet, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> assailed cost overruns for the Lockheed Martin-built F-35 fighter jet. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, told lawmakers that a longer transition period for the country's departure from the European Union is gaining support. [Bloomberg]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A court in Italy could issue its verdict today over a shipwreck in the Mediterranean in 2015, which led to more than 800 deaths. [Euronews]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Armed thieves are on the run in France after stealing more than 150 pounds of gold in a freeway heist. [BBC]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pep Guardiola, the Spanish former soccer player who now manages Manchester City, is to many the epitome of Continental sophistication, but his principles border on heretical. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our Daily 360 video takes you to the Niger-Nigeria border, where hundreds of thousands of people face food scarcity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our editors look at how Madonna's recent speech about sexism put Hillary Clinton's candidacy in fresh perspective. &quot;Trailblazing is a solitary game,&quot; one says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;La La Land&quot; took seven Golden Globe nominations. Here's the complete list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Smokers in Turkey are clinging to their cigarettes and water pipes, resisting strong government efforts to curb the habit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A recent study suggests that a vigorous workout may do little to counter the negative effects of prolonged sitting, while walking frequently, in addition to exercising, does seem to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And take a look at this workout gear. It's fashionable enough for the runway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Basketball celebrates its 125th birthday this month. Its inventor, Dr. James Naismith, aimed to keep athletes vigorous through the winter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He might be surprised at the game's popularity worldwide. Especially in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where at least 300 million people play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YMCA missionaries introduced the new game in Tianjin in 1895 and, using a Chinese translation of Naismith's rule book, spread it widely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yao Ming lifted basketball's profile in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after becoming the top pick in the 2002 N.B.A. draft, but earlier factors helped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the Communist Party embraced it. Games maintained soldiers' morale during the Long March, when Mao Zedong led the Red Army on a retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while Mao declared war against almost all Western imports during the Cultural Revolution, &quot;he never wavered in support of basketball,&quot; The Atlantic reported in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1979, a few years after President Nixon's historic visit, the N.B.A.'s Washington Bullets (now Wizards) visited to play </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> national team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everywhere you went and there was open space, you saw a basketball hoop,&quot; the Washington coach said. &quot;It was just a matter of time before they developed it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the league later opened offices there, and has succeeded where companies like Google and Facebook have struggled.</SPAN></P>
