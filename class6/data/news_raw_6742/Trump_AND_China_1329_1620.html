</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TESLA'S NEW GRAND PLAN The chief of Tesla, Elon Musk, has published a new &quot;master plan,&quot; which involves installing a solar panel system into cars, building heavier vehicles and introducing a ride-hailing business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manifesto was partly a way for him to explain why he wanted to integrate Tesla and SolarCity. In a blog post, Mr. Musk sought to place his intentions for Tesla and SolarCity within the context of bigger ideas. &quot;That they are separate at all, despite similar origins and pursuit of the same overarching goal of sustainable energy, is largely an accident of history,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also outlined plans to build semi trucks and buses, as well as pursuing self-driving technology, which would allow people to use their cars for ride-sharing. He said that some sort of heavy-duty truck and bus would be &quot;ready for unveiling next year,&quot; adding that a Tesla Semi would &quot;deliver a substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transport.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Musk acknowledged the scale of his ambitions: &quot;Starting a car company is idiotic and an electric car company is idiocy squared.&quot; Analysts followed suit. &quot;As is typical, Elon Musk has laid out a grandiose plan for the future with no timeframes and few specifics, and no mention of how and when Tesla will be profitable,&quot; Michelle Krebs, an analyst for Autotrader.com, wrote in an email to Bloomberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HEDGE FUNDS ACCUSE PUERTO RICO'S GOVERNOR OF MONEY GRAB The fight over Puerto Rico's funds continues even as the island awaits the installation of a federal oversight board to monitor its spending under a new debt restructuring law. A built-in delay means that the federal board will not be in place for at least two months, and a group of hedge funds has sued Gov. Alejandro Garc&iacute;a Padilla for violating the law in the meantime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The funds said that Mr. Garc&iacute;a Padilla had been grabbing hundreds of millions of public dollars to spend on &quot;purposes that apparently enjoy political favor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government outlays referred to in the lawsuit include $800 million that went to Puerto Rico's pension system for public employees and $250 million apparently used to prop up the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico. The case is likely to harden public opinion in Puerto Rico, where the oversight board is regarded as an unacceptable display of Yankee imperialism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor's chief of staff, Grace Santana, said that more lawsuits were expected and that the administration would fight them aggressively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Williams Walsh reports on the details of the case here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ON THE AGENDA The National Association of Realtors will publish data on sales of existing homes during June at 10 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BEER MEGA-MERGER CLOSER TO COMPLETION The Justice Department has cleared the way for the deal between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller, the biggest beer merger in history. But antitrust approval has come with some conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anheuser had to agree not to buy a distributor that would push more than 10 percent of its overall sales volume through wholly owned distributors and not to cut ties with wholesalers as part of the transaction. The company also promised not to make moves that would encourage distributors to favor Anheuser or SABMiller brands over competing ones. Anheuser also agreed to sell brands like Grolsch, Peroni and Meantime to Asahi Group Holdings of Japan for about $2.9 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As well as the United States, 21 jurisdictions including Europe, South Korea and South Africa have given the deal their regulatory blessing. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> regulators are expected to approve the deal. Anheuser has already agreed to sell SABMiller's 49 percent stake in Snow, the most popular beer in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
