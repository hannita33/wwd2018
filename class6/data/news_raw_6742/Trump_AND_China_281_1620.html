</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I cannot verify its provenance, the following appears to be my Sunday column from Nov. 8, 2020, which slipped through a small rift in the space-time continuum while I was writing a panicked, ''It's the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apocalypse!'' column this week. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I SHOULD have seen it coming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Throughout the 2016 election -- remember those crazy times? -- I tried to draw a distinction between Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strategy and the man himself. In the primaries I thought that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pitch to working-class voters, his breaks with Republican orthodoxy on economic and foreign policy, were often politically brilliant ... but that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> himself was too much of a loose cannon to actually win the party's nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When that assumption was proved wrong, I thought that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> general-election strategy of going hard after Rust Belt votes had the potential to split the Obama coalition ... but that his obvious sexism and white-identity appeals would alienate women and drive minority turnout too high for him to win.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Well, that was wrong, too. Which left me with my assumptions about a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration: that in theory an ideologically-flexible president promising a national-interest-first foreign policy could be remarkably popular, but that in practice </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would give us economic weakness, global instability, and domestic upheaval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet here we are four years later, watching </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bask in the glow of an easy re-election over the Warren-Booker Democratic ticket. And given how successfully he defied expectations all through 2016, the path he's taken to this point probably shouldn't have come as such a surprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  First, there was no economic slump. The jitters that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ascent induced were swamped by the market's eagerness for fiscal stimulus -- a policy course that (ironically enough) prominent liberal pundits had urged for years, and that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> era swiftly provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Keynesianism was mostly defense spending and tax cuts, but it included a huge infrastructure push -- soon nicknamed ''TrumpWorks'' -- that doubled as a jobs program for his core constituency, blue-collar men. The assumption that the economy had hit full employment in the later Obama years proved to be an artifact of work-force dropouts and increasing illegal immigration. With TrumpWorks hiring, a wall rising (albeit haphazardly) on the southern border and millennials' entry into the housing market sparking a sudden construction boom, both wages and the work-force participation rate began to sharply climb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also turned out to be good at bipartisan maneuvering. Well aware that Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell had held their noses to support him, he quickly promised Chuck Schumer major input on a few key domestic issues. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supply-side tax cuts passed on a party-line vote, but his infrastructure bill passed with a motley bipartisan coalition. So did a bill mixing child-care subsidies and child tax credits, which became more middle-class-friendly after Ivanka and Schumer hammered out the details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In return for letting those bills reach the floor, Paul Ryan was promised </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> backing for an omnibus health care bill replacing Obamacare and reforming Medicare at once. But as health care negotiations dragged on across 2017, it became clear that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was quietly encouraging a tacit right-left grass-roots alliance against benefit cuts of any sort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This came to a head in what was dubbed ''the Battle of Janesville,'' when Ryan found himself shouted down by a crowd of town hall seniors, some sporting ''Make America Great Again'' caps, as he tried to defend Medicare premium support. After that scene (which played over and over on Sean Hannity's nightly propaganda hour) Ryan's vision withered on the legislative vine -- leaving Obamacare to limp on, its subsidies officially repealed but ''temporarily'' extended every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other right-wing priorities have fared better, especially on energy and financial deregulation, and the Democrats have found some political footing attacking </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coziness with Wall Street. But overall he has afforded them fewer targets than they expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Somehow Kellyanne Conway, ''counselor to the president'' and all-purpose Svengali, has persuaded him to tiptoe around racial politics and simply ignore the constant left-wing protests, which has increased the protests' fury, but also their unpopularity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Meanwhile his obvious lack of interest in social conservatism has enabled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to effectively decentralize the culture wars. His Supreme Court appointments (Mike Lee to fill the Scalia seat, Ted Cruz to replace a retiring Clarence Thomas) have simply kept the court's Obama-era balance intact; Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer keep taking their vitamins and declining to retire. There have been no nationalizing flash points, no equivalent of Bush's marriage amendment push or Obama's mandates on religious institutions; whenever transgender rights come up, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> press secretary, Jeffrey Lord, murmurs ''it's a state issue'' and moves on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Finally, in foreign policy, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has delivered what he promised: A brutal realpolitik, built around d&eacute;tente with Russia and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (the promised trade war turned out to be mostly rhetoric) and a ruthless focus on counterterrorism. Crimea has been ceded to Russia and Ukraine left to fend for itself, U.S. rhetoric about democracy promotion has all but disappeared, and a concert of American-backed strongmen are grinding away at Islamists from North Africa to Iraq. Since the fall of Raqqa and the capture of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS has become a stateless terror group, claiming credit for a series of small-scale attacks but nothing at a 9/11 level, which has enabled </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to declare constantly that he has radical Islam ''on the run.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whether this boastfulness survives his second term is unclear. Terrorist recruitment has increased in regions affected by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> drone strikes; Putin, after a period of consolidation following the easing of sanctions, is working to destabilize Eastern Europe once more, and Xi Jinping is making forays in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> near-abroad. The collapse of the Iranian nuclear deal has Tehran marching toward a bomb; Israel and Saudi Arabia are lobbying </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to strike Iran, but Putin may have his ear instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the home front, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has total control of the G.O.P. (Ryan having slipped into retirement) but no real program left: He's unwilling to cut spending and his signal second-term initiative, a Mars Shot headed by Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, lacks an obvious political constituency. Democrats charge that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> boom is unsustainable, and soaring deficits and creeping inflation suggest they might be vindicated. White House attempts to strong-arm the press into ignoring the rampant corruption of TrumpWorks have been ugly without being particularly successful. The public still has a low opinion of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ethics; they've just been willing to forgive a lot because of a rising G.D.P.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So his second term could still look like the disaster that I and so many others feared would arrive in his first one. But here in the fall of 2020, halfway through the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> era, we also need to reckon with reality: By charting the same distinctive ideological course he followed in his strange political ascent, President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign-trail boast -- ''folks, I made America great again'' -- is one that a majority of Americans understandably believe.</SPAN></P>
