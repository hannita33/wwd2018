<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;-&nbsp; President-elect: ''I didn't do anything to divide'' the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; The governor of Iowa is the president-elect's choice for ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Wrestling impresario tapped for Small Business Administration</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Linda McMahon, the former chief executive officer of World Wrestling Entertainment, was selected on Wednesday by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to head the Small Business Administration, adding another billionaire to the president-elect's affluent stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Linda has a tremendous background and is widely recognized as one of the country's top female executives advising businesses around the globe. She helped grow W.W.E. from a modest 13-person operation to a publicly traded global enterprise with more than 800 employees in offices worldwide,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. McMahon, a failed Senate candidate from Connecticut, was with her husband Vince one of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> biggest campaign donors. She contributed $6 million to a ''super PAC'' supporting Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in August and September, according to federal election filings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And, of course, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has shown a great facility for professional wrestling, so the choice makes sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  [Video: Watch Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Take Down WWE's Vince McMahon Back in 2007 Watch on YouTube.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President-elect's Time interview: Not a divider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview with Time for its person of the year issue, and a follow-up with NBC's ''Today'' show, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> talked tough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; He insisted he has nothing to do with the ''divided states of America'' that Time says he will lead. ''When you say divided states of America, I didn't divide them,'' he told NBC. ''I'm not president yet, so I didn't do anything to divide.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; He declined to criticize Rodrigo R. Duterte, president of the Philippines, who is leading a bloody campaign in the streets of Manila against drugs, or even to push back on comparisons between Mr. Duterte and the president-elect's promised crackdown on criminal illegal immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Well, hey, look, this is bad stuff,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told Time. ''They slice them up, they carve their initials in the girl's forehead, O.K.? What are we supposed to do? Be nice about it?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; He rejected United States intelligence conclusions that Russia was behind hacks at the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign that boosted his campaign. ''I don't believe it. I don't believe they interfered,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said of the Russians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; And he again said he would press Boeing on an Air Force One upgrade, though his Twitter order to ''cancel'' the project seems to have faded. ''I'm going to negotiate prices, and the planes are too expensive, and we're going to get the prices down.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Keith Ellison says he'll quit the House if elected Democratic chair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Representative Keith Ellison said Wednesday he would resign his House seat if he is elected chair of the Democratic National Committee, sweeping away an impediment to his bid for the party post while denying his critics a handy argument against his controversial candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Whoever wins the D.N.C. chair race faces a lot of work, travel, planning and resource raising. I will be 'all-in' to meet the challenge,''' Mr. Ellison said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A range of prominent Democrats have expressed unease about installing a part-time chairman at the D.N.C. at a time when the party is shut out of power in Washington. But that argument against Mr. Ellison has also served as a stand-in for broader, and more delicate, concerns about the liberal Minnesotan. Some Jewish Democrats are nervous about his past ties to the Nation of Islam and comments about Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Haim Saban, one of the party's biggest donors, said Mr. Ellison would be ''a disaster'' for Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The battle for Air Force One: Day 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sounded more conciliatory toward Boeing on Wednesday after its chief executive promised to help control the cost of a proposed new Air Force One plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had tweeted ''Cancel Order!'' on Tuesday after writing that it could cost over $4 billion to build two of the jets with high-tech communications and security by the mid-2020s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in a telephone interview with the Today Show, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that he had since talked to the Boeing executive, Dennis Muilenburg, saying he was a ''terrific guy, and we're going to work it out.'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he would negotiate lower prices or ''we're not going to order them, we'll stay with what we have.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he had tweeted about the project after hearing the cost estimates. He said he had not seen a Chicago Tribune article citing Mr. Muilenburg's concerns about his trade policies that was posted shortly before his tweet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> picks trade advocate to be ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For all his talk of punishing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has chosen a conciliator with a personal relationship with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president to be his ambassador in Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An Iowa governor might seem an unlikely choice for one of the more sensitive diplomatic posts, but Gov. Terry Branstad has ties with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that go back decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Branstad, whose selection was first reported by Bloomberg News and confirmed on condition of anonymity on Wednesday by two people with direct knowledge, is close to President Xi Jinping, whom he has known for more than three decades. They met in 1985, when Mr. Branstad was serving his first term as governor of Iowa and Mr. Xi was a 31-year-old rural official in Hebei Province, studying modern American agriculture, including hog and corn farming in Iowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Branstad has courted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as governor, promoting his state's farm goods. As ambassador, he would be tasked with managing a complex relationship that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has already indicated he is willing to shake up. The president-elect's call with Taiwan's president last week prompted criticism from Beijing, which considers it a breakaway province, and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> responded with posts on Twitter attacking </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for its trade practices and provocative moves in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is scheduled to travel to Des Moines on Thursday for a rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Saving the Dreamers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Facing intense pressure over the so-called ''Dreamers,'' young people brought to the United States by their undocumented parents and allowed to stay under President Obama, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appears to be softening his stance on whether to deport the more than 700,000 of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're going work something out that's going to make people happy and proud,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told Time. ''They got brought here at a very young age, they've worked here, they've gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they're in never-never land because they don't know what's going to happen.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not go into specifics or say he would reverse his promise to reverse Mr. Obama's executive actions, including the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which protected young undocumented immigrants from deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Dreamers are likely to present Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with the first major domestic policy test of administration, as many of his campaign promises clash with more moderate Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill who have implored Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not to deny these young adults protective status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> top advisers and potential cabinet members, including his nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, however, oppose Mr. Obama's executive action on immigration and other measures that would allow undocumented immigrants to stay in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago made the case to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> personally on Wednesday. Emerging into the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower lobby, Mr. Emanuel said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I delivered to the president-elect, his senior adviser and his chief of staff a letter signed by 14 mayors put together from across the country about DACA students, that they were working hard toward the American dream, and that all of us fundamentally believe that these are students, these are also people who want to join the armed forces, they gave their name, their address, their phone number, where they are, they're trying to achieve the American dream, it's no fault of their own their parents came here. They are something we should hold up and embrace.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> teaming with reality show titan for a really big show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a breakfast fund-raiser at Manhattan's Cipriani 42nd Street, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Wednesday gave a tantalizing hint at the inaugural festivities to come for a reality TV star-turned-president: The helicopter grand entrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president-elect said he was paid a visit a day earlier by Mark Burnett, the executive producer of ''The Apprentice,'' the reality show that helped make the president-elect a household name. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told the crowd that Mr. Burnett proposed reinventing the inauguration with a helicopter taking off from New York City, according to an attendee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Burnett, who is known for producing shows like ''Survivor,'' ''The Voice'' and ''Shark Tank'' as well, also told Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that he should consider a parade up Fifth Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  [Video: James Bond and The Queen London 2012 Performance Watch on YouTube.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Well, he should have the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The group planning Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inauguration has secured about $50 million in pledged donations since it began fund-raising in earnest last week, a breakneck pace that promises a glittering event, according to two people involved in the effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The early success puts Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on pace to easily surpass President Obama's 2009 inauguration, when his finance team raised a record $53 million to fund the inaugural festivities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The group, the Presidential Inaugural Committee, has set a fund-raising goal of $65 million to $75 million, though the final figure could well be higher, the two people said. The committee has planned a series of exclusive events around Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> swearing-in -- not unlike those planned around past inaugurations -- to help entice wealthy donors and corporations to open their checkbooks. Evidently, the events are working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Time magazine's person of 2016 is ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was announced as the Time magazine's person of the year on Wednesday -- but with a discordant note.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the magazine's editor in chief, Nancy Gibbs, put it:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''For reminding America that demagoguery feeds on despair and that truth is only as powerful as the trust in those who speak it, for empowering a hidden electorate by mainstreaming its furies and live-streaming its fears, and for framing tomorrow's political culture by demolishing yesterday's, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is Time's 2016 person of the year.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accentuated the positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's a great honor, it means a lot, especially me growing up reading Time magazine,'' he said on the ''Today'' show on NBC after the choice was announced. Throughout the campaign, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bragged at rallies about how frequently he was on the magazine's cover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And hey, last year, he said it would never happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I told you @TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite They picked person who is ruining Germany -- Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (@realDonaldTrump) December 9, 2015</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What's Joe Manchin up to?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress, says he is trying to find time for a second trip to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in New York, this time to see Reince Priebus, tapped to be the next White House chief of staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm anxious to talk to him,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What Mr. Manchin wants is unclear. Asked if he were open to serving in the cabinet, he answered, ''I'm just anxious to help my country and help my state.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And what an appointment would mean to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is equally unclear. The other red state Democrat being wooed by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team, Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, is a more obvious target. Her seat would be filled by an appointment made by North Dakota's incoming Republican governor, Doug Burgum, giving Republicans a little more cushion for their narrow Senate majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Manchin's successor would be named by West Virginia's incoming Democratic governor, Jim Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Democrats' confounding losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With Hillary Clinton's lead in the popular vote reaching 2.7 million votes, the Democrats' losses are looking increasingly improbable but very real. They are annotated on Twitter by David Wasserman, House editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.</SPAN></P>
