<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HONG KONG -- Rex W. Tillerson's call for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be denied access to its artificial islands in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, made Wednesday during his confirmation hearing for secretary of state, set the stage for a possible crisis between the world's two biggest economies should his comments become official American policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Tillerson told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> multibillion-dollar island-building campaign in the oil-and-gas rich sea was illegal and ''akin to Russia's taking of Crimea.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're going to have to send </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops,'' Mr. Tillerson told the senators. ''And second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Should those words be translated into action after Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> assumes the presidency on Jan. 20, it would be a remarkable change in the American approach to Beijing's island-building in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, which is transforming the area into what one Washington think tank said would by 2030 become ''virtually a Chinese lake.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asserts sovereignty over most of the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea despite competing claims by countries including Vietnam and the Philippines and an international ruling rejecting most of Beijing's assertions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration has challenged what it calls </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''excessive maritime claims'' in the sea by sailing warships close to the artificial islands, some of which feature deep harbors and runways capable of handling jumbo jets. But that has not stopped </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from continuing its buildup, which now includes military installations such as radar stations on more than 3,000 acres of artificial land built on reefs and shoals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Tillerson's comments, with the possible implication that the United States might use its armed forces to deny the Chinese access to the islands, garnered reactions including confusion, disbelief and warlike threats from analysts in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is a signal, now that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is set to take office, that he wants to have a tough stand on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' said Yang Chengjun, a retired senior colonel and military expert, who said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> potential war-fighting capability was greater than America's. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not stir up troubles but we are not afraid of them when they come.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, declined to answer a reporter's question about what Beijing might do if the United States Navy moved to deny </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> access to the islands, saying it was a ''hypothetical question.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But his reaction also highlighted the confusion sown by the testimony, because Mr. Tillerson did not explain how the United States could block </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I can't predict what Mr. Tillerson is thinking specifically, and on the other hand, it is impossible for me to make any prediction about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy, based on your assumptions of what he said,'' Mr. Lu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That confusion was shared by one of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most prominent experts on the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, who also questioned the legality of any American effort to block access to the islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Is this a warning? Or will this be a policy option?'' said Zhu Feng, executive director of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Center for Collaborative Studies of the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea at Nanjing University. ''If this is a policy option, this will not be able to block </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> access to these constructed islands. There is no legal basis.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team did not respond to emailed questions asking for details on Mr. Tillerson's remarks, and whether they represented the intended policy of the United States after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> assumes the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What is also not clear is the extent to which Mr. Tillerson's tough stance on the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea springs from his extensive experience in the region during his time as chief executive of Exxon Mobil, when his company became embroiled in bitter territorial disputes over the extensive oil and gas reserves beneath the seafloor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During his tenure, the company forged close ties to the Vietnamese government, signing an agreement in 2009 with a state-owned firm to drill for oil and gas in two areas in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. The agreement with PetroVietnam was signed quietly, according to a leaked United States diplomatic cable, because it conflicted with Chinese territorial claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Exxon Mobil has some operations in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including a stake in a petrochemical plant in the country's south, it has a very small presence in the country's huge retail market for gasoline, which is dominated by state-owned Chinese companies. In contrast, its agreements with Vietnam are potentially huge, given that the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea may contain 11 billion barrels of oil and 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, according to the United States Energy Information Administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil in Singapore did not return a phone call asking for comment about the company's operations in Vietnam. The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry did not reply to a request for comment about Mr. Tillerson's remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But his statements have put further strains on one of the world's most important bilateral relationships. Policy directions set by President Richard M. Nixon more than 40 years ago have remained relatively steady under the Republican and Democratic administrations that followed. But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> talk of enacting new tariffs on Chinese goods and his willingness to break decades of protocol by taking a phone call from Taiwan's president have called those policies into question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''How much farther will the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration go?'' said Mr. Zhu of Nanjing University. ''When it comes to South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, we'll have to wait and see.''</SPAN></P>
