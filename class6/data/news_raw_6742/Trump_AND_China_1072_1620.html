<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Court documents and almost daily revelations fed the furor over &quot;rape culture&quot; on college campuses after a California judge sentenced a former _________ University swimmer to just six months on three felony counts of sexual assault.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. On June 19, LeBron James delivered on the grandest stage of his superhuman career, leading the _________ to their first championship in franchise history with a 93-89 victory over the Golden State Warriors in Game 7 of the N.B.A. finals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. The same day, the Supreme Court announced that it had deadlocked in a case challenging President Obama's immigration plan, effectively ending what Mr. Obama had hoped would become one of his central legacies. The program would have shielded as many as five million _________ from deportation and allowed them to legally work in the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. On June 27, the Supreme Court reaffirmed and strengthened constitutional protections for abortion rights, striking down parts of a restrictive Texas law that could have drastically reduced the number of abortion clinics in the state. The 5-to-3 decision was the court's most sweeping statement on abortion since Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, which reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion established in 1973 in _________.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10. Three suicide attackers killed at least 41 people and wounded dozens more at _________'s main airport on June 28, in the latest in a string of terrorist attacks in Turkey, a NATO ally once seen as a bastion of stability but now increasingly consumed by the chaos of the Middle East. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 12. , the Auschwitz survivor who became an eloquent witness for the six million Jews slaughtered in World War II and who, more than anyone else, seared the memory of the Holocaust on the world's conscience, died on July 2 at the age of 87.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 13. During celebrations for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, a minivan packed with explosives blew up and killed nearly 330 people  on July 2 in central Baghdad.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 14.The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, on July 6 recommended no criminal charges against Hillary Clinton for her handling of classified information using a private _________ while she was secretary of state, lifting an enormous legal cloud from her presidential campaign. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 18. Three days later, a retaliatory attack on white police officers shocked the nation as a black Army veteran with a troubled history opened fire on officers patrolling a protest in _________ against the two earlier police shootings of black men. He killed five officers and wounded others in a standoff that ended only when the police sent an explosives-laden robot to blow him up, a tactic of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 19. Even as political leaders, protesters and law enforcement officials struggled to find common ground and lit candles of shared grief, there was an inescapable fear that the United States was being pulled further apart in its anger and anguish over the issues of race and law enforcement.

An international tribunal in The Hague delivered a sweeping rebuke on July 12 of _________'s behavior in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, including its construction of artificial islands, and found that its expansive claim to sovereignty over the waters had no legal basis. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 21. On July 14, a Tunisian immigrant with no known radical ties killed 84 people and injured hundreds in the Mediterranean city of _________.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 22. A stunning _________ in Turkey in mid-July left 260 people dead, thousands of soldiers rounded up and thousands of judges purged.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23. The Republican National Convention got off to a rocky start on July 18 with a speech from _________ that borrowed key passages, word for word, from Michelle Obama's speech at the Democratic convention eight years ago. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 24. In the most electric moment of the convention, boos and jeers broke out as it became clear that _________ - in a prime-time address from center stage - was not going to endorse Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. It was a pointed snub on the eve of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> formal acceptance speech. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 25. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accepted the Republican nomination on July 21 with a speech decrying the &quot;violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities.&quot; The party he now leads is deeply fractured, with the Washington establishment hewing to positions on trade, immigration and globalism that have been rejected by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the disaffected _________ who form much of his base. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 26. A lone gunman killed nine people and seriously injured 27 others near a shopping mall in _________ on July 22. The 18-year-old appears to have acted alone and had no apparent ties to any terrorist group. The Times writes that &quot;the horrifying rash of massacres during this violent summer suggests that public, widely covered rampage killings have led to a kind of contagion, prompting a small number of people with strong personal grievances and scant political ideology to mine previous attacks for both methods and potential targets to express their lethal anger and despair.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 27. _________, once one of the most powerful figures in the media industry, was ousted  from his job as the chairman of Fox News on July 22 as the company investigated sexual harassment allegations against him.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 28. Olympic officials sanctioned Russian athletes on July 24, but stopped short of completely barring them from the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro. Athletes had to appeal to individual sports federations to gain eligibility in the wake of widespread, government-ordered _________ at the last Olympics. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 29. _________ became a widespread obsession in mid-July, sending people into streets and parks all over the world, and spawning anecdotes about people falling off cliffs, discovering dead bodies and wandering unthinkingly into the street.  But Saudi clerics renewed a fatwa against it, calling it &quot;un-Islamic&quot;; Bosnia warned players to avoid chasing virtual monsters across very real leftover land mines; and a member of Egypt's Parliament denounced the game as &quot;the latest tool used by spy agencies.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 30. According to emails made public just days before the Democratic National Convention by WikiLeaks, top officials at the _________ criticized and mocked Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont during the primary campaign, even though the organization publicly insisted that it was neutral in the race. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 31. Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton, who sacrificed personal ambition for her husband's political career and then rose to be a globally influential figure, became the first woman to accept a major party's presidential nomination on July 28, a prize that generations of American women have dreamed about for one of their own. Declaring that the nation was at &quot;a moment of reckoning,&quot; Mrs. Clinton urged voters to reject the divisive policy ideas and combative politics of the Republican nominee, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But demonstrations inside and outside the convention hall made clear that Mrs. Clinton has some work to do to persuade at least some die-hard supporters of _________. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 32. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said on July 27 that he hoped _________ had hacked Hillary Clinton's email, essentially encouraging an adversarial foreign power's cyberspying on a secretary of state's correspondence. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> call was an extraordinary moment at a time when the country is being accused of meddling in the United States presidential election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 33. Prosecutors in Baltimore on July 27 dropped all remaining charges against three city police officers awaiting trial in the death of _________, ending one of the most closely watched - and unsuccessful - police prosecutions in the nation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 34. Four cases of _________ in Miami are highly likely to have been caused by infected mosquitoes, the state Department of Health said on July 29 - the first documented instance of local transmission in the continental United States. Meanwhile, in _________, the epidemic is raging, and the island's response is in chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 35. A federal appeals court on July 29 struck down North Carolina's _________ requirement, upending voting procedures in a crucial state slightly more than three months before Election Day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 36. A play that is being billed as the eighth book in the _________ series arrived on July 31 with an enormous first printing of 4.5 million copies and became an overnight blockbuster, selling more than two million hardcover copies in the first 48 hours. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 37. Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> belittled the parents of a _________  who had strongly denounced Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during the Democratic National Convention, saying that the soldier's father had delivered the entire speech because his mother was not &quot;allowed&quot; to speak. The confrontation between the parents, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has emerged as an unexpected and potentially pivotal flash point in the general election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 38. On his first trip to Central and Eastern Europe, _________ expressed concern that young people &quot;confuse happiness with a sofa&quot; as they become indifferent to the increasingly dark events of the world.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 39. Brazil, the first _________  country to host the Olympics, is reeling from an astonishing combination of political upheaval and economic crisis. Its efforts to stage the world's biggest sporting event have met trouble at every turn, from the Zika virus to polluted waters to budget cuts so deep that basic operations became strained. So the opening ceremony of the Summer Games arrived Aug. 5 as a salve, disguising the wounds for a few hours and letting Brazilians celebrate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 40. On Aug. 7, _________ gave the United States its first swimming gold medal of the Rio Olympics with a world record in the women's 400-meter freestyle, and Michael Phelps won his 19th Olympic gold medal as the United States won the men's 4&times;100 relay. </SPAN></P>
