</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MARRAKESH, Morocco - Diplomats at an annual United Nationsglobal warming summit meeting here expressed shock at the election of Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has called climate change a hoax and vowed to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate change accord, worrying that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency could cripple a decade of climate diplomacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And some called for retaliation to compel American compliance. Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president of France, who is again running to lead his country, suggested imposing a carbon tariff on imports from the United States, based on the amount of carbon dioxide pollution emitted to produce various goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salaheddine Mezouar, the Moroccan foreign minister, who is presiding over the Marrakesh meeting, said: &quot;We really want the U.S., naturally. It has a huge role, a huge weight.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials from the Obama administration sought to reassure the world that even if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rolls back the United States' federal climate change policy, many states and electric utilities have already turned toward investing in the growing market for low-carbon energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration rolled out a slew of last-minute regulations since the election of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and more are planned in the coming weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can't keep the waves off the beach,&quot; Ernest J. Moniz, the secretary of energy, said in an interview here, describing his message to counterparts. &quot;We are heading to a low-carbon economy. The train has left the station.&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And no government has said publicly that it will follow the United States away from the Paris agreement, which committed more than 190 countries to develop plans to combat climate change. Leading diplomats said they expected the pact to be followed with or without the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The agreement is not dependent on the U.S.,&quot; said Laurence Tubiana, the French climate change envoy, who played a key role in brokering the Paris deal. &quot;Many countries have domestic rationale for wanting to reduce their emissions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, she added, &quot;I hope President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> considers the laws of physics. Climate change will not stop, even if he stops implementing the rules.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One year ago in Paris, hundreds of diplomats celebrated the new accord. President Obama hoped to make the United States a leader in combating climate change, drafting the first American climate regulations and serving as a central broker of the Paris deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's summit meeting was intended as a low-key follow-up to agree on details for carrying out the deal. Instead, the American presidential election has taken center stage, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the world's largest greenhouse gas polluter, is poised to step forward as the world's new leader in climate diplomacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a new world order,&quot; Erik Solheim, head of the United Nations Environment Program, said. &quot;Leadership on climate change policy has now gone to the developing countries, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> among them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new analysis of carbon dioxide emissions trends published on Monday concluded that planet-warming emissions had leveled off for the past three years in a row, chiefly because of a sharp reduction in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The big story is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the last decade,&quot; said Glen Peters, a senior researcher at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo, and co-author of the study, an annual analysis published in the journal Earth System Science Data. &quot;No one expected </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> emissions to grow so fast, and no one expected them to level out and come to such a sudden halt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had long resisted pressure to enact plans to cut its emissions. But that changed after 2014, when President Xi Jinping outlined his plan to lower </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> emissions by 2030. Next year, Mr. Xi plans to start a national program to force industrial greenhouse gas emitters to pay a fee to pollute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zou Ji, deputy director general of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, which advises the government, said the Paris Agreement could survive despite Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leadership vacuum offers Beijing &quot;a way of raising its status, power and leadership in the global order,&quot; Mr. Zou said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese delegation decorated the walls of its office in red banners, photographs of nature and printouts of English-language quotations about protecting the planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Waves of new blood on board, we devote to the affairs of family, nation and globe, composing chapters of commitments,&quot; one read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Moniz tried to maintain a position for the United States on the diplomatic stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have made a huge dent by playing a role in innovation and getting the rest of the world to do it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind the scenes, many United States climate officials acknowledged that they remained shellshocked by the results of last week's election. Plans for the White House delegation to join the governments of Mexico and Canada here on Wednesday to detail a North American road map for aggressive emissions cuts by 2050 have been thrown into question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After last week's election, some longtime climate policy analysts initially feared a reprise of the fate of the world's first climate change treaty - the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. In Kyoto, Al Gore, who was then vice president, pledged that the United States, the world's largest carbon polluter at the time, would enact an ambitious climate change policy. But President George W. Bush withdrew the United States from the Kyoto accord, and it ultimately had little impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But unlike Kyoto, the Paris deal has already entered into legal force, since more than half the nations of the world have formally ratified it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no comparison with Kyoto,&quot; Mr. Mezouar said. &quot;Countries are now legally bound to Paris. They are staying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, he conceded, money is one of the crucial questions going forward. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton promised the rest of the world that rich countries would mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 to help poor countries adapt to the ravages of climate change. Without action by the United States, &quot;much of the financial contribution could be taken away,&quot; Mr. Mezouar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others said the impact of global warming might change Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mind. A study this week from the World Meteorological Organization found 2016 on track to be the hottest year on record, blowing past the records set by 2014 and 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election, in a moment when climate action has finally been mainstreamed into the economy, gives Republicans a chance to reconcile with real life,&quot; Andr&eacute; Ferretti, a coordinator of the Brazilian Climate Observatory, said. &quot;In real life, we keep breaking temperature records, and extreme events impact Democrats and Republicans alike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
