<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;On climate change, refugees, Iran and the Cuba embargo, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his loyalists have positions at odds with the United Nations.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITED NATIONS - In the genteel, carpeted halls of the United Nations headquarters, a 20-minute walk from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower, diplomats from the world over are holding their breath about the American president-elect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The optimists among them are expressing relief that Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said nothing during the campaign about dismantling the United Nations altogether - or turning its iconic tower facing the East River into condos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who represent the United States' closest allies are trying to learn who Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will appoint to crucial foreign policy jobs and how he will actually approach the pressing crises that are sure to come up before the Security Council: Syria, Ukraine, North Korea and the widening chasm between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Not least, many are trying to persuade his transition team to respect the international deals the United States has accepted under the auspices of the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's important to reaffirm that, more than ever, we need an America that's committed to world affairs,&quot; said the ambassador from France, Fran&ccedil;ois Delattre, who noted, without elaborating, that he had met with members of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> team.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah F. Cliffe, a former United Nations assistant secretary general who is now director of the Center on International Cooperation, a research organization at New York University, said she expected a reprise of the tensions that erupted between the United States and the United Nations during the administration of President George W. Bush. John R. Bolton, who was ambassador to the United Nations under Mr. Bush, once said the United Nations would be more effective without its top 10 floors, where its senior leaders have their offices. Mr. Bolton is one of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> many would-be candidates for secretary of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ms. Cliffe said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may also find the United Nations useful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He prides himself on making deals,&quot; she said. &quot;The U.N. is the forum where countries make deals in their own national interests but that also does some collective good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His own comments about the United Nations are difficult to parse. At a 2005 Senate hearing about planned renovations of the United Nations headquarters, he described himself as &quot;a big fan&quot; and said that &quot;the concept of the United Nations and the fact that the United Nations is in New York is very important to me and very important to the world as far as I am concerned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one of Manhattan's pre-eminent builders, he also offered to handle the renovation at half the price. In 2012, he complained on Twitter about the marble behind the speaker's lectern at the General Assembly hall, claiming he could build it better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cheap 12 inch sq. marble tiles behind speaker at UN always bothered me. I will replace with beautiful large marble slabs if they ask me. - Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (@realDonaldTrump) October 3, 2012</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, during a campaign speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, he excoriated the world body as &quot;not a friend to freedom,&quot; adding, &quot;it surely isn't a friend to Israel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever his specific views, a number of statements made by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his loyalists have conflicted with the values and positions of the United Nations. Here are the major examples:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Climate Change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has called climate change a hoax, has suggested he would withdraw the United States from the Paris accord, widely regarded as the most important United Nations achievement in years. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and President Obama invested a great deal of political energy in its success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any and all weather events are used by the GLOBAL WARMING HOAXSTERS to justify higher taxes to save our planet! They don't believe it $$$$! - Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2014</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. - Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This past week, speaking in Marrakesh, Morocco, at an international meeting on climate change, Mr. Ban said he had spoken by telephone with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and looked forward to a personal meeting about the importance of saving the planet from environmental disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As president of the United States, I am sure that he will understand this, he will listen, he will evaluate his campaign remarks,&quot; Mr. Ban said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not withdraw the United States from the accord, he could ignore important commitments, including cuts in carbon emissions or contributions to a global fund to help poor countries deal with the damage wrought by climate change. American disregard of the accord could cause other countries to renege on their promises as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomats are trying to convince the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team that adhering to the deal is good for American businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees and Migrants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he wants to bar entry to refugees from certain countries, and his campaign has defended a widely pilloried Twitter message by his son, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jr., comparing Syrian refugees to poisoned Skittles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barring refugees based on where they come from would be in blatant violation of international law, which requires countries to offer protection to all those fleeing war and persecution. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposal has already been denounced by the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, who said during the campaign that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be &quot;dangerous from an international point of view.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incoming United Nations secretary general, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, was even more pointed. He said that any proposal to restrict Muslim refugees would only help jihadist organizations spread their propaganda and recruit followers. &quot;It's just telling them: 'You are right. We are against you.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is to take office less than three weeks before Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iran Nuclear Agreement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has repeatedly threatened to scrap the agreement reached last year between Iran and six world powers, including the United States, that severely limited Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ban has expressed the opposite view, calling the agreement a triumph of diplomacy that reduced the threat of war. He has urged all participants to respect its provisions.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement was also endorsed by the Security Council in a unanimous resolution.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost immediately after the agreement was announced in July 2015, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> expressed his hostility in a Twitter post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Iran deal poses a direct national security threat. It must be stopped in Congress. Stand up Republicans! - Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2015</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that same Marchmeeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a lobbying group, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asserted that &quot;my No. 1 priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran,&quot; arguing that the Iranians had outsmarted the United States in winning concessions and could still develop a nuclear weapon when the pact's restrictions expire in 15 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> assertions, it remains unclear whether he will seek to annul or amend the nuclear agreement. The other countries involved - Britain, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> France, Germany, Iran and Russia - have all expressed their intention to honor it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who is under consideration for a cabinet post in the new administration, said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would probably be cautious about any change of policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think he will tear it up, and I don't think that's the way to start,&quot; Mr. Corker said on CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has vowed to restorewaterboarding as a counterterrorism tool, saying &quot;torture works.&quot; That would contravene an international convention on torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kris Kobach, a member of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team, has suggested that the new administration could create a national registry for immigrants from countries where terrorist groups are active. That would go against an international convention on nondiscrimination, which took effect nearly 50 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western powers have sought to use the United Nations to highlight rights abuses they attribute to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has made clear that whatever war crimes Mr. Assad may have carried out, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first priority is the Islamic State. &quot;I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS,&quot; he said in October. &quot;Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arms Trade Treaty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not specified his view on the Arms Trade Treaty, which was overwhelmingly adopted in 2013 by the General Assembly and entered into legal force nearly two years ago. But gun-rights advocates in the United States led by the National Rifle Association, one of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most powerful supporters, strongly criticized the treaty and vowed to ensure that the Senate never ratifies it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The #NRA stood with @realDonaldTrump and won.&quot; https://t.co/y45tpSTuUT#2A - NRA (@NRA) November 9, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The treaty is an attempt to regulate the enormous global trade in conventional weapons, and for the first time it links sales to the human rights records of the buyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The N.R.A. has argued that the treaty's provisions amount to an infringement of the Second Amendment. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican senator from New Hampshire who is among those being talked about as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> potential ambassador to United Nations, has been an outspoken critic of the treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israel and Palestinians</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> precise views are unclear on this question, which has vexed the United Nations for decades. But he has said he is &quot;100 percent&quot; in favor of moving the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the holy city that Israel claims as its undivided capital. Such a change would be a major break from longstanding American policy and would infuriate the Palestinians, who want at least part of Jerusalem to be the capital of a future Palestinian state. The secretary general has called Jerusalem &quot;the heart of any negotiated solution to the question of Palestine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relations With Cuba</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has sharply criticized President Obama's reconciliation with Cuba, a change that was widely welcomed at the United Nations, where an annual resolution condemning the American trade embargo with Cuba passes overwhelmingly. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> running mate, Mike Pence, has vowed that the new administration's policy will be much tougher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.@realDonaldTrump will repeal Obama's Executive Orders on Cuba &amp; continue the embargo until there is real political &amp; religious freedom - Mike Pence (@mike_pence) November 5, 2016</SPAN></P>
