<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may push us into another war.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I continue to be astonished that not enough Americans are sufficiently alarmed and abashed by the dangerous idiocies that continue to usher forth from the mouth of the man who will on Friday be inaugurated as president of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toss ideology out of the window. This is about democracy and fascism, war and peace, life and death. I wish that I could write those words with the callous commercialism with which some will no doubt read them, as overheated rhetoric simply designed to stir agitation, provoke controversy and garner clicks. But alas, they are not. These words are the sincere dispatches of an observer, writer and citizen who continues to see worrisome signs of a slide toward the exceedingly unimaginable by a man who is utterly unprepared.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a series of interviews and testimonies Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his cronies have granted in the last several days, they have demonstrated repeatedly how destabilizing, unpredictable and indeed unhinged the incoming administration may be. Their comments underscore the degree to which this administration may not simply alter our democracy beyond recognition, but also potentially push us into armed conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> secretary of state nominee, Rex Tillerson, said during his confirmation hearing that the United States had to &quot;send </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops, and second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only way to do this is with some sort of naval blockade, which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would undoubtedly interpret as an act of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, as Business Insider reported,Chinese state-run media responded in an editorial, &quot;Unless Washington plans to wage a large-scale war in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, any other approaches to prevent Chinese access to the islands will be foolish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business Insider quoted Bonnie Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia and the director of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who pointed out that Tillerson's position could easily result in war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the United States put &quot;a cordon of ships around one or all of the islands, and the Chinese flew in aircraft to one of their new islands, what are we going to do? Shoot it down?&quot; Glaser asked. &quot;We'd certainly end up in a shooting war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even short of the conflict over the islands, The Wall Street Journal's Andrew Browne suggested Tuesday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> talk on trade alone could escalate into an armed conflict with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he will make continued adherence to the &quot;one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; policy - which recognizes Beijing as the sole government of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - conditional on negotiations over what he sees as currency manipulation and other unfair trade practices by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Browne points out:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The gambit has profound security and military implications. Taiwan is a regional flash point. Beijing regards the island as an inalienable part of Chinese territory; 'One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> expresses not just its political desire for unification but a core part of Chinese identity. Chinese leaders will fight for it. They can't lose Taiwan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make no mistake: As bad of an actor as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is, the United States actually depends on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. It is one of our biggest trade partners, but furthermore it is one of the last remaining checks on an erratic North Korea. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could simply stop using its influence to make North Korea behave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as you may recall, during the campaign </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggested that the way to contain North Korea was for nuclear proliferation in the region. In March, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said of nuclear weapons: &quot;You have so many countries already - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Pakistan, you have so many countries, Russia - you have so many countries right now that have them.&quot; He continued: &quot;Now, wouldn't you rather, in a certain sense, have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is the destabilizing and downright frightening random rhetoric. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has suggested that he equally trusts America's friend-in-arms Angela Merkel and his friend-in-spirit Vladimir Putin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told The Washington Post this week that he may start having military parades in major American cities &agrave; la North Korea: &quot;Being a great president has to do with a lot of things, but one of them is being a great cheerleader for the country.&quot; He continued: &quot;And we're going to show the people as we build up our military, we're going to display our military. That military may come marching down Pennsylvania Avenue. That military may be flying over New York City and Washington, D.C., for parades. I mean, we're going to be showing our military.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continues to trash NATO, calling it &quot;obsolete.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is insanity. But too many Americans don't want to see this threat for what it is. International affairs and the very real threat of escalating militarization and possibly even military conflict seems much harder to grasp than the latest inflammatory tweet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe people think this possibility is unthinkable. Maybe people are just hoping and praying that cooler heads will prevail. Maybe they think that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advisers will smarten him up and talk him down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But where is your precedent for that? When has this man been cautious or considerate? This man with loose lips and tweeting thumbs may very well push us into another war, and not with a country like Afghanistan, but with a nuclear-armed country with something to prove.</SPAN></P>
