<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A recount effort in the United States presidential election that began in Wisconsin may extend this week to two more states narrowly lost by Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dismissed the effort as a &quot;scam&quot; and unleashed a daylong storm of Twitter posts, including asserting without evidence that his shortfall in the popular vote was because of &quot;millions of people&quot; voting illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Twitter outburst also came as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is laboring to fill crucial positions in his cabinet. An adviser assailed Mitt Romney, one the top candidates for secretary of state, as having gone &quot;out of his way to hurt&quot; the president-elect in the primaries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business dealings around the globe are raising widespread concerns over conflicts of interest. One example is a postelection telephone call with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, in which the president-elect praised his business associate in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Towers in Istanbul, above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Scotland, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> built a wall on the border of his golf course, blocking the sea view of local residents, and then sent them the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon, a conservative government veteran who called for economic sacrifice, major changes in the workplace and a crackdown on immigration and Islam, won a runoff to represent France's center-right Republican Party in April's presidential contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcome paved the way for a likely face-off with the country's far-right party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cuban government is rolling out plans for a nine-day period of &quot;Duelo Nacional,&quot; or national pain, after the death of Fidel Castro, 90.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country, which defied the United States for nearly half a century before hostilities eased, remains firmly in the grip of his brother, Ra&uacute;l Castro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The capital, Havana, has been quiet, but Cuban exiles celebrated in Miami. Mr. Castro's ashes will be interred on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Tbilisi, Georgia, a two-room apartment shared by a computer science student and his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America's fake news industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did not write to make </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> win,&quot; the student said. &quot;I just wanted to get viewers and make some money.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Swiss voters rejected a proposal to phase out nuclear power by 2029. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American retailers have geared up for Cyber Monday, the last day of deals in what has become an annual shopping weekend. Sales rose 18 percent over last year, to $5.3 billion. Visits to brick-and-mortar stores dipped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The European Court of Justice will hear arguments on Tuesday that will most likely determine how Uber can operate across the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our business columnist tracked the fortune of J. K. Rowling, the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; author. He estimates Ms. Rowling's net worth at $1.2 billion, noting that she pays taxes and gives generously to charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A start-up thinks it may have found the secret to growing truffles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Montenegro, a detained mercenary is slowly spilling his guts on a purported plot orchestrated by two Russians to kill the prime minister and install a new government hostile to NATO. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Viktor F. Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine, said that he regretted not ordering troops to disperse the mass protests that forced him into exile in Russia. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. officials say they will close a protest camp that has drawn thousands of Native Americans opposed to an oil pipeline in North Dakota. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I see the anger I was raised with rocking the nation.&quot; A young American who renounced white nationalism considers the wave of white rage that aligned behind Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as he ascended to the White House. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A weekslong chess battle between Sergey Karjakin of Russia and the defending world champion, Magnus Carlsen of Norway, could end today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simmering Cold War tensions have given the match weightier geopolitical overtones. A Russian spokesman said that President Vladimir V. Putin receives constant updates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anger rooms let customers smash objects to release their rage. Sessions are meant to be therapeutic, but mental health professionals question the efficacy of rampaging in a faux cubicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nico Rosberg, driving for Mercedes, became the second son of a Formula One world champion to win the title himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Hero of the Empire,&quot; an account of Winston Churchill's time in South Africa, and &quot;Iza's Ballad,&quot; a meditative Hungarian novel, are among our 100 Notable Books of 2016. Here's the full list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And just look at these trees in Lapland, Finland's northernmost region. They are so coated in frosty rime that they could be mistaken for towers of shaving foam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That banana you might be having for breakfast is probably a Cavendish, the most widely available variety of one of the world's most popular fruits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a deadly fungus is on the march, and the Cavendish's lack of genetic diversity is raising fears of a possible &quot;bananapocalypse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killer, a strain of Panama disease called Tropical Race 4, has spread to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and the Northern Territory of Australia, and has recently been found in Africa and the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With its yellow peel and seedless fruit, the Cavendish makes up 95 percent of bananas sold worldwide, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous dominant variety, the Gros Michel, was devastated by another form of the fungus in the 1950s. Growers turned to the Cavendish, whose strength lies more in disease resistance than flavor. (One expert said it &quot;had been considered something close to junk.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cavendish is thought to have arrived in England in the 1800s from Mauritius, taking its name from the family in whose greenhouse it was cultivated. Missionaries eventually carried it to the Pacific islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One scientist sees a silver lining in newly urgent efforts to save the seeds from wild bananas. &quot;Race 4 is a threat,&quot; he says, &quot;but it's also an opportunity to start growing more diversity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
