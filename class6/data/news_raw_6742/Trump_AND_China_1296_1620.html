<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- ''I am not a neocon,'' House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said on Thursday, mapping out a series of foreign policy views that separated him from virtually all of the Republicans who have sought the presidential nomination this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more than 30 minutes, Mr. Ryan -- who this week disavowed any interest in the Republican nomination -- critiqued President Obama's reluctance to act more forcefully, and dismissed threats from the Republican front-runner, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to pull American forces back unless allies contribute more money. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ryan never mentioned Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner and former secretary of state. Perhaps that was because the policies he described, more hawkish than the current president's but far more cautious than most of the prescriptions for bolstering American power heard in his own party, sounded almost Clintonesque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Who else is going to lead the world to make the global commons more peaceful?'' he asked, echoing a question Mrs. Clinton has posed when, borrowing from former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, she has referred to the United States as the ''indispensable nation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He talked mostly about how he would deal with the complicated Middle East, including how leaders there had critiqued the Iran nuclear accord recently when he took a trip through Israel and several Sunni Arab states with a congressional delegation. His website displayed a video of the trip that included his motorcades, his meetings and visits to the Western Wall and the Temple Mount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Ryan did not say he would walk away from the terms of the Iran nuclear deal or offer views, as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did in a recent interview with The New York Times, on how he would have negotiated a stronger one. Instead, he said America must strictly enforce its terms and impose new costs on Iran for its ballistic missile tests -- which do not violate the deal but may violate a new United Nations resolution that calls upon Iran to refrain from testing any missile that can carry a nuclear weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton, in a speech shortly after the deal was struck, embraced its terms but also called for enforcement so strict that the United States would leap upon any violation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the most interesting elements of Mr. Ryan's 35-minute bagels-and-coffee breakfast with a group of reporters was his argument that Mr. Obama was right to be concerned about engaging America in new conflicts but had taken caution to a paralyzing extreme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He is in a massive retrenchment,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''I think he has gone way too far.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ryan said the Middle Eastern leaders he met were concerned about America's long-term direction, especially that Washington is willing to let Iran take on a larger role in the Middle East. Those conversations appeared largely in line with what Secretary of State John Kerry confronted in his own encounter with Sunni Arab allies in Bahrain last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Mr. Ryan has insisted he is not interested in the nomination, the policy he described -- which never turned to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> North Korea or nuclear proliferation -- was clearly at the more moderate, internationalist extreme of the party, a place where many Republicans and more hawkish Democrats often find common ground. He talked about increasing military power, adding ships to the Navy and making more Army brigades battle-ready, but also sounded hesitant about using that power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He spoke of having a ''limited view of the projection of force,'' and said that America's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan showed that ''we are really good at winning the front end of these things'' but not preparing for ''the long haul'' of making the things work after the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That description of America's issues sounds much like Mr. Obama's when he was first running for president in 2008. But Mr. Ryan argued that in pulling back from the conflict in Syria, Mr. Obama has sowed uncertainty among the allies. It is an argument the president has resisted, most notably in a long interview with Jeffrey Goldberg in The Atlantic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ryan said that as a member of the House, he had always wanted to be a member of the Intelligence Committee, but could not while he was deeply involved in the budget. As speaker, he said, he is now ''read in to all Title 50'' operations -- intelligence operations -- which he declined to evaluate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In discussing his views, Mr. Ryan seemed familiar with the major players in the Middle East and described at length his concerns about allies' perceptions of American power. But he was more descriptive than analytical, more likely to convey what he heard than dissect the forces driving change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Syria, for example, he did not put forth any new proposals that would differ from the Obama administration's approach of modest support for the Syrian rebel groups and a negotiation process for a cease-fire and eventual transition of power away from Bashar al-Assad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He talked in general terms on Egypt, and pressing for greater human rights, but said nothing about what leverage he would use to encourage change in an increasingly authoritarian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His answers were crisp, and far less meandering than Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during an interview two weeks ago. He separated himself from the New York real estate developer early in the conversation, saying that ''when he proposed the Muslim immigration ban, that got under my skin.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said he opposed all ''fortress America'' solutions, and said that ''if we think we are going to pull back from the world'' and let vast oceans be America's defense against attack, ''the last two decades disprove that theory.''</SPAN></P>
