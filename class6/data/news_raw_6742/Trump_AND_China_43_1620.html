</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction Appended</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'s leaders have been markedly reticent about what kind of leader they think Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be. A pragmatic dealmaker, as his business background might indicate? Or a provocateur who tests the ways of statecraft?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By talking on Friday with Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> answered that question in stark terms, Chinese analysts said Saturday. Breaking decades of American diplomatic practice, he caught the Chinese government off guard by lunging into the most sensitive of its so-called core interests, the &quot;One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; policy agreed to by President Richard M. Nixon more than four decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a wake-up call for Beijing - we should buckle up for a pretty rocky six months or year in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-U.S. relationship,&quot; Wang Dong, an associate professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University, said Saturday. &quot;There was a sort of delusion based on overly optimistic ideas about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. That should stop.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese leaders covet stability in their relationship with Washington, and perhaps for that reason, they have allowed fairly rosy assessments of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to appear in the state-run news media. Many of those accounts have depicted the president-elect as a practical operator devoid of ideology, the kind of person </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might find common ground with despite his threats of a trade war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the hope of maintaining a relatively smooth relationship as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> begins his administration, Beijing will probably take a wait-and-see attitude despite his phone call with Ms. Tsai, said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first official reaction, from Foreign Minister Wang Yi, was fairly benign - though it was firm in reiterating the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy, under which the United States formally recognized Beijing as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sole government in 1978 and broke ties with Taiwan a year later. No American president or president-elect had spoken to a Taiwanese president since then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wang blamed Ms. Tsai's government for arranging the call. &quot;It won't stand a chance to change the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy agreed upon by the international community,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A follow-up statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday, noting that the ministry had filed a formal complaint with the United States government, was similar in tone. It urged &quot;relevant parties in the U.S.&quot; to &quot;deal with the Taiwan issue in a prudent, proper manner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders disdain Ms. Tsai, of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party, who was elected president this year after pledging to wean the island off its economic dependence on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a policy that won enthusiastic support from younger Taiwanese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> favored her original opponent, Hung Hsiu-chu of the Kuomintang, which has sought closer ties with mainland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (Ms. Hung later dropped out of the race.) Before the election, President Xi Jinping of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> met with Ms. Tsai's predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, also of the Kuomintang, in the first encounter between the leaders of the two governments, a rapprochement that Beijing had long sought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> broke a Chinese taboo merely by using Ms. Tsai's title. The Chinese state news media refer to the Taiwanese president as the &quot;leader of the Taiwan region,&quot; to indicate that Beijing regards Taiwan not as a sovereign nation but as Chinese territory to eventually be brought under its control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A basic tenet of the Chinese government is that Taiwan, where Chiang Kai-shek's forces fled in 1949 after losing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> civil war, will be brought back into the fold. According to Mr. Xi, Taiwan is destined to become an integral part of his so-called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dream, a vision of an economically successful Communist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> astride the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> phone call also violated a longstanding principle of American policy: that the president does not speak to the head of Taiwan's government, despite selling arms to it. &quot;Interesting how the US sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call,&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said on Twitter after the stunned reaction to his conversation with Ms. Tsai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Beijing vehemently protests the arms sales, it also warily acknowledges them as part of long-established practice. Since the mid-1990s, Washington has signaled to Taiwan that it will not support any military effort to gain independence from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration's last arms sale to Taiwan, in 2015, was relatively modest - consisting of antitank missiles, two frigates and surveillance gear, worth $1.8 billion in total - but it still provoked a bitter denunciation from Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douglas H. Paal, a former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, which represents American interests there, said it would not be surprising if the United States sold arms to Taiwan early in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration. Beijing's reaction would depend on the price tag, the kinds of weapons sold and how the administration informed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the sale, Mr. Paal said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it broke diplomatic precedent, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> conversation with Ms. Tsai could be seen in some ways as following a pattern of Republican presidents' reaching out to Taiwan, although others did not do so before taking office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George W. Bush, for example, was vocal in his support of Taiwan early in his presidency, saying in a television interview that the United States would do &quot;whatever it took&quot; to defend it. His aides said afterward that the comment did not reflect a change in the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy. By the end of his second term, Mr. Bush had helped to strengthen trade ties between Beijing and Washington through the approval of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> entry into the World Trade Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has received generally favorable coverage in the state news media, some Chinese analysts have expressed irritation with him, and some have suggested that his administration will offer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opportunities to show strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yan Xuetong, a professor of international relations at Tsinghua University and a foreign policy hawk, said the overall tenor of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-United States relationship in the coming years would depend a great deal on the personal chemistry between Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mr. Xi. He said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with its growing military and the second-largest economy in the world, could largely afford to act as it liked. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is increasingly resilient to the United States,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, took a contrarian view of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> call with Ms. Tsai: He said it was not a problem because Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had yet to take office. &quot;He is a private citizen,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if such contacts continue after Inauguration Day, Mr. Shen said, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should end diplomatic relations with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would close our embassy in Washington and withdraw our diplomats,&quot; he said. &quot;I would be perfectly happy to end the relationship. I don't know how you are then going to expect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to cooperate on Iran and North Korea and climate change. You are going to ask Taiwan for that?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction: January 4, 2017, Wednesday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Dec. 4 about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> likely re-evaluation of President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after his telephone call to Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, referred incompletely to the presidential candidacy of Hung Hsui-chu of the Kuomintang party. Favored by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, she initially challenged Ms. Tsai, but later dropped out of the race.</SPAN></P>
