<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Lin Fei-fan led the charge nearly three years ago when hundreds of students occupied Taiwan's legislature to protest a trade deal with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. With the island's economy increasingly tied to the mainland's, and Beijing's global influence on the rise, he worried that Taiwan's independence was at stake -- and might be a lost cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, thanks to a couple of sentences uttered by Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a talk show, Mr. Lin has new hope. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president-elect stunned the world on Sunday by suggesting he might abandon the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> principle, the bedrock understanding under which the United States established relations with Beijing and cut official ties with Taiwan nearly four decades ago. His apparent willingness to rethink longstanding American policy that prioritizes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over Taiwan has energized Mr. Lin, 28, and many like him. But it has also left them anxious, and asking:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What does it mean for one's homeland to be put on the table by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, an inveterate deal maker, in negotiations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Communist leaders, who are not known for making concessions easily?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Many people in Taiwan worry that once </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> takes office, he'll make a U-turn,'' Mr. Lin said. ''We are suspicious of his motivations.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even as he has elevated Taiwan's status by speaking on the phone with its president, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has left the impression that he sees the island primarily as leverage to extract compromises from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on other issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I don't know why we have to be bound by a One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy unless we make a deal with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> having to do with other things, including trade,'' he said, before also citing Beijing's military buildup in the disputed South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea and its support for North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not since Richard M. Nixon traveled to Beijing in 1972 to dangle the prospect of abandoning Taiwan has an American leader so explicitly attempted to use it as a bargaining chip with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which considers the self-governing island of 23 million to be part of Chinese territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The gambit has both exhilarated and unnerved the people of Taiwan, who yearn for greater international recognition but have long been worried about being sacrificed as a pawn in a geopolitical chess game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many have applauded Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stand, describing his decision to break protocol and speak by phone with Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's leader, as an overdue gesture toward one of Washington's most reliable friends in Asia and a young democracy. Taiwan is the United States' ninth-largest trading partner and has purchased more than $46 billion in American weapons since 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But residents are also coming to grips with the reality that their most vocal champion on the world stage now is a businessman known for his love of cutting deals and his erratic approach to policy making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's an uncontrollable force,'' said Hsu Tse-mei, 57, a retired bank manager in Taipei. ''We're caught between two powerful countries, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States, and we're at the mercy of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The stakes are high and help explain why Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> predecessors have generally left the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy untouched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since the Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan in 1949 after the Communist Revolution, generations of Chinese leaders have vowed to reunify the island with the mainland and threatened war to prevent it from formally declaring independence. In the mid-1990s, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fired missiles into waters off Taiwan in an attempt to intimidate supporters of a formal separation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the United States established relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 1979, dropping its official recognition of the Nationalist, or Kuomintang, government in Taiwan, it secured a pledge from Beijing that its ''fundamental policy'' was to pursue reunification by peaceful means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many in Taiwan are now afraid that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could reconsider that commitment if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> scraps the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm worried that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may take military action against Taiwan,'' said Li Meng-chieh, 33, a graphic designer in Taipei. ''If that happens, it will derail our current way of life.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such worries extend even to supporters of President Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party has long favored greater independence from the mainland and has traditionally been willing to accept greater risks to pursue it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Tsai's administration has repeatedly assured </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of its desire to maintain the status quo, and Lo Chih-cheng, a lawmaker from her party, said officials in Taiwan had avoided playing up the phone call with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> so as not to antagonize Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We have tried to behave ourselves,'' Mr. Lo said. ''But obviously </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was not happy about it, so they chose Taiwan to blame. They used Taiwan as a scapegoat to divert their domestic discontent.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jason Hu, a vice chairman of the opposition Nationalist Party, said initial excitement over the phone call had become regret. ''It's a big power play that Taiwan should not be involved in,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Taiwanese society is deeply divided on the issue of closer relations with the mainland. Some see the island's prosperity as inextricably linked to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, while others are worried that Taiwan is already too dependent on the Chinese economy and thus vulnerable to pressure from Beijing. But few in Taiwan are interested in reunification under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> authoritarian political system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Chinese leadership is worried Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will make its goal of reunification even more difficult to achieve and embolden those in Taiwan who want to pursue greater international recognition and a more formal break with the mainland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The government in Beijing has ratcheted up its criticism of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in recent days, including with an editorial in a state-run newspaper that called him ''as ignorant as a child'' on foreign policy and suggested </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might offer military assistance to American enemies in retaliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is likely to lash out against Taiwan first. ''The Chinese can punish Taiwan and get away with it,'' said Steve Tsang, director of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, ''but they can't do that to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Mr. Nixon met with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, he hoped to use the prospect of a break with Taiwan and normalization of relations with Beijing to drive a wedge between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Soviet Union and secure </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> help in ending the Vietnam War. But President Xi Jinping of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has taken a hard line against independence for Taiwan and Hong Kong and may not have much room to maneuver given rising nationalist sentiment in the party and the broader public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Analysts said it would be politically difficult for Mr. Xi to offer concessions on trade or security issues in the face of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> statements on the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy, which Beijing has long portrayed as nonnegotiable and the prerequisite for cooperation on other issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This will put Xi Jinping under pressure at home,'' said Su Chi, chairman of the Taipei Forum, a nonpartisan think tank, and a former official in the Nationalist Party, which favors closer ties with the mainland. ''He will have to take action to show that he can't be played around and taken advantage of by the Taiwanese president.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other Republican presidents who have expressed support for Taiwan -- Ronald Reagan pledged to continue arms sales indefinitely, and George W. Bush vowed to do ''whatever it took'' to defend the island if attacked by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- generally did so in ideological terms, supporting its evolution into the world's only Chinese democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not made such statements, and that has prompted many in Taiwan to question the health of the island's relationship with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some argue that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> approach should be a sign that Taiwan cannot rely on Washington and needs to strengthen ties with other countries in Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Others say that he has presented Taiwan with a chance to expand trade with the United States and build support among the American public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We need to talk to the American people so they can have a deeper understanding of Taiwan. We want to tell them that we are their true ally and that we share many common values,'' said Huang Kuo-chang, chairman of the New Power Party, which emerged from the student protests in 2014 that successfully blocked the trade deal with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Lin, the student protest leader, said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had opened a potential path for Taiwan to gain the international recognition that he and others have been fighting so long for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But sitting at a Taipei cafe behind a laptop computer with a sticker that read, ''When dictatorship is a fact, revolution is a duty,'' Mr. Lin also acknowledged that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was an unlikely and perhaps unreliable ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are not na&iuml;ve,'' he said. ''We don't believe that the election of a new U.S. president will necessarily bring about huge changes. But if there's an opportunity, we will definitely not give it up.''</SPAN></P>
