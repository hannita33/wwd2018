</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Up to one million people are trapped in the Iraqi city of Mosul, running low on food and drinking water and facing the worsening cruelty of Islamic State fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Syria, the removal of residents in Aleppo and nearby villages proceeded tenuously after rebels set fire to several buses. Videos on social media show the harrowing journey of more than 8,000 people evacuated in the past few days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Security Council will vote today on sending monitors to observe the evacuation. &quot;This would give us collectively the tools to avoid another Srebrenica,&quot; the French ambassador said, referring to a massacre of civilians in Bosnia in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The American outcry over Russian interventionin the presidential election is growing, even as Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continues his march into office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next step toward his inauguration is today's vote by the Electoral College, a body created early in the country's history as a compromise between those who wanted Congress to choose the president and those who favored a popular vote. It may not be the usual rubber stamp: At least one elector has said he will buck his party and not vote for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trails in the popular vote by more than 2.5 million, the third-worst margin among winning candidates since 1824.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Patriot News is among a constellation of European websites that pumped out anti-Hillary Clinton misinformation and propaganda before the U.S. election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the Macedonian teenagers running fake news factories solely for profit, this site's founder, above, is ideologically motivated: He is a British far-right political activist who is a fan of Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Across Europe, sentiment is shifting against the E.U. We spoke to some Slovaks, who now see Brussels as &quot;incomprehensible, from a different era.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The E.U. faces a series of critical tests in 2017, but none is more important than the French presidential election, with Marine Le Pen, above, a fierce opponent of the bloc, a leading contender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A verdict in the trial of Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is expected this afternoon in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Lagarde is accused of &quot;negligence by a person in a position of public authority,&quot; in a matter related to her time as finance minister of France. The public prosecutor said last week that the testimony presented did not appear to be sufficient to merit a conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Early next year, Finland will begin handing out cash to 2,000 jobless people, free of bureaucracy or limits on side earnings, to see if they will pursue jobs, start businesses or just squander the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zalando, Europe's largest online fashion retailer, is using a made-in-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> approach to take on Amazon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ukraine nationalized PrivatBank, the country's largest lender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ireland said it would appeal the E.U.'s landmark order to collect a record 13 billion euros in taxes from Apple, arguing the bloc had overstepped its authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protests continued in Poland as its conservative government and pro-E.U. opposition tussled over new media restrictions and other changes, which critics said curbed freedoms. [TheAssociated Press]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Jordan's south, seven security personnel, two Jordanian civilians and a Canadian tourist were killed by gunmen in a series of attacks, including at an ancient crusader castle. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The muted U.S. response to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> capture of an American underwater drone has Washington's regional allies worried about further exposure to an increasingly assertive Beijing. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forty-two migrants were hospitalized in Croatia after the police found a van crammed with 67 people, including children, traveling through the country. [The Associated Press]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police in Berlin arrested a man suspected of kicking a woman down a flight of stairs at a subway station. Video footage of the act had gone viral. [Deutsche Welle]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An Arctic village is swarming with polar bears because the sea ice they rely on for hunting seals is retreating so fast. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Beethoven score went unsold at Sotheby's after a scholar called it a fake, raising questions about transparency in auctions. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Was Anne Frank's family betrayed? Historians have a new theory. [The Washington Post]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Canada has welcomed Syrian refugees like no other country. But 10-year-old Bayan Mohammad's parents worry that she is leaving too much behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Premier League, Arsenal is experiencing its traditional November implosion in mid-December. &quot;We have had a horrible week,&quot; Manager Ars&egrave;ne Wenger said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japan is producing award-winning whiskeys that connoisseurs covet. A Times reporter toured the distilleries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's begin the week talking about holiday spirits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dried hibiscus flowers steeped with ginger mean it's Christmastime in Jamaica. Mulled wine with port and brandy makes for a fine gl&ouml;gg in Scandinavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christmas by the beach comes with coquito, a Puerto Rican rum-based cocktail. Recipes are like heirlooms for many families there and flavors include chocolate and banana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flour derived from orchid bulbs binds sahlab, a creamy Middle Eastern beverage. In Lithuania, poppy milk, made from poppy seeds steeped in water and honey, is served on Christmas Eve as part of the Twelve Dishes feast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British tradition of wassailing in exchange for a bowl of hot mulled cider dates back centuries, as does eggnog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most historians agree that eggnog, the egg, milk and bourbon concoction, originated in medieval England and eventually made its way to North America in the 1700s. A recipe from 1958 ran in The Times as the beverage made a comeback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its popularity had dimmed near the end of the previous century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans appeared unwilling &quot;to sacrifice future well-being for the sake of a momentary gratification,&quot; a writer lamented, &quot;even though sanctioned by the precept and example of our ancestors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever your drink of choice is, sharing is the key ingredient. Happy holidays.</SPAN></P>
