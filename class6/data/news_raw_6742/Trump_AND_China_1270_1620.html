</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underneath the nostalgia and hope in President Obama's farewell address Tuesday night was a darker theme: the struggle to help the people on the losing end of technological change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The next wave of economic dislocations won't come from overseas,&quot; Mr. Obama said. &quot;It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good, middle-class jobs obsolete.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has tended to blame trade, offshoring and immigration. Mr. Obama acknowledged those things have caused economic stress. But without mentioning Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he said they divert attention from the bigger culprit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists agree that automation has played a far greater role in job loss, over the long run, than globalization. But few people want to stop technological progress. Indeed, the government wants to spur more of it. The question is how to help those that it hurts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inequality caused by automation is a main driver of cynicism and political polarization, Mr. Obama said. He connected it to the racial and geographic divides that have cleaved the country post-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not just racial minorities and others like immigrants, the rural poor and transgender people who are struggling in society, he said, but also &quot;the middle-aged white guy who, from the outside, may seem like he's got advantages, but has seen his world upended by economic and cultural and technological change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technological change will soon be a problem for a much bigger group of people, if it isn't already. Fifty-one percent of all the activities Americans do at work involve predictable physical work, data collection and data processing. These are all tasks that are highly susceptible to being automated, according to a report McKinsey published in July using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and O*Net to analyze the tasks that constitute 800 jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-eight percent of work activities involve tasks that are less susceptible to automation but are still at risk, like unpredictable physical work or interacting with people. Just 21 percent are considered safe for now, because they require applying expertise to make decisions, do something creative or manage people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The service sector, including health care and education jobs, is considered safest. Still, a large part of the service sector is food service, which McKinsey found to be the most threatened industry, even more than manufacturing. Seventy-three percent of food service tasks could be automated, it found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December, the White House released a report on automation, artificial intelligence and the economy, warning that the consequences could be dire: &quot;The country risks leaving millions of Americans behind and losing its position as the global economic leader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one knows how many people will be threatened, or how soon, the report said. It cited various researchers' estimates that from 9 percent to 47 percent of jobs could be affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the best case, it said, workers will have higher wages and more leisure time. In the worst, there will be &quot;significantly more workers in need of assistance and retraining as their skills no longer match the demands of the job market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology delivers its benefits and harms in an unequal way. That explains why even though the economy is humming, it doesn't feel like it for a large group of workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education is the main solution the White House advocated. When the United States moved from an agrarian economy to an industrialized economy, it rapidly expanded high school education: By 1951, the average American had 6.2 more years of education than someone born 75 years earlier. The extra education enabled people to do new kinds of jobs, and explains 14 percent of the annual increases in labor productivity during that period, economists say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the country faces a similar problem. Machines can do many low-skilled tasks, and American children, especially those from low-income and minority families, lag behind their peers in other countries educationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House proposed enrolling more 4-year-olds in preschool and making two years of community college free for students, as well as teaching more skills like computer science and critical thinking. For people who have already lost their jobs, it suggested expanding apprenticeships and retraining programs, on which the country spends half what it did 30 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Displaced workers also need extra government assistance, the report concluded. It suggested ideas like additional unemployment benefits for people who are in retraining programs or live in states hardest hit by job loss. It also suggested wage insurance for people who lose their jobs and have to take a new one that pays less. Someone who made $18.50 an hour working in manufacturing, for example, would take an $8 pay cut if he became a home health aide, one of the jobs that is growing most quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama, in his speech Tuesday, named some other policy ideas for dealing with the problem: stronger unions, an updated social safety net and a tax overhaul so that the people benefiting most from technology share some of their earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration probably won't agree with many of those solutions. But the economic consequences of automation will be one of the biggest problems it faces.</SPAN></P>
