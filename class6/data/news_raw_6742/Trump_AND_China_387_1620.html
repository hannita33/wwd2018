<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAMPA, Fla. -- Leaning heavily on her tenure as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton assailed Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> national security credentials on Tuesday, portraying him as a bungling businessman unequipped to serve as commander in chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''He says he has a secret plan to defeat ISIS. The secret is, he has no plan,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a blistering speech here dripping with ridicule directed at her Republican rival. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton repeatedly referred to her experiences as the nation's top diplomat -- and enlisted her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, to do the same in his first national security address -- to draw a contrast with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton's emphasis on her experience in global stagecraft comes a week after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tried to bolster his foreign policy credentials with a trip to Mexico. Mrs. Clinton called the trip ''an embarrassing international incident.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He got into a Twitter war with the president of Mexico,'' she added, alluding to Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto. ''He is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the United States.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in turn, addressed Mrs. Clinton's own qualifications at an event in Virginia Beach. Asked if questions about Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state made her unfit to serve as commander in chief, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> replied with a quip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's such a long answer to that question,'' he said to laughter. ''Could go on for days.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will also use a speech on Wednesday in Philadelphia to call for the end of the military sequester as a way to increase defense spending, according to a senior adviser who spoke anonymously in order to discuss campaign strategy. The speech is also intended to contrast Mrs. Clinton's foreign policy vision -- which Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> described on Tuesday night as ''military adventurism'' -- with what he says is a more cautious approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Wednesday night, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will answer questions in a televised forum on national security hosted by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a preview of what she might say during the forum, Mrs. Clinton recalled on Tuesday the tense 2011 decision in the White House Situation Room to send a team of Navy SEALs to raid a compound in Pakistan believed to be harboring Osama bin Laden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Would it be a missile strike? Would it be a bombing? Would it be an attack?'' she said, quieting the crowd. ''I was one of the ones who said I thought it was worth the risk,'' she said as a woman in the audience shouted, ''You go, girl!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The renewed emphasis on national security coincided with news that 88 retired generals and military officials had released an open letter endorsing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, saying his presidency would bring a ''long overdue course correction in our national security posture.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked at a news conference about the endorsements, Mrs. Clinton pretended to brush them off. ''I think 88 flag officers?'' she said. ''I think we're up to 89, but who's counting?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She added that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military endorsements fell far short of the 300 to 500 endorsements the past two Republican nominees, Senator John McCain of Arizona and Mitt Romney, had received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm doing better than any Democrat'' in racking up military endorsements, she said. ''He's doing worse than any Republican.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With nine weeks until the election, a recent CNN/ORC poll shows Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has gained ground against Mrs. Clinton so that they are essentially tied nationally among likely voters. The poll found that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> held a 51 percent to 45 percent edge over Mrs. Clinton on the question of whom voters trust to handle terrorism, though she holds a solid lead on the issue of whom voters trust on foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The focus on national security came as President Obama's trip to Asia hit several diplomatic snags, intensifying Republican criticism of the White House's approach to foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton defended Mr. Obama's cool response after a heated dispute over the stairs he would use to depart from Air Force One when he arrived in Hangzhou, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, for the Group of 20 Summit meeting on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said if there had been the kerfuffle about the stairs and the press, he would have just stayed on the plane and gone home,'' she said, seeking to portray Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a petulant child, while citing her own dealings with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during her time at the State Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You don't get in a snit and stay on your plane and go home,'' she said. ''You get off the plane and you go to work.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama also canceled a planned meeting in Laos with President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines after Mr. Duterte used a slur to describe Mr. Obama. Mr. Duterte later apologized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Regarding the Philippines, Mrs. Clinton said, ''President Obama made exactly the right choice.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Monday, she accused Russian agencies of interfering in the United States election through cyberattacks that would help Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whose potential presidency, she said, would destabilize the United States and delight foreign adversaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton made Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seem uncaring about the United States military, pointing to his criticism of Khizr and Ghazala Khan, whose son was killed in Iraq, and she also faulted how his private enterprises had treated veterans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> companies have fired veterans because they have to take time off to fulfill their military commitments,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as Mrs. Clinton's tried to stoke fears in voters about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> preparedness to serve, it was Mr. Kaine who delivered the argument in personal terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Standing in front of 18 American flags at a former U.S.O. facility in Wilmington, N.C., Mr. Kaine talked about his son Nat, 26, a Marine deployed in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I trust Hillary Clinton to make these decisions with full knowledge that the life of my son and his friends may be riding on the outcome,'' Mr. Kaine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as commander in chief,'' he added, ''scares me to death.''</SPAN></P>
