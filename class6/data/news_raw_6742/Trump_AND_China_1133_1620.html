<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> held a news conference Wednesday morning during which he challenged Russia to find Hillary Clinton's missing email correspondence and made extensive comments about United States-Russian relations. Here are highlights of what he said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On allegations of Russian computer hacking and Mrs. Clinton's emails </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''By the way, they hacked -- they probably have her 33,000 emails. I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 emails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there. So let's see.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ...</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''And that's why -- if it is Russia, nobody even knows this, it's probably </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, or it could be somebody sitting in his bed. But it shows how weak we are, it shows how disrespected we are. Total -- assuming it's Russia or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or one of the major countries and competitors, it's a total sign of disrespect for our country. Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore and they certainly have no respect for our leader. So I know nothing about it. It's one of the most far-fetched I've ever heard.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  _____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On how he would approach the Russian president, Vladimir Putin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I would treat Vladimir Putin firmly but there's nothing that I can think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now so that we can go and knock out ISIS together with other people and with other countries. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with people, wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along, as an example, with Russia? I'm all for it and let's go get ISIS because we have to get ISIS and we have to get them fast.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  _____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On releasing his tax returns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It depends on the audit. It depends on the audit, not a big deal. By the way, just so you understand, I've released my papers, 104 pages of documents. I built an unbelievable company, tremendous cash, tremendous company with some of the great assets of the world. You've seen it. You were all very disappointed when you saw it actually but that's O.K. Far, far greater than anybody ever thought. I have a great company. I built an unbelievable company but if you look there you'll see there's nothing in Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''And as far as the tax returns, as soon as the audits complete, like any lawyer would tell you, Greta Van Susteren she was going over it a while ago, she's a lawyer. She said well no lawyer would let somebody release a tax return when they're under audit. It's a routine audit. I've gone through audits, which I think is very unfair, for 15 years. I have friends that are very rich and never get audited. I'm audited every year. Maybe that's because of politics, who knows.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  _____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Mr. Putin and Russia's alleged hacking of the Democratic National Committee email system</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Why do I have to get involved with Putin? I have nothing to do with Putin. I've never spoken to him. I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me. He doesn't respect our president. And if it is Russia -- which it's probably not, nobody knows who it is -- but if it is Russia, it's really bad for a different reason, because it shows how little respect they have for our country, when they would hack into a major party and get everything. But it would be interesting to see -- I will tell you this -- Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that happens. That'll be next. Yes, sir.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  _____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Putin's view of the United States and the presidential election</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I don't think he respects Clinton. I don't think Putin has any respect whatsoever for Clinton. I think he does respect me. And I hope I get along great with him. It's possible that we won't, Jeremy. I hope that we get along great with Putin because it would be great to have Russia with a good relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Right now, we don't have a good relationship. Putin has said things over the last year that are really bad things. O.K.? He mentioned the ''N'' word one time. I was shocked to hear him mention the ''N'' word. You know what the ''N'' word is, right? He mentioned it. I was shocked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He has a total lack of respect for President Obama. No. 1, he doesn't like him. And No. 2, he doesn't respect him. I think he's going to respect your president if I'm elected. And I hope he likes me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  _____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On his relations with Russia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''No, I have nothing to do with Russia, John. How many times do I have say that? Are you a smart man? I have nothing to with Russia, I have nothing to do with Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''And even -- for anything. What do I have to do with Russia? You know the closest I came to Russia, I bought a house a number of years ago in Palm Beach, Fla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Palm Beach is a very expensive place. There was a man who went bankrupt and I bought the house for $40 million and I sold it to a Russian for $100 million including brokerage commissions. So I sold it. So I bought it for 40, I told it for 100 to a Russian. That was a number of years ago. I guess probably I sell condos to Russians, O.K.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (QUESTION OFF-MIC)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Of course I can. I told you, other than normal stuff -- I buy a house if I sold it to a Russian. I have nothing to do with Russia. I said that Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama, but who doesn't know that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  _____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On asking Russia to hack servers in the United States</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''No, it gives me no pause. If they have them, they have them. We might as well -- hey, you know what gives me more pause? That a person in our government, crooked Hillary Clinton -- here's what gives me pause. Be quiet. I know you want to save her. That a person in our government, Katy, would delete or get rid of 33,000 emails. That gives me a big problem. After she gets a subpoena! She gets subpoenaed, and she gets rid of 33,000 emails? That gives me a problem. Now, if Russia or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or any other country has those emails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  _____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On business dealings with Russia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We wanted to; we were doing Miss Universe four or five years ago in Russia. It was a tremendous success. Very, very successful. And there were developers in Russia that wanted to put a lot of money into developments in Russia. And they wanted us to do it. But it never worked out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Frankly I didn't want to do it for a couple of different reasons. But we had a major developer, particular, but numerous developers that wanted to develop property in Moscow and other places. But we decided not to do it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  _____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On recognizing Crimea as a Russian territory</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We'll be looking at that. Yeah, we'll be looking.''</SPAN></P>
