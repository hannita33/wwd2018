<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With anxiety about the economy bubbling up on Wall Street and at campaign rallies around the country, the government reported on Friday that employers added 242,000 workers in February, a hefty increase that highlighted the labor market's steady gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We've got a real strong job market going,'' said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. ''It does suggest that fears about a U.S. recession have been greatly overdone.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Four years ago, at this point in the last presidential election cycle, the jobless rate was 8.3 percent and the economic recovery was in a relatively early stage. Then, worries centered on rising gas prices, deep consumer debt and government layoffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, the recovery is in its seventh year, the unemployment rate has dropped sharply to 4.9 percent and the private sector has chalked up 72 months of uninterrupted job gains, the longest streak on record. Oil prices may still be causing ulcers, but this time it is primarily producers who are feeling the pain, because prices have plunged.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The shadow on the otherwise positive Labor Department report was that wages fell 0.1 percent in February, a disappointment after January's  promising 0.5 percent increase. That put the yearly growth in wages at 2.2 percent, only modestly ahead of the inflation rate. The average length of the workweek declined by 0.2 hours last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite the setback on wages, Beth Ann Bovino, chief United States economist at Standard &amp; Poor's, was upbeat about the economy's prospects this year. ''We're back in the saddle again,'' she said, noting that the heavy snowfall that hit the Northeast last month apparently did little to curtail hiring in retail sales and food services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Given the slowdown in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and a herky-jerky stock market, Wall Street has been betting that the Federal Reserve will put off any interest rate increase at its next meeting later this month. William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, expressed caution this week, saying: ''I have marked down my growth outlook very modestly.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Economists said the Fed was still likely to remain in a holding pattern, but the strong jobs report would at least give its policy makers plenty to talk about and increased the chances that it would decide to raise borrowing costs in April or June. As Mr. Tannenbaum put it: ''This number will certainly spice up the Fed's discussion.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A broader measure that includes people too discouraged to search for work or who are making do with a part-time job because they cannot find a full-time one fell 0.2 of a percentage point, to 9.7 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Perhaps the most encouraging sign in the monthly statistics was evidence that people who had long been sidelined were being lured back to the job market. The overall share of Americans in the labor force ticked up 0.2 of a percentage point to 62.9 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That has been the shadow hanging over all the other labor force statistics,'' Patrick O'Keefe, director of economic policy at CohnReznick, an accounting, tax and advisory firm, said of the stubbornly low participation rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite the improved economic picture, there is still plenty of distress and anger, emotions that have helped spur the success of the Republican presidential front-runner, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and rallied many Democrats behind the underdog Bernie Sanders's attacks on inequality and Wall Street cronyism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Part of the reason is the unevenness of the recovery. Fortunes have diverged depending on where people live, their education and skill levels and what industry they work in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are seeing job growth across a range of industries, but we're also seeing a polarization in the labor market,'' said Tara Sinclair, chief economist for the job site Indeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There has been vigorous demand for hospitality and service workers, often at low wages. But the higher total job count masks losses in manufacturing, transportation, warehousing and energy, better-paying industries that tend to be dominated by blue-collar white men who have been particularly battered by shifts in the American economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mining industry, for example, continues to bleed jobs, with a loss of 19,000 in February, while manufacturing lost 16,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Working people in states like Michigan and Ohio feel the lousy manufacturing job loss and growing trade deficit with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, even if Wall Street and D.C. do not,'' Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said in a statement. ''If you're wondering why there's so much interest in political insurgencies among both Democrats and Republicans this year, here's your answer.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And while employment has been advancing at a robust pace for more than two years, many workers continue to complain about low pay, or jobs beneath their skill levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Why do we have this persistent gloom about the economy, when you have below-average unemployment rates?'' asked Neera Tanden, president of the left-leaning Center for American Progress. ''It is really a product of anxiety about what we call the middle-class squeeze, the ability of your income and wages to keep up with the staples of a middle-class life.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If you look at many </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> voters, they generally are people who have not been winning economically for a long time as the country is diversifying,'' Ms. Tanden said. Whites without a college education provide the core of support for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director and now president of the American Action Forum, a center-right policy research organization, agreed that stalled incomes were a persistent source of dissatisfaction. ''Getting wage growth up more rapidly is the key thing,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, if steady job growth continues and wages pick up in response to a tighter labor market, it could change views about the economy and influence the political dynamic. In previous elections, the direction of the economy in the months leading up to the vote has been perhaps the single most important factor affecting whether Americans opt for continuity or change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The brisk hiring since the Affordable Care Act went into effect also serves to undermine the Republican argument that the measure has stripped millions of jobs from the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Our businesses have created jobs every single month since I signed that 'job killing' Obamacare bill,'' for a total of 14.3 million private sector jobs, President Obama told reporters at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thomas E. Perez, the secretary of labor, underscored the point. ''There's an undeniable Eeyore caucus out there of fear-mongers and fact-deniers who want people to believe there is no job creation,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Certainly, the law is spurring job creation in the health care industry, with 38,000 jobs added in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Edward Fleischman, chief executive of the Execu/Search Group, a professional recruiting firm based in New York, said he had seen outsize demand for health care professionals, including urgent care physicians, nurses, therapists and technicians. ''A lot of that has to do with Obamacare,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Fleischman, whose firm opened three new offices last year, added that hiring -- particularly for digitally adept workers -- had been strong across the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Friday's report is the first of three estimates of February's job creation by the Labor Department. Revisions for December and January showed a total of 30,000 more jobs than previously reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  William Spriggs, chief economist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., contrasted the palpable dissatisfaction of many voters with the record of unbroken job creation. ''This is one of those times when the economic cycle has hit a weird political cycle,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
