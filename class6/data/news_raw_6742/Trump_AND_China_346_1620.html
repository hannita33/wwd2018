<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's how we analyzed the Republican debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_______ </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  MIAMI -- The four candidates still battling for the Republican nomination for president gathered at the University of Miami for the party's 12th debate, hosted by CNN. Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leads in both delegates and states won, with Gov. John Kasich's home state, Ohio, and Senator Marco Rubio's home state, Florida, both heading to the polls on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   In a surprise twist, the first question, on jobs and the economy, goes to Mr. Kasich. Asked by Jake Tapper, the debate moderator, if his advocacy for trade deals had come at the ''expense of the middle class,'' Mr. Kasich cited his blue-collar background -- his father was a mailman and his family worked in the steel industry -- and said he believes in ''free trade, but fair trade.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Mr. Rubio -- who supports increasing the number of H-1B visas for high-skilled workers -- was asked about the case of Disney, which used a loophole in the program to lay off American workers and replace them with foreign workers. Companies like Disney that abuse the program, he said, ''should be barred from using it in the future.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   On the question of visas for high-skilled workers, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seemed to try to have it both ways. As a businessman, he said, he uses the program and ''I do what I have to do.'' But, he added, it's ''unfair'' for workers -- ''And we should end it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Senator Ted Cruz of Texas used the H-1B question to switch to the issue of illegal immigration, a hot topic for the Republican base. He said he would cut federal funds to ''sanctuary cities'' that don't follow the nation's immigration laws. And, he added, Democrats don't have the political will to fix the nation's broken immigration system, because they ''view those illegal immigrants as potential voters.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   And the mystery of just why Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is holding a news conference at Mar-a-Lago, his private club, on Friday morning became clear midway through the first hour, when Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declared that Ben Carson, the retired pediatric neurosurgeon, would be endorsing him. He will make sure Mr. Carson will be very involved in his education policies, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   ''First of all, Ted was in favor of amnesty,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. ''There's no question about that.'' In any other debate, those would have been fighting words. But none of the candidates have really had a highly heated exchange yet. As Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> himself said, just moments later, ''I cannot believe how civil it's been up here.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Mr. Cruz and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did get into a brief back-and-forth over Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> threat to impose a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called it a ''threat'' that would become a tax only if foreign countries, like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, ''don't behave.'' Mr. Cruz countered that ''it's not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who pays the tax,'' but the ''working men and women'' here in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not so, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> argued, explaining that he would ''start building those factories and those plants here instead of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' thus creating more jobs. And then it was time for a commercial break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Asked about his recent comments that ''Islam hates us,'' and if he really meant all Muslims, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doubled down: '' I mean a lot of them, I mean a lot of them,'' he said. ''There's tremendous hatred, and I will stick with exactly what I said.'' He is not willing to be politically correct, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm not interested in being politically correct -- I'm interested in being correct,'' Mr. Rubio retorted, saying the nation would need to work with Muslim countries to help defeat radical extremism. Mr. Kasich, similarly, said that the United States would need Muslim and Arab countries to fight the Islamic State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   On an issue that has dogged Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in recent weeks -- his calls for violating international law and targeting the families of suspected terrorists -- the New York billionaire called on existing laws to be expanded in order to fight terrorists on ''equal footing.'' Both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio, meanwhile, quickly and firmly said they would not target the families of terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that he would be a strong supporter of Israel, citing a somewhat unlikely list of credentials: his Jewish son-in-law, his daughter Ivanka who converted to Judaism, and his Jewish grandchildren. He also mentioned that he had served as the grand marshal of the Israeli Day Parade down Fifth Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also added that a peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians would be a tough negotiation. But, he said, ''I'd like to give it a shot.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Asked about his comments seeming to praise authoritarian governments -- calling both President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government during the Tiananmen Square massacre ''strong'' -- Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that ''strong doesn't mean good,'' adding that he was not endorsing the massacre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Putin is a strong leader, absolutely,'' he said. ''I don't say that in a good way or a bad way. I say that as a fact.'' Mr. Kasich, asked a follow-up question, was swift in his rebuke: ''I think the Chinese government butchered those kids,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Does Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> share some culpability for encouraging the hostile tone at his rallies, which in recent weeks have turned increasing violent, Mr. Tapper asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I hope not, I truly hope not,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. But, he said, when his supporters see protesters, when ''they see what's going on in this country, they have anger that's unbelievable.'' And, he added, ''We have some protesters who are bad dudes'' and are ''really dangerous.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   ''There are only two of us who have a path to winning the nomination -- Donald and myself,'' Mr. Cruz said, responding to a question about the possibility of a brokered convention, and noting that he has finished ahead of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in eight states. He then appealed to voters, saying that if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the nominee, Hillary Clinton will win in November and urging, ''Come and join us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also returned to the numbers. What Mr. Cruz doesn't mention, he said, is that he has actually beaten Mr. Cruz far more frequently -- in 13 states.</SPAN></P>
