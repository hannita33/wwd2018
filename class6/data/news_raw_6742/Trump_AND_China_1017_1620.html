<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton called Friday for rethinking President Obama's strategy to combat North Korea's nuclear program, saying the country's latest nuclear test gave the White House ''an opening'' to expand sanctions and broaden a missile-defense program in neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also said that the United States can do more to pressure </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to lean on North Korea, its longtime ally, to halt its program. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's clear that the increasing threat posed by North Korea requires not only a rethinking of the strategy, but an urgent effort to convince the neighbors, most particularly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that this is not just a U.S. issue,'' Mrs. Clinton said, signaling she would support a change in strategy since she served as secretary of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since the start of the Obama administration, Mrs. Clinton had supported Mr. Obama on his ''strategic patience'' approach of gradually escalating sanctions on North Korea, but the blast on Friday signaled that the tactic had failed to halt North Korean advances in developing its nuclear capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Friday, Mrs. Clinton convened a bipartisan group of foreign policy advisers in New York, including the former Homeland Security secretaries Michael Chertoff and Janet Napolitano, and David H. Petraeus, the former director of the C.I.A., to discuss the fight to combat the Islamic State and stop homegrown terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the news of North Korea's latest test quickly shifted the conversation to Asia and, specifically, relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think we have an opening here that we haven't had for the last seven years,'' Mrs. Clinton told reporters at the New-York Historical Society after the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The missile defense system that the United States is planning with South Korea, she said, ''is not something that the North Koreans or the Chinese or the Russians in the region are particularly pleased about -- but what is the alternative?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama has resisted imposing a full embargo against North Korea, which could provoke a deeper conflict. But Mrs. Clinton said sanctions alone were not enough, pointing to the advances in nuclear technology made by Iran despite sanctions. ''They were able to acquire and put into operation a significant number of centrifuges,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But, she added, tightening existing sanctions was one essential step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There's lot more we can do,'' she said, ''And it will be on the top of my list in dealing with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in how we are going to prevent what could very well be a serious conflict with North Korea.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the news conference concluded and Mrs. Clinton started to exit, a reporter yelled out for her opinion on Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appearance on Russian television. Mrs. Clinton grinned and made her way back to the podium, eager to speak on the topic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This just becomes more and more of a reality television show,'' she said. ''It's not a serious presidential campaign.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also addressed the North Korean nuclear blast, laying the blame for North Korea's behavior squarely at the feet of Mrs. Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Just today, it was announced that North Korea performed its fifth nuclear test -- its fourth since Hillary Clinton became secretary of state,'' he told a meeting of the Family Research Council in Washington. ''It's just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state. Failed at everything.''</SPAN></P>
