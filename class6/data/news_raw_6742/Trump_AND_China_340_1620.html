<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HONG KONG -- Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has irritated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> even before taking office as president, with criticism of the country's trade and currency practices and an unexpected phone call with the president of Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a few hours on Tuesday, it looked to some as if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had struck back. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Data services widely available to the public showed that the country's currency, the renminbi, had been sharply devalued as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> slept.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such a move would roil global markets and drastically escalate economic tensions between Beijing and the incoming administration. And because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tightly controls the value of its currency, such a sharp and sudden move would be no accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But no deliberate devaluation took place. Instead, the culprit was a technical problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Concerns are already high that slowing economic growth and persistent capital outflows are putting pressure on Beijing to let its currency weaken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The renminbi mainly trades onshore in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during normal business hours -- and it does not trade overnight, when the supposedly big devaluation took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thanks, https://t.co/1w0y2MTwlY! That was an exciting morning. For future reference, the CNY doesn't trade overnight. pic.twitter.com/JcnktzkwAD -- Neil Gough (@n_gough) December 6, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A basic Google search -- and data published by XE.com, one of the world's most popular currency websites -- appeared to show early Tuesday that the renminbi had suddenly fallen more than 8 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The data quickly drew attention from the news media. At a published value of around 7.48 per dollar, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> currency looked to have retreated in a flash to its weakest level since 2007.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both Google Finance and XE appear to have used erroneous data. It was unclear what pricing sources were in play, but on Monday, ICAP, a foreign currency broker based in London, published errant quotes for renminbi-to-dollar exchange rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Detailed price data carried by Bloomberg and Reuters showed ICAP on Tuesday morning as quoting the renminbi at higher than 7.4 per dollar. The actual market rate at the time was about 6.86 per dollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Not a tradable price,'' said Stephen Innes, a senior currency trader at Oanda in Singapore, said of the conspicuously weak renminbi rate. ''It looks like little more than an error.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  XE updated its data after several hours to remove the anomalous quotes, and by late afternoon in Asia, Google had, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We have a wide array of upstream data sources, several of which provided rates which our algorithms interpreted as a genuine movement'' in the renminbi, XE said in a statement. ''We have confirmed with our upstream providers that these were inaccurate and have adjusted our rates accordingly.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Google declined to comment, and ICAP did not respond to requests for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The related rates for offshore renminbi, which trades around the clock, were unfazed on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Errant price quotes are not unheard-of in financial markets. A snag last month caused Google and XE to sharply overvalue the Bahraini dinar to the dollar, prompting corrections and an apology from XE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Slowing economic growth is adding to expectations that the renminbi will weaken, prompting Beijing to clamp down on persistent capital outflows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> frequent criticisms of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> currency policies -- despite being outdated or sometimes incorrect -- have heightened concerns about the value of the renminbi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over the weekend, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> departed from American policy by taking a phone call from Taiwan's president, a measure that could signal he intends to broadly redefine his nation's relationship with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took to Twitter on Sunday to reiterate his criticism of Beijing's currency policy, saying: ''Did </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Did </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into.. -- Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hours later, the seemingly sudden drop in the renminbi appeared to some like a direct retaliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What is interesting is how plausible the world found this scenario, like just waiting for the shoe to drop,'' said Christopher Balding, an associate professor of finance at the Peking University HSBC School of Business in Shenzhen, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Balding cited the downward pressures that have been building on the Chinese currency in the face of outflows, as citizens and companies rush to get their renminbi offshore and convert it into more international currencies, like the dollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> just exacerbates all these things, raising the nervousness of an already jittery situation,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
