</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good evening. Here's the latest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. It was a remarkable moment in the American-Israeli relationship, and for Secretary of State John Kerry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 23 days left in office, Mr. Kerry dropped diplomatic niceties and harshly criticized Israel over settlements, arguing that they imperil the two-state solution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is blaming the United States for orchestrating last week's Security Council resolution condemning the settlements. The United States denies doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kerry appears to have concluded there is nothing left to lose, and he spoke knowing the new administration may well abandon long-held American negotiating positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Nearly 200 Homeland Security employees and contractors have accepted almost $15 million in bribes to let immigrants and drugs into the country over the last decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was our finding after a review of thousands of court records and internal agency documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The employees sold green cards, gave sensitive information to drug cartels and looked the other way as drugs and people crossed the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Women who took fish oil during the last three months of pregnancy significantly lowered the risk that their children would develop asthma, a new study found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the researchers say the study should be replicated before doctors recommend that pregnant women routinely take fish oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors are eager to find ways to prevent the chronic disease, which is on the rise in developed countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A wild Christmas Party at a beach in Sydney, Australia, drew more than 10,000 people who left behind 16 tons of trash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The huge mess prompted officials to ban alcohol at the beach for the remainder of the Australian summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By late evening, it got so bad that we let the shark alarm off three times to try to get the swimmers out of the water,&quot; said a community patrolman. &quot;They were all intoxicated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Each December, predictions of next year's hottest food items barrel forth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're hearing jackfruit, sorghum and harissa are about to have their moment. And don't ignore horseradish, spirulina and Asian-inspired breakfasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a look at food trends over the last 20 years (remember bubble tea? So 2002) and a deeper exploration of the dark and often dubious work of food-trend forecasting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promise to impose high tariffs on American companies that manufacture goods abroad could take aim at his own brand, and his daughter's as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> apparel on sale at Saks Off Fifth in New York on a recent visit was made in Indonesia, Vietnam or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower, a cap made in Bangladesh was on sale for $35.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Tributes continue to pour in for Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia in &quot;Star Wars.&quot; She died Tuesday at age 60.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our film critic remembers Ms. Fisher for changing a popular understanding of female heroism, calling her the &quot;foremother of Hermione Granger and Katniss Everdeen and of countless latter-day Disney princesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And many fans remembered Ms. Fisher, who was candid about her struggles with bipolar disorder, by speaking out on Twitter about their experiences with mental illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Fentanyl has surpassed heroin to become the deadliest drug on Long Island, where the number of fatalities are part of a national pattern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The synthetic opioid is often prescribed to cancer patients and can be 100 times more potent than morphine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's essentially the serial killer of drugs,&quot; said one addiction counselor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Among our best-read articles today: The Marine Corps taught one recruit how to kill, but not how to come home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our deep dive looks at the case of a young marksman who landed in prison after he returned from Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was so drunk, he didn't remember the violent act that landed him there. His lawyers' strategy of using PTSD and alcoholism as a defense initially failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Finally, a proposal for a new kind of New Year's resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our tech experts say you should be focusing on a different kind of fitness in 2017: your tech fitness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are your passwords outdated? Or worse, are your devices not password-protected? Where are you storing old devices? Are your batteries optimized?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The time is now to clean up and cast out - in an environmentally friendly manner, of course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
