</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're trying something new for our readers in Asia and the Pacific region: a morning briefing to jump-start your day. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do you like? What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at asiabriefing@nytimes.com.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is facing backlash over his choiceof Stephen K. Bannon as his administration's chief strategist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move elevates the hard-right nationalist movement Mr. Bannon nurtured while running Breitbart News, a website whose staples include articles linking migrants to the spread of disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bannon said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> followers are patriots who are being tarred by the existence of racists and anti-Semites &quot;on the margins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of racially charged assaults, graffiti attacks and other episodes have surged since Election Day, and the F.B.I. said that hate crimes rose 7 percent last year, driven by a rise in attacks against American Muslims. Many attacks have also been countered by acts of public support and solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Obama took questions from reporters for the first time since the election, portraying Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as apragmatist and stressing the importance of a peaceful transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without copping out, I think it's fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to comment&quot; on the choice of Mr. Bannon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obamais about to fly to Greece, at the start of a final international tour that will also take him to Germany and Peru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will try to soothe fears of the coming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency, but his leverage has been diminished and his legacy bruised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continued to project his presidency onto the world stage. He spoke with Xi Jinping of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia has embraced Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election. The State Duma, or parliament, broke into applause on news of his victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has threatened to confront </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on a range of trade issues, promised Mr. Xi that the two nations would have &quot;one of the strongest relationships.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hong Kong's High Court ruled that two pro-independence politicians who were elected to the legislature cannot taketheir seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixtus Leung, 30, known as Baggio, and Yau Wai-ching, 25, set off the conflict by usingwhat some consider a derogatoryterm for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when they took their oaths of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beijing reacted by issuing a new interpretation of Hong Kong's Basic Law, challenging the territory's semiautonomous status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Criminal Court is considering a war-crimes investigation in Afghanistan, after a prosecutor said she had a &quot;reasonable basis to believe&quot; that American soldiers there committed war crimes, including torture.<BR><BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Samsung is spending $8 billion to acquire Harman International Industries, an American company best known for high-end car stereos, like Harman/Kardon and JBL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal gives Samsung a stake in so-called connected cars, which could mean a boom in screens, computers and connectivity. Its stock rose 25.6 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japan's G.D.P. figures surprised analysts with strong economic growth in the third quarter despite declining consumer prices and deflation. Our analyst looks at whether the trend will last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Geographic Channel has reinvented itself under the leadership of James Murdoch at its parent, 21st Century Fox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the makeover is a shift to big-ticket shows like &quot;Mars,&quot; a new mini-series co-produced by Ron Howard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. markets closed lower, and oil was down. Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Malaysian lawmaker was given 18 months in prison for disclosing classified information from an official audit of a scandal-plagued investment fund linked to Prime Minister Najib Razak. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Shanghai-based venture capitalist Eric Li argues that relations between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the U.S. may suffer over trade, but could improve if the U.S. stops trying to remake the world in its own image. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, was questioned in London about a rape accusation in Sweden in 2010. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Rodrigo Duterte said that if Islamic State militants came to the Philippines, he would not let his &quot;people be slaughtered for the sake of human rights.&quot; [Reuters]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japan's government plans to increase medical checkups for older drivers after a wave of fatal traffic accidents. [Asahi Shimbun]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If all the railways projects proposed for Southeast Asia were built, here is a map of how the region would look. [The Diplomat]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Canada's government is under scrutiny for blocking an arms deal with Thailand over factors including human rights abuses, just months after exporting $15 billion in combat vehicles to Saudi Arabia, which has a poorer rights record. [Globe and Mail]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nationalist resurgence is on display in &quot;The Long March,&quot; above, a new opera about the early days of the Communist Party. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gwen Ifill, an award-winning television journalist who moderated vice-presidential debates in 2004 and 2008, died of cancer in Washington. She was 61.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Pizza, the polar bear used to lure shoppers to a mall in southern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, will be temporarily moved while his air-conditioned enclosure is &quot;optimized and upgraded.&quot; Animal rights groups say the move doesn't go nearly far enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Chinese astronauts expect to leave their space lab this week, after a monthlong stay that is a first for their nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has poured billions of dollars into its space program, aiming to rival the United States and Russia in reaching Mars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such programs are enormous drivers of technological innovation. So it might come as a surprise to know that space communications rely on an old standby: radio waves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speech from an astronaut, video from cameras and data from sensors flow into a transmitter, which emits radio waves picked up by a terrestrial receiver. Terrestrial transmitters reverse the favor. The same basic technology sends music to your radio, YouTube videos to your cellphone and photos from Pluto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There really isn't any alternative until we figure out how to use lasers to convey data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's been a lot of fine-tuning of radio capabilities over the 125 years or so that scientists have been playing with electromagnetic radiation. We have great antennas and efficient, secure encoding now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the technology is also good for a simple call from home. Last week, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, Xi Jinping, called the space lab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone across </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cares very much about both of you,&quot; Mr. Xi said. One astronaut proudly said, &quot;I will go forth, and successfully complete the mission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
