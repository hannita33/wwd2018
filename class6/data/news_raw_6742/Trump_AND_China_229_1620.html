<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TOKYO -- Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, did not take long to recover from the shock of Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory. By Thursday morning -- Wednesday night in the United States -- Mr. Abe had called the president-elect and arranged to meet him in New York next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In hustling to be one of the first world leaders to meet with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since the election, Mr. Abe is seeking to gauge the sincerity of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign rhetoric on Japan. As a candidate, he repeatedly excoriated the country, along with other American allies, for not paying what he called its fair share to support American military bases, and he suggested he might withdraw troops unless Japan agreed to pay more. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Abe will also probably want to discuss the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal between the United States and several Asian countries, including Japan, that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he would consign to the dustbin. The Abe administration considers the pact, which moved closer to ratification on Thursday with approval in Japan's lower house of Parliament, an important plank in his economic policy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election stunned the Japanese establishment, which, like many people in the United States and around the globe, had expected Hillary Clinton to take the White House. As recently as late last week, government officials leaked to the Japanese news media that Mr. Abe was planning a visit to Washington in February -- to meet with Mrs. Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The surprise result had the prime minister's advisers scrambling Wednesday night to develop briefing books for him on scenarios they had assumed were moot. Japan has grown accustomed to a friendly relationship with the United States, and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign criticisms have unsettled officials who wonder whether they can still count on the country's most important ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In their call on Thursday, Mr. Abe told Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that ''a strong Japan-U.S. alliance is an indispensable presence that supports peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,'' according to Koichi Hagiuda, a deputy chief cabinet secretary. Mr. Hagiuda said the two leaders did not discuss the trade deal or Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> calls for Japan to shoulder more of the cost of hosting United States forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is not clear whether Mr. Abe will push to discuss such specifics in his meeting with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, scheduled for next Thursday, when the prime minister will be in New York on his way to Peru for a forum on economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. But he will certainly look to begin the diplomatic dance of persuading Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to back away from some of his harshest rhetoric on those issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Abe will seek to develop a personal relationship with the president-elect -- a connection that might not come so naturally, given Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> maverick personality and lack of diplomatic experience and Mr. Abe's long career as an establishment politician. This is Mr. Abe's second tenure as prime minister, and his grandfather held the post decades ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's really hard to imagine a political blue blood like Abe establishing a warm rapport with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' said Jeffrey Kingston, the director of Asian studies at Temple University's campus in Tokyo. ''But it's sort of like your family. He's inherited the U.S. as an ally, so he's going to have to develop a working relationship.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Japan, much is riding on the bond between the two countries. Although Japan has its own military, it counts on American forces -- which have been based here since the occupation after World War II -- to help protect it from threats from surrounding countries, an obligation the United States is bound by treaty to fulfill. Japan pays about $1.8 billion toward the cost of hosting American troops on the island of Okinawa and elsewhere around Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rising tensions in Asia have made the alliance particularly vital for Japan. North Korea's tests of atomic weapons, and repeated incursions by Chinese vessels into disputed waters surrounding a group of Japanese-controlled islands in the East </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, have unnerved the Japanese. Mr. Abe has long sought to bolster Japan's own military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Japan completely relies on the United States for nuclear deterrence; while Japan is the only country where atomic bombs have ever been used in war, it does not have nuclear weapons. During the campaign, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggested several times that Japan, along with its neighbor and fellow American ally South Korea, should develop and pay for its own nuclear arsenal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview that aired Thursday on NHK, Japan's public broadcaster, Maj. Gen. Bert K. Mizusawa, who was recently named one of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advisers, said that as a businessman, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> regarded treaties with other countries as contracts that needed to be reviewed to see whether they benefited Americans. Mr. Mizusawa added that the so-called nuclear umbrella that the United States provides to Japan and South Korea is costly, and he suggested that North Korea's increasing threat would make it even costlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Abe is unlikely to broach the nuclear topic directly with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> next week. Antinuclear sentiment is strong in Japan, which was struck in 2011 by an earthquake and tsunami that crippled a nuclear power plant in Fukushima; any effort to develop nuclear weapons would face a severe domestic backlash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  South Korea's president, Park Geun-hye, also reached out to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Thursday with a 10-minute congratulatory call, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong sanctions and pressure against North Korea. A statement from Ms. Park's office said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had assured her that he agreed ''100 percent.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are with you all the way, and we will not waver,'' the statement quoted him as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For South Korea and Japan, perhaps more worrying than any immediate action Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might take is the action he might not take. Analysts here said they worried that Asia, after being the focus of a ''pivot'' by President Obama, would fall down the list of American foreign policy priorities, leaving a vacuum into which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might rush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We should be aware that the U.S. will pay less attention to Asia,'' Nikkei Shimbun, a Japanese financial newspaper, wrote in an editorial on Thursday. ''During the transitional period, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could make a new move in the South or East </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. The Japanese government needs to be ready for such a situation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since the election, many analysts have appeared on Japanese talk shows to discuss the effect of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency. But as elsewhere, much of the talk is based on speculation about how literally to take Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign pledges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's not quite healthy to draw any conclusion from what he has said,'' said Yoshiki Mine, a former official with the Foreign Ministry in Japan and now head of the Institute of Peaceful Diplomacy, a research organization. ''We have to wait to see whether he will get good briefings or whether he is flexible enough to look at things more squarely.''</SPAN></P>
