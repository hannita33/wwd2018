<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidential race began to shift in earnest to the industrial Midwest on Friday, with pivotal contests looming in Michigan, Ohio and Illinois, and Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Hillary Clinton crossing each other's paths in a preview of what the general election could hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The region is one where Mrs. Clinton performed quite well in the Democratic primaries in 2008, beating Barack Obama in Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania (Mr. Obama did not compete in Michigan.) And when she visits a manufacturing center in Detroit on Friday, she plans to reveal a job-creation and wage-growth program, according to her campaign. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the region -- especially Michigan, which holds its primary on Tuesday -- has been more welcoming to Republicans lately as its manufacturing-based economy has suffered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with his pointed messages about punishing American companies that send jobs overseas and taking an aggressive stance against countries like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that devalue their currency, is also finding an audience. The New York businessman holds a 10-point lead over his closest competitors in Michigan's Republican primary, according to a poll released this week by The Detroit Free Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> greeted a crowd in Warren, Mich., on Friday morning to raucous chants of ''Build the wall!'' and insisted, in an echo of his campaign slogan, that he would restore greatness to the American auto industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is car country -- rapidly not becoming car country, but we're going to keep it car country,'' he said, imploring the crowd to vote for him on Tuesday. ''Mexico is becoming the car capital of the world, whether you like it or not,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If you get laid off on Tuesday I still want your vote,'' he added. ''I'll get you a new job, don't worry about it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton was set to speak in Detroit, not far away from where Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeared on Friday morning. Later, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was heading to the northern tip of the state, more conservative territory, for another event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Michigan, Illinois and Ohio vote on March 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the Republican side, Ohio awards the primary winner all of its 66 delegates, making it a contest with considerable influence. John R. Kasich, the Ohio governor, had been strongly favored to win -- so much so that Senator Marco Rubio decided to essentially abandon the state and refocus his efforts on Florida, which votes the same day and also awards its 99 delegates in a winner-take-all fashion. But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has recently been gaining in polls in Ohio, edging ahead of the governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fallout from the Republican debate the night before continued on Friday as Republicans absorbed the hostile and often crude tenor of the shout-fest, which kicked off with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> assuring a national audience that his manhood was of adequate size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is a new low in presidential politics,'' said Mitt Romney, who on Thursday denounced Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as dangerous and dishonest in an plea to Republicans to band together to stop the party's front-runner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even Us Weekly, the entertainment magazine and website, weighed in. In an article about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reference to his anatomy, it captured some Twitter reaction that seemed to sum up the general sense of revulsion. ''I wanna die,'' the article quoted a Twitter commenter as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokesman for Mr. Rubio said in an interview with CNN on Friday that the debate had descended to the point that he sent his 6-year-old son out of the room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rubio, speaking to voters in Topeka, Kan., on Friday morning, seemed somewhat contrite about the ugly turn the debate took. ''I'm not here to attack anyone,'' he said. ''We did plenty of that last night, I suppose.''</SPAN></P>
