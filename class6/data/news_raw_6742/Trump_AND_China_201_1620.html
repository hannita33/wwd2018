<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- The Chinese state news media lashed out at Rex W. Tillerson, President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nominee for secretary of state, on Friday, warning that his call to deny </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> access to islands it has constructed in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea could provoke a conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Tillerson said during a confirmation hearing this week before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> efforts to build islands in the sea and to equip some with military equipment were illegal, and he drew comparisons to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State-run news outlets in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> angrily denounced Mr. Tillerson's remarks on Friday, vowing to counter any effort by the United States to intervene in the strategically significant waterway, which Beijing argues has been its territory since ancient times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Global Times, a newspaper that often adopts a nationalistic tone, warned in an editorial that the United States might be forced to wage a ''large-scale war'' if it tried to block </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has enough determination and strength to make sure that his rabble-rousing will not succeed,'' the editorial said, referring to Mr. Tillerson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daily, a state-run, English-language newspaper, said in an editorial that the nominee's remarks were ''not worth taking seriously because they are a mishmash of na&iuml;vet&eacute;, shortsightedness, worn-out prejudices and unrealistic political fantasies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Should he act on them in the real world, it would be disastrous,'' the editorial continued. ''It would set a course for devastating confrontation between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the U.S.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The angry reaction to Mr. Tillerson's remarks reflected the degree to which Chinese leaders see the island-building campaign as a matter of national sovereignty and a crucial part of efforts to become a global military superpower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the response also suggested that Chinese officials seek to stake out a tough position as they prepare to deal with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has criticized Chinese policies on trade and North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is looking to heighten the threat of conflict,'' said Anders Corr, principal of Corr Analytics, a research organization based in New York. ''They're basically doing that to try to intimidate U.S. political and economic actors, and influence their decision making around issues like Taiwan and the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Corr added that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his cabinet nominees, through their harsh words, also sought a strong hand in negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, many analysts in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reacted with alarm to the remarks by Mr. Tillerson, who recently stepped down as chief executive of Exxon Mobil. He said that the United States would need to ''send </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops.'' He added, referring to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, ''Your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over the past several years, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has dredged sand to turn scattered South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea reefs and atolls into islands -- totaling roughly 3,000 acres -- despite protests from neighbors and from the United States. An international tribunal invalidated many of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> claims in the sea last year, but Chinese leaders have pressed forward with construction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Obama administration has dispatched warships near the artificial islands, in what it calls an attempt to uphold freedom of navigation in the sea, an important economic and strategic waterway that is believed to be rich in oil and gas. But American officials have so far stopped short of threatening to block </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> access to the islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Carlyle A. Thayer, an emeritus professor of politics at the University of New South Wales in Australia, said that such a move would be akin to President John F. Kennedy's ordering a blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Tillerson's proposal would provoke a serious confrontation that could quickly develop into armed conflict,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some Chinese analysts said Mr. Tillerson's remarks were an indication that the United States would continue to seek a robust presence in Asia, despite Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pledges to focus on domestic issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Su Hao, a professor at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign Affairs University in Beijing, said that such a move by Washington would draw resistance from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other nations in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will not adjust its policy regarding the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea,'' Mr. Su said in a telephone interview. ''We will continue to do things that are in line with our own national interests and our own logic.''</SPAN></P>
