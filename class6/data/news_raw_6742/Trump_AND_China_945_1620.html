</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are the top 10 comments of the week on our digital platforms, as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women Say Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Groped Them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. I'm an 18-year-old college freshman, and in February I attended the Republican debate at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire with my AP Government and Politics class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I went up to the stage during a commercial break and shook hands with several candidates. When I put my hand out to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in a fashion that very clearly intended a handshake, he reached past my hand and touched my cheek, saying, &quot;So beautiful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was disturbing and inappropriate, especially since I was obviously a student. (I was surrounded by a group of my peers and do not look particularly old for my age.) I was in shock and I didn't say anything, but I regret not standing up to him for that small but unacceptable act.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Madeline in Minnesota, reacting to an article about two women who told The New York Times that Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had touched them inappropriately.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This comment received more than 5,300 reader recommendations, the most of any comment this week, and more than 70 reader responses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a woman in corporate America I have seen so much abuse of power just like this. Frequently women are blamed for these incidents while the men retain, and even gain, respect, admiration and even more power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an illness in our society that will not be easily cured. It is persistent and pervasive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, we now have legislation, training, hotlines and HR departments on the lookout for this kind of behavior. But the reality is that today's workplace is not so different from that which these women experienced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two women are brave to come forward and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude. What we are witnessing right now is history in the making - these women pushing through the lies and excuses to say, &quot;This is real, and it happened to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Fay in California. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where were all of these alleged sex abuse victims during </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> television career, during the primaries, or any time during the time period that any actual civil or criminal charges could have been filed against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one with a brain believes in this day and age that women are defenseless pawns of men - in fact to continue to perpetuate this myth about women is in and of itself denigrating of the strength of modern women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These allegations are transparent attempts to distract voters from the actual issues in this election - taxes and income inequality, border and homeland security, the dangerous instability in the Middle East, and other important issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contents of [Hillary Clinton's] emails are infinitely more important to the fitness of the candidates than any of the sexual comments and alleged sexual behavior of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - John Q. Public in Los Angeles. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This comment received more than 40 reader responses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bob Dylan Wins the Nobel Prize in Literature</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I started listening to Dylan in 1964. I was 13 or 14. It wasn't the so-called protest songs that impressed me the most. It was the songs about relationships, both loving and revengeful, that got me hooked: &quot;She Belongs to Me,&quot; &quot;Love Minus Zero No Limit,&quot; &quot;Visions of Johanna,&quot; &quot;Idiot Wind&quot; and more recently, &quot;Girl From the Red River Shore&quot; and so many others thru the decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Love songs are probably one of our oldest forms of literature, and it's high time Bob was recognized like this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - R.F. in Shelburne Falls, Mass., reacting to an article about Bob Dylan receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This comment received more than 230 reader recommendations.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I'm sorry, but this is a slap in the face to literary writers everywhere, many of whom toil in relative obscurity all their lives, and some of whom literally risk their lives to write and publish their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can see now why the Nobel committee took an extra week to announce this decision - likely some members vehemently disagreed with the choice. I would've been one of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dylan is already a millionaire many times over, so he doesn't need the money, and you can't argue that his work needs the spotlight the Nobel shines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has he been an important influence on American poetry? Nope. (Music, sure, but not poetry, per se.) Are there better poets in the world, even in America? You bet. And today they are feeling something the Nobel Prize in Literature should never cause: discouragement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - G. in New York. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This comment received more than 300 reader recommendations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Go Back to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A large segment of the white population feels deeply uncomfortable with the demographic shift that has been, quite frankly, shoved down their throats. When the floodgates to immigration were opened in the '60s, they were promised that the very essence of their country will not change. But it did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, you could walk in some parts of the U.S. and not hear or read a single word of English. They, perhaps rightly, feel angry and frustrated by that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does that justify verbally assaulting your family? Nope, not in a million years. But I think it provides context to the tribalism we all feel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - James in New York, reacting to a first-person article by a Times editor, Michael Luo. Mr. Luo, an Asian-American born in the United States, wrote of his encounter with a woman who yelled at his family to &quot;go back to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This comment received more than 250 reader recommendations and more than 80 reader responses. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am first-generation American born of immigrants. But no one ever tells me to go back to where I came from. You see, I am Swedish-American, tall, blonde, and blue eyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My father, with his Swedish accent, never once was told to go back to Sweden. So, it's not really immigration, is it? It's racism through and through - and a pox on America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Lilla Victoria in Grosse Pointe, Mich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This comment received more than 1,900 reader recommendations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thai King Dies After 7-Decade Reign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Grieving with Thailand. I moved to Thailand at age 10 and I grew up respecting and admiring the King. He was benevolent, kind, always serving, generous, ambitious and caring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I grew up knowing and believing, because of his great example, that leaders can be respected role models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Tessa Lyn Shockey on The Times's Facebook page, reacting to an article about the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, who died Thursday at 88. He reigned for 70 years.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teenager Skews Presidential Polls</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is inspiring: You see, kids, one person CAN make a difference!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Ed in Old Field, N.Y., reacting to an article about a 19-year-old African-American man from Illinois whose support for Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a presidential poll has made that poll an outlier. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This comment received more than 390 reader recommendations.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Bone's Sweater</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Red Izod quarter-zip bought to see &quot;Phantom of the Opera.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worn again at the most unbelievable Presidential debate in history to cover ripped pants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of early 21st-century U.S. sociological commentary summarized in a single garment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Lane Packwood on The Times's Facebook page, responding to an article about the red Izod sweater worn by Ken Bone, who asked the candidates a question at Sunday's presidential debate and became an internet sensation. The sweater sold out in several locations.  </SPAN></P>
