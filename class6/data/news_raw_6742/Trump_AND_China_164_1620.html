<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAVOS, Switzerland -- For the investors and market-movers at the annual World Economic Forum here, a threat lurks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At cocktail parties where the Champagne flows, financiers have expressed bewilderment over the rise of populist groups that are feeding a backlash against globalization. In the halls of the Davos Congress Center, where many of the meetings this week are taking place, investors have tried to make sense of the political upheaval. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The world order has been upended. As the United States retreats from the promise of free trade, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is taking up the mantle. The stark shift leaves investors trying to assess the new risk and opportunities in the global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is the first time there is absolutely no consensus,'' said William F. Browder, a co-founder of Hermitage Capital Management who has been coming to Davos for 21 years. ''Everyone is looking into the abyss.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fear of the Populist 'Threat'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The religion of the global elite -- free trade and open markets -- is under attack, and there has been a lot of hand-wringing over what Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund has declared a ''middle-class crisis.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But while all attendees in Davos have a view on the state of the world, there is little agreement on how to deal with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The biggest concern? Finding a way to make the people who are driving populist movements feel like they are part of the global economic pie that Davos participants have created and largely own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a Twitter post from the Swiss resort, Ian Bremmer, the president of Eurasia Group, a political-research firm, offered his advice: ''Elites won't be able to manage populism until they stop seeing it as a threat and start seeing it as a symptom.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If that is the case, Davos has, so far, made little progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I want to be loud and clear: Populism scares me,'' Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, said during a panel on how to fix the middle-class crisis. ''The No. 1 issue economically as a market participant is how populism manifests itself over the next year or two.'' But Mr. Dalio offered little by way of a solution, beyond opining on the positive aspects of loosening regulation and lowering taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the subject of rising populism, Mr. Dalio, who runs the $150 billion investment firm Bridgewater Associates, added: ''It's an anti-Davos way of operating.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, offered his view of the problem in the United States. Americans, he said, ''do not distribute the money properly.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Deciphering the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Effect</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If there was one thing that Davos attendees agreed on last year, it was that Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would not win the United States presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And so this year, with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inauguration on Friday coinciding with the end of the World Economic Forum, every conversation has drifted to one question: What will the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency look like, and what will it mean for business?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To many American financiers who once opposed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> candidacy, the prospect of fewer regulations and a blank slate with a new leader has assuaged some of the fear about uncertainties. At the forum, some attendees have been thrust into a role of interpreting the president-elect to a befuddled global elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He's not necessarily communicating in a way that the people in this community would love,'' said Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund regular at Davos and onetime critic of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who is now set to join the administration as a public liaison and adviser. ''But he is communicating very, very effectively to a very large group of the population in Europe and the U.S. that are feeling a common struggle right now.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Scaramucci promised that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had ''the utmost respect for Angela Merkel,'' the German chancellor who was the subject of an attack by the president-elect this week; that he was in fact a champion of free trade; and that he wanted to have a ''phenomenal relationship with the Chinese,'' despite his fiery anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Soon after his appearance on a panel, Mr. Scaramucci was on a plane heading to Washington to attend Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inauguration. But his words still resonated, mainly because they were being broadcast on a giant screen behind a coffee bar where World Economic Forum participants congregated between meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One Davos regular, the billionaire investor Paul Singer, did not attend this year. Mr. Singer, a vociferous critic of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for most of the election campaign, was instead making his way to Washington for the inauguration, having recently donated $1 million to the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One major investor has not changed his views about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, however.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  George Soros, the investor and philanthropist who has called Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''a con man,'' hosted a dinner on Thursday evening in Davos, during which he said that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''would be a dictator if he could get away with it.'' This was unlikely to happen, he added, because of strong democratic institutions in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For those who have been puzzled over market euphoria since Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election, Mr. Soros put it this way: ''Markets see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dismantling regulations and reducing taxes -- and that has been their dream.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Soros, who became known as the man who broke the Bank of England with a bet against the British pound in 1992, added that he was convinced that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would fail. ''I don't think the markets are going to do very well,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leaders Take Center Stage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When President Xi Jinping addressed the Davos forum, becoming the first Chinese head of state to do so, his message was clear: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is ready for the world stage. He championed free trade and open markets, setting the tone for the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the sidelines, the country's business leaders echoed that sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among the delegation that arrived in Davos with Mr. Xi were some of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> biggest business leaders including Mr. Ma, Wang Jianlin of Dalian Wanda, and top executives from Baidu, Huawei Technologies and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Telecom. Through the week, they have been meeting with investors and talking deals with erstwhile partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With Mr. Xi's help, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has fashioned itself here as a new leader of the free-market world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I wasn't sure if it was President Xi or Ronald Reagan,'' joked Thomas W. Farley, president of the New York Stock Exchange. At a lunch with Mr. Ma of Alibaba, Mr. Xi was quoting Abraham Lincoln, Mr. Ma told a small group of participants on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was a message somewhat at odds with the roots of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ruling Communist Party. And back in Washington, Wilbur Ross, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nominee for commerce secretary, did not mince words, calling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''the most protectionist'' major economy, setting the stage for a possible trade war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in Davos, there was a sense that change in the economic order was afoot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alicia B&aacute;rcena Ibarra, who heads the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, told a small group that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could soon overtake the United States when it comes to importance in Latin America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She described how on the same day last year that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told the world he would not sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Mr. Xi arrived for a summit meeting in Chile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''So can you imagine the impact when he came talking about free trade as he did this morning?'' she said, referring to Mr. Xi's address on Tuesday in Davos. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> now is the second-most important trade partner of Latin America after the U.S.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Maybe this is going to change,'' she added. ''Very soon.''</SPAN></P>
