<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Islamic State claimed him as &quot;a hero soldier of the caliphate&quot; and appeared to refer to Turkey's role in the Syrian war.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with North Korea's threat to test an intercontinental ballistic missile, President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took to Twitter to declare bluntly, &quot;It won't happen!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promised to reveal &quot;things that other people don't know,&quot; possibly as soon as today, about assessments that Russia interfered in the U.S. election.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Indians agree with that sentiment, voiced by a Delhi taxi driver, saying they are more concerned about reining in corruption than the immediate hardships caused Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ban on large-currency bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">India's Supreme Court ruled that candidates for political office may not run on religion- or caste-based appeals. The decision comes ahead of assembly elections that will test the strength of Mr. Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I Can't Drive 55,&quot; the rocker Sammy Hagar once famously wailed, but 43 years ago this week, he and every other American driver were faced with obeying the first federal speed limit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Setting speed limits had been the states' responsibility. But in 1973, OPEC cut oil shipments to the United States for supporting Israel in a war with its Arab neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The embargo hit the American economy hard. In 1974, President Richard M. Nixon signed the Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act, lowering the speed limit to reduce consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And American car buyers sought out more fuel-efficient vehicles, turning to a country that had not yet been celebrated for automaking: Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate over road safety and speed limits continued for decades, and in 1995, President Bill Clinton repealed the federal limit, returning the power to the states. In parts of Texas, drivers can legally go 85 m.p.h.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the fastest in the country, though it's slower than a few places in the world. Stretches of Germany's autobahn have no maximum limit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a far cry from one of the earliest speed restrictions. In 1901, Connecticut limited some drivers to 12 miles per hour.</SPAN></P>
