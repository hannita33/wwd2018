<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- When the Philippines appeared to jilt its old ally the United States in favor of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this week, it repudiated not only President Obama and his ''pivot'' to Asia, but also Hillary Clinton, who made reaching out to the region her signature project as his secretary of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House said on Friday that it was troubled by the statements made by President Rodrigo Duterte during a visit to Beijing, in which he announced a ''separation'' of the Philippines from the United States, a treaty ally, and said it was ''time to say goodbye, my friend.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More than anything, the administration appears baffled by Mr. Duterte. He is a flamboyant figure, given to volcanic outbursts. On Friday, his own trade minister tried to pull back much of what his boss had said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I've dubbed that person the Filipino Mike Pence,'' joked the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, suggesting that Mr. Duterte was a Filipino Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later in the day, Mr. Duterte himself insisted that by ''separation'' he meant only that the Philippines planned to be more independent of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton has not addressed the turmoil between Manila and Washington since last month, when she said Mr. Obama was right to cancel a meeting with Mr. Duterte after he had unleashed a profanity-laden diatribe against Mr. Obama. But a senior official in the Clinton campaign said she shared the White House's concerns about the Philippine leader's latest statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If anything, a rift would be even more personal for Mrs. Clinton than for Mr. Obama. As secretary of state, she laid the groundwork for the president's focus on Asia and, in particular, his reassertion of America's presence in Southeast Asia. In 2011, she stood on the deck of a Navy warship in Manila Bay to dramatize support for an ally then entangled in territorial disputes with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over reefs and islands in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A year earlier, Mrs. Clinton thrust the United States into this long-running conflict, saying the United States had a stake in seeing these disputes resolved in a way that guaranteed American ships freedom of navigation through the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea's busy shipping lanes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was one of her first big initiatives as secretary of state. She kept raising it with the Chinese throughout her time at the State Department, and she said later that she viewed the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea as a litmus test in a broader geopolitical rivalry between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They have the right to assert themselves,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a closed-door speech to executives from Goldman Sachs in 2013, which was published by WikiLeaks. ''But if nobody's there to push back to create a balance, then they're going to have a chokehold on the sea lanes and also on the countries that border the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Friday, the United States dispatched a destroyer, the Decatur, into waters claimed by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to assert the freedom of navigation. The action, which drew a warning from Chinese warships and a rebuke from the Chinese Defense Ministry, was not related to Mr. Duterte's statements, a senior administration official said. But it was an illustration of Mrs. Clinton's point, and a reminder of how the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea could erupt into conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The White House is also sending a senior diplomat -- Daniel Russel, assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs -- to Manila this weekend to seek clarification of the Philippine government's position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama has generally sought to play down the rift, in part because Mr. Duterte is so erratic that it is not clear he will able to follow through on his threats. The United States remains enormously popular among Filipinos. Mr. Duterte's hostility is ''at odds with the warm relationship between the citizens of our two countries,'' Mr. Earnest said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Privately, though, administration officials worry that Mr. Duterte could suspend American access to Philippine military bases, which would constrain the United States military presence in the region. He has already talked about ending joint exercises for American and Philippine troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tensions with the Philippines could escalate further. On Capitol Hill, some are agitating to withhold aid from the Philippine police because of hundreds of extrajudicial killings of suspected drug dealers. Invoking the so-called Leahy law, which prohibits military aid to foreign units that routinely violate human rights, could provoke an even more sulfurous reaction from Mr. Duterte.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is likely to provide lucrative economic inducements to the Philippines, and could make them contingent on further weakening its links with the United States. Some former officials worry that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is playing divide-and-conquer in the region, calculating that if it can peel the Philippines away from the United States, Malaysia and Vietnam will follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The real destructiveness of this is signaling to the region that the oldest American ally can potentially be snared or lured into nonaligned status,'' Jeffrey A. Bader, a former </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> adviser to Mr. Obama, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That is a terribly destructive signal to Malaysia, to Vietnam, to Thailand, to Singapore, to Indonesia,'' he added. ''It has to send a signal to other countries about the effectiveness of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> soft power.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As part of his charm offensive with Beijing, Mr. Duterte said he would brush aside a ruling in July by an international tribunal in The Hague that found in favor of the Philippines in its territorial disputes with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He said Manila would enter into direct negotiations with Beijing over the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though the White House welcomed that news as potentially reducing the risk of a military clash in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, it could also undercut the administration's policy, which is to encourage the parties to abide by international law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has long sought direct talks with its neighbors; American officials worry that this would enable </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to bully them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton is likely to keep a low profile on this issue in the final weeks of the campaign. For one, a senior aide said, she has had no contact with Mr. Duterte or the people around him, and hence no way of assessing his motives. But the official said she remained as committed as ever to the principle of freedom of navigation and lawful commerce in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In her remarks to Goldman Sachs executives in 2013, Mrs. Clinton recalled having contentious discussions with Chinese officials over their broad -- and in her view, spurious -- claims to the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. At one point, she told them that, using their rationale, the United States could claim the Pacific Ocean from California all the way to the Philippines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We liberated it,'' she said. ''We defended it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton also expressed sympathy for the Philippines in its clash with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over one of the disputed territories, Scarborough Shoal -- a dispute that Mr. Duterte now seems ready to forget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Why are they intent upon picking this fight and asserting this at this time?'' Mrs. Clinton said to the group. ''Why are they slamming into Filipino fishing vessels? You know, a poor country that is just desperately trying to get its growth rate up and making some progress in doing that. So it bears watching, and obviously it matters to all of us.''</SPAN></P>
