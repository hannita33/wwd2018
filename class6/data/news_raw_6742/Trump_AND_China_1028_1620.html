</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good evening. Here's the latest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. &quot;I think it was Russia.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at his first news conference since July, conceding for the first time that Russia was behind the hacking of Democrats during the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other highlights: he will turn over his business to his two oldest sons and an associate; he insisted Mexico will pay for a border wall; he criticized the pharmaceutical industry, and will seek to &quot;repeal and replace&quot; the Affordable Care Act immediately.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are 10 key moments, fact checks and the transcript.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also lashed out at the media - particularly BuzzFeed, a &quot;failing pile of garbage&quot; - for publishing details of unverified accusations that Russia had compromising information about him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He praised organizations that declined to publish those details, and vigorously denied the allegations, which were dug up by a former British spy and presented to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by intelligence agencies last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kremlin's spokesman called it &quot;pulp fiction.&quot; Above at center, Buzzfeed's editor in chief, Ben Smith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. On Capitol Hill, Rex Tillerson, above, the longtime chief of ExxonMobil nominated for secretary of state, faced sharp questioning from Senator Marco Rubio over his unwillingness to criticize President Vladimir Putin of Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And at another confirmation hearing, Senator Cory Booker broke with tradition by testifying against Senator Jeff Sessions, the nominee for attorney general, rebuking him for opposing immigration, criminal justice reform and laws protecting gays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sent its sole aircraft carrier into the Taiwan Strait, demonstrating its growing naval strength and signaling an early foreign policy challenge for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, Taiwan scrambled its fighter jets and deployed a warship. It was the third time in as many days that Chinese military action spurred its neighbors to mobilize fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show of force, an analyst said, was &quot;worrisome from the U.S. and Taiwan's point of view because we don't know how much more they are going to ratchet up these pressures and tensions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Prosecutors filed criminal charges against six Volkswagen employees for their role in the company's emissions scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One was arrested in Florida last week, but the others are in Germany, which does not normally extradite its citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company also agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement, bringing the total cost of the deception in the U.S., including settlements of suits by car owners, to $20 billion, making it one of the costliest corporate scandals in history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Above, Attorney General Loretta Lynch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Dozens of U.S. ambassadors are about to leave office, but few are as prominent as Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of President John F. Kennedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During her three years as ambassador to Japan, she went from untested celebrity to respected negotiator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as the first woman to hold the post, she encouraged change in a traditionally male-dominated culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. August Wilson, the renowned late playwright and chronicler of the 20th century African-American experience, is having a moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film version of his play &quot;Fences&quot; is in theaters now, starring Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, and his early work &quot;Jitney,&quot; above, is about to open on Broadway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of our critics sat down to discuss his work. He &quot;found the divine in the down home,&quot; one said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Is Netflix deepening cultural echo chambers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a lot to criticize about broadcast TV, but it brought the nation together. Streaming services are doing the opposite, our tech critic writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Weekend warriors, rejoice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new study found that a vigorous once-a-week workout is definitely better than no workout - and maybe even as good as shorter, more frequent ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Finally, faced with the depths of winter, our Cooking team is going for soup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They created a comprehensive how-to. It's not just a recipe collection - more like a master class on the fundamental principles of soup creation, and how to apply them to a variety of ingredients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Happy slurping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help.</SPAN></P>
