<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect is lining up veteran members of the Republican foreign policy establishment to endorse his choice for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson. The Exxon Mobil chief executive will face sharp scrutiny over his ties to Russia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The French government is seeking to turn &quot;La Marseillaise,&quot; the national anthem, often associated with the political right, into a symbol of national unity. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aleksei A. Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition politician, announced his intention to run for president in 2018, vowing to make corruption a prominent issue of his campaign. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. blocked a transfer of precision munitions to Saudi Arabia because of concerns about civilian casualties in its war in Yemen. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The European Parliament's suspension of payments to a euroskeptic think tank linked to the U.K. Independence Party is part of wider scrutiny of populist groups' use of E.U. funds. [Politico]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Europeans overestimate the Continent's Muslim population, a regional poll shows. [The Guardian]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Torun, the Polish hometown of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, has for centuries closely guarded its gingerbread recipes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, researchers offer some advice on gift-giving: Recipients often don't care how much thought went into the present. In other words, don't try so hard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We told you last week about a fight in Canada over a proposed official bird, the gray jay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canadians have also sparred over whether poutine (fries topped with cheese curds and gravy) should beat out maple syrup as their most representative food (no).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some places, trademark foods are not so self-evident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Britons consider chicken tikka masala, a colonial adaptation featuring a bright orange sauce, as their national dish - more so than fish and chips. The concoction, one official said, &quot;is a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other places, there's no question about the winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, New Mexico reveres the local chile. It's nowhere near as hot as peppers in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> India or the Caribbean, but it is perhaps the most consistent ingredient in the state's dishes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawmakers in the late '90s declared the state's official question to be &quot;Red or green?&quot; As in: Which variety of chile sauce do you want?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One answer plays no favorites. Order &quot;Christmas,&quot; and you'll get both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can't handle the heat? Reach for a glass of milk, which neutralizes the capsaicin that makes your taste buds sting.</SPAN></P>
