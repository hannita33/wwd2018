</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Korea's Parliament voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye over a corruption scandal. Ms. Park has been suspended from office as the Constitutional Court considers whether to formally remove her from office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court has six months to decide whether the charges are true and merit her ouster. Here are the accusations against her.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hwang Kyo-ahn, the prime minister, is the acting president while Ms. Park is suspended. And here are some of the contenders to replace her, including Ban Ki-moon, the departing United Nations secretary general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the U.S., President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is expected to name Andrew F. Puzder, a fast-food executive, as secretary of labor. Mr. Puzder has opposed expanding overtime and raising the minimum wage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's the latest on the transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is all uncharted territory.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the feeling in America's auto industry, which expects to be reshaped by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration. A chief concern is Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> threat of tariffs on the millions of vehicles sold in the U.S. each year that were built in Japan, Korea and other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Britain, Asian automakers want assurances from the government that&quot;Brexit&quot; won't block their access to the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Hassan Rouhani of Iran has signed a wave of oil deals with Asian and European energy companies in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our officials are in a rush to sign contracts with big oil companies in order to have leverage when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> enters the White House,&quot; said an economist with close ties to the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A two-week state of emergency has been declared in the Aceh province of Indonesia, where a powerful earthquake on Wednesday killed more than 100 people and injured hundreds of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the victims were crushed in collapsed buildings,&quot; said a spokesman for the national disaster management agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dollar has surged since the U.S. election: up 8 percent against the Japanese yen and 10 percent against the Mexican peso. Against the Chinese yuan, the move has been less pronounced - just 1.5 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for emerging markets, accustomed to cheap dollar debt, the surge may signal instability in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Jordan owns the right to his name in Chinese characters, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> highest court ruled, in a landmark decision for future trademark cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Microsoft acquired LinkedIn for $26.2 billion. But there are ample reasons to be skeptical that the deal, the biggest by far in Microsoft's history, will pay off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Airbnb has faced regulatory battles in cities around the world. But New Orleans was able to gain concessions from the company that few other towns have received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The gadget age is over, our columnist writes, and it could make life a lot less fun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. markets were up. Here's a global snapshot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nguyen Ngoc Luong, a journalist who was essential to The Times coverage of the Vietnam War and refused an offer to be relocated, died in Ho Chi Minh City. He was 79. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A city in Japan is keeping track of elderly dementia patients by sticking bar codes with personal data to their fingers and toes. [BBC]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traveling to Sydney, Australia? We've got recommendations on how to spend 36 hours in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, died on Thursday. He was 95.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a Myanmar market, a paleontologist discovered a 99-million-year-old chunk of amber with the feathered tail of a dinosaur trapped inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The recovery of a woman with advanced colon cancer, after treatment with cells from her own immune system, may help doctors develop new treatments for other patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And remember the trend of new bank notes featuring women that we told you about yesterday? Canada's finance minister announced that Viola Desmond, a civil rights pioneer, will be the first Canadian woman on a note.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this day in 1917, the First World War was entrenched in some of its darkest days. The Allies were in a stalemate on the Western Front, and good news was in short supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it was a huge morale booster for the Allies when Turkish forces surrendered the holy city of Jerusalem to Britain's Gen. Edmund Allenby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister David Lloyd George called it &quot;a Christmas present for the British people.&quot; The New York Herald's front page proclaimed: &quot;Jerusalem is rescued by British after 673 years of Moslem Rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jews in the city, inspired a month earlier by Britain's Balfour Declaration in support of a Jewish homeland, rejoiced. Some Arabs, many of whom had been conscripted by the Ottomans, danced in the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two more details:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When General Allenby entered the Old City, he did so on foot and unfurled no flags, in a sign of respect. He also deployed Muslim troops to ease sectarian tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until he arrived, the mayor of Jerusalem had been scrambling to find a British official to whom he could cede control. An army cook who got lost while looking for food was initially asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He declined, saying &quot;I don't want the city; I want eggs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
