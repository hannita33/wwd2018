<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Having made contradictory comments, President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has many nations wondering about his policies. But there's also a sense that his words should not be taken too literally.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON - The Germans are angry. The Chinese are downright furious. Leaders of NATO are nervous, while their counterparts at the European Union are alarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just days before he is sworn into office, President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has again focused his penchant for unpredictable disruption on the rest of the world. His remarks in a string of discursive and sometimes contradictory interviews have escalated tensions with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while also infuriating allies and institutions critical to America's traditional leadership of the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one knows where exactly he is headed - except that the one country he is not criticizing is Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin. For now. And that he is an enthusiastic cheerleader of Brexit and an unaffiliated Britain. For now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unpredictability is perhaps his most predictable characteristic. The world is accustomed to his provocative Twitter messages, but is less clear about whether his remarks represent meaningful new policy guidelines, personal judgments or passing whims. In the interviews, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> described the European Union as &quot;basically a vehicle for Germany&quot; and predicted that the bloc would probably see other countries follow Britain's example and vote to leave.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also said Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, had made a &quot;catastrophic mistake&quot; in allowing refugees to pour into Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The barrage of inflammatory comments in joint interviews published Sunday and Monday in Britain and Germany elicited alarm and outrage in Europe, even as Ms. Merkel dryly characterized Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> positions as nothing new.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have been known for a while - my positions are also known,&quot; Ms. Merkel said Monday in Berlin. &quot;I think we Europeans have control of our destiny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her clipped response came as officials and analysts struggled with how to interpret Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remarks, as well as how to react to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some argued that the president-elect's words should be regarded as tactical, intended merely to keep his options open. But nearly everyone agreed that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had made trouble, especially in criticizing Ms. Merkel, given her importance as a figure of stability in Europe and her campaign for re-election later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For good measure, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had also infuriated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by using an interview on Friday with The Wall Street Journal to again question </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> longstanding One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy. It holds that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the mainland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said that anyone trying to use the status of Taiwan for negotiations would be &quot;smashing their feet by lifting a rock&quot; and would face broad and strong opposition from the Chinese government and people, as well as the international community. She added that &quot;not everything in the world can be bargained or traded off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The English-language </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daily accused Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Monday of &quot;playing with fire,&quot; saying that if Taiwan became up for negotiation, as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggested to The Journal, &quot;Beijing will have no choice but to take off the gloves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interviews in Europe have placed him right in the middle of the Continent's most contentious issues. His critique of German dominance over the European Union is hardly a novel thought; many Europeans share the same complaints. But what is startling is how an incoming American president would make such a statement about a key ally and, in doing so, give succor to populist parties seeking to shatter the European political establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the interview published Monday in the German newspaper Bild and The Times of London, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also equated his trust of Ms. Merkel with his trust for Mr. Putin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I start off trusting both,&quot; he said during the joint interview, which was conducted inside his office in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in New York, &quot;but let's see how long that lasts. It may not last long at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> knows how to give a provocative interview. He repeated past criticisms that NATO is &quot;obsolete&quot; for supposedly not confronting terrorism, only to quickly add that &quot;with that being said, NATO is very important to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments &quot;are a direct assault on the liberal order we've built since 1945 and a repudiation of the idea that the United States should lead the West,&quot; said R. Nicholas Burns, a former senior State Department official and ambassador to NATO, who also advised the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To say that NATO is obsolete, openly support the disintegration of the E.U. and then denigrate Merkel and put her on a par with Putin is a fundamental break with 70 years of American policy and strategic thought supported by Republicans from Eisenhower to now,&quot; said Mr. Burns, who has served presidents of both parties. &quot;NATO is the great power differential between the United States and Russia, as our Asian alliances are the power differential between us and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remarks almost certainly rankled Europe's two most powerful leaders, Ms. Merkel and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> enthusiasm for Britain's vote to leave the European Union, or Brexit - if welcomed by British officials, in general terms - has put considerably more pressure on Mrs. May. She is preparing to give a major speech on Tuesday about her Brexit plans, even as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promised to give Britain a quick and fair trade deal outside the European Union - a deal that cannot take place for at least two years until Britain leaves the bloc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Awkwardly for her, one of the interviewers was Michael Gove, who strongly supported Brexit and ran for the Conservative leadership against Mrs. May, who immediately fired him from the cabinet. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first meeting with a British politician was with another May adversary, Nigel Farage, the former leader of the anti-Europe U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Merkel, who is known for her sang-froid and pragmatism, shrugged off Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> latest criticism, saying that what matters is what he does in office. &quot;I am waiting for the president to be sworn into office. That is the way it is done,&quot; she said. &quot;And then, of course, I will work with him together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was not so sanguine. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments had &quot;caused astonishment and commotion, and I'm sure not just in Brussels,&quot; where he spoke on Monday before a monthly meeting of European Union foreign ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Steinmeier said that he had just seen the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and that there was continuing concern inside the military alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First, it goes against the statements of the nominated defense secretary a few days ago,&quot; Mr. Steinmeier said. &quot;We have to see what it will yield in terms of U.S. foreign policy. The same goes for the statements on trade policy. We count on the U.S. to stick to its international obligations, including in the World Trade Organization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others cautioned against taking Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> words literally, at least for now. &quot;I take all of this with a pinch of salt,&quot; said Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, the London-based research institution. &quot;I think </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is trying to keep his options open and not be cornered by simply standing up for existing policy positions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team will try to begin to smooth over some of the tensions on Tuesday in Washington, where the group planning his inauguration will host a black-tie dinner for members of the foreign diplomatic corps to mingle with prospective cabinet members, leaders of Congress and Vice President-elect Mike Pence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama's departing ambassador to Germany, John B. Emerson, has used a series of exit interviews and speeches in recent days to urge the Germans to stay calm, not to overinterpret Twitter posts or view them as finished foreign policy. Mr. Emerson underscored that, while more clarity was needed, there were signs that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did value NATO and the promise of United States protection for European allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a very crucial issue, not just for European security, but for American security,&quot; Mr. Emerson said. He noted that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;authorized President Obama when he came here on his trip shortly after the two of them met to reassure European partners of the full commitment to NATO. Now, we need to see what that means.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Europe is staring at a potentially transformative political year, with elections coming in the Netherlands, France and Germany, and possibly in Italy. Victories by populist parties could destabilize the European Union, and many European officials worry that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attacks are damaging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Sch&auml;fer, a spokesman for Mr. Steinmeier and the German Foreign Ministry, flatly rejected Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comment in the interview that the European Union &quot;is basically a vehicle for Germany.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perhaps in times such as these, when order is crumbling, it is more important than ever that we want to, and must, stand together,&quot; Mr. Sch&auml;fer said, underlining the post-World War II German stance that only through the country's role in a larger European alliance are peace and prosperity guaranteed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault of France said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments were an invitation to the bloc to stand united. &quot;As is the case with Brexit,&quot; he said, &quot;the best way of defending Europe, and that is the invitation Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has given to us, is to remain united as a bloc, not forgetting that the strength of Europeans lies in their unity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who supported Brexit, emphasized Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warm comments on the Anglo-American relationship. &quot;I think it's very good news that the U.S.A. wants to do a good free trade deal with us and wants to do it very fast,&quot; he said. &quot;Clearly it will have to be a deal that's very much in the interests of both sides, but I have no doubt it will be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
