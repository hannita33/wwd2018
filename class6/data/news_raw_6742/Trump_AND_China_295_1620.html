<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Evangelical leaders said they are confident Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will appoint a conservative Supreme Court justice, defund Planned Parenthood and stop requiring insurers to cover birth control.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rarely goes to church, said he's never sought forgiveness for his sins, and in his acceptance speech early Wednesday morning, never mentioned God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religion was almost invisible during the presidential campaign, and yet it is the missing piece in understanding Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory. The Christian right worked largely under the national media's radar this year, but it helped deliver the presidency to a thrice-married mogul who bragged about groping women and has been accused by multiple women of actually doing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were willing to forgive Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> personal transgressions because he stoked their fears that a Hillary Clinton administration would take away their religious liberties, use their tax dollars to fund late-term abortions at home and abroad, and expand the rights of gay and transgender people, political analysts said. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warned at rallies and at conservative Christian gatherings that he alone was their last hope to protect them against a changing culture, using the refrain, &quot;This is your last chance.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that he has won, evangelical leaders say they are confident Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will deliver on the political promises he made to them. These include appointing a conservative to the Supreme Court, defunding Planned Parenthood, protecting businesses that refuse to provide services for same-sex weddings and rescinding the mandate in the Affordable Care Act that requires insurance coverage for birth control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, an evangelical with a record of legislating against abortion and same-sex marriage, as vice president, Christian leaders say they feel reassured they will have access to the White House and a seat at the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am confident he will do as president what he said he would do as a candidate,&quot; said Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, who helped mobilize Christian voters for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White evangelicals and Catholics voted for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at even higher rates than they voted for the last two Republican presidential nominees, John McCain and Mitt Romney, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The wall of white Christian voters held,&quot; said Robert P. Jones, chief executive of the Public Religion Research Institute and author of &quot;The End of White Christian America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White evangelicals make up 26 percent of the American electorate, and 81 percent of them voted for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, despite loud criticism by some in their ranks that he was racist, misogynistic and unfit for the presidency. Only 16 percent voted for Mrs. Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catholics, who make up 23 percent of the electorate, supported Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over Mrs. Clinton by 52 percent to 45 percent. White Catholics voted for him in far greater proportions than Hispanic Catholics, who favored Mrs. Clinton over Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 67 to 26 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was no way he had a chance without the pop of that Catholic vote,&quot; Mr. Reed said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was not the first choice of most evangelicals or Catholics. But he gradually won their trust, speaking at Liberty University in Virginia, the largest Christian college in the country, doing nine interviews with Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network and building relationships with Pentecostal preachers. In June, he met with nearly one thousand evangelical and Catholic leaders from around the country in a hotel ballroom in New York. In October, he sent a letter to the Catholic Leadership Conference in Denver, promising, &quot;I will fight for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton, in contrast, failed to connect with white evangelicals and Catholics, said Michael Wear, a political consultant who served as a faith adviser for President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Evangelicals feel embattled, they feel isolated, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> understood that and appealed to them on completely Machiavellian terms. But Hillary actually confirmed their sense of isolation by not reaching out to them,&quot; said Mr. Wear, the author of &quot;Reclaiming Hope: Lessons Learned in the Obama White House About the Future of Faith in America.&quot; &quot;Hillary's lack of outreach basically told evangelicals, 'You need </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as much as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says you do.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As recently as five years ago, Christians were far more judgmental of politicians accused of transgressions in their personal lives. Now, in the era of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, there is more tolerance, especially among evangelicals, according to a study by Mr. Jones's institute. The group often called &quot;values voters&quot; was not dissuaded by headlines about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sexually harassing women, lying, refusing to pay taxes or stiffing contractors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has really changed their entire political ethic. It's moved from a principled basis to more of a utilitarian ethic, where the ends justify the means,&quot; Mr. Jones said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grace and forgiveness are at the core of Christian faith, and it was only natural for evangelicals to extend that concept to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said Eric Metaxas, an evangelical writer and radio host in New York City whose endorsement surprised many of his friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We understand. We're all screwed up. We all sin. To judge people by fussy moral standards is something I think is no longer the issue it used to be,&quot; Mr. Metaxas said. &quot;I think a lot of people believe he's not the person he was in 2005,&quot; the year Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was recorded on videotape saying he made a habit of kissing and grabbing women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were prominent evangelicals publicly opposed to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - a phenomenon that Mr. Reed argued only brought more attention to those who supported him. But now that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is headed for the White House, some of those &quot;Never </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; evangelicals are coming around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russell Moore, president of the Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, said he would &quot;give the new president the benefit of the doubt.&quot; If Nixon could go to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Moore said, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could be a &quot;unifying figure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
