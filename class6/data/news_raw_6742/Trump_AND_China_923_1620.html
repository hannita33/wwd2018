<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A variety of other social media accounts have also moved with the change of power.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the final hours of the 44th presidency, as Barack and Michelle Obama prepared to leave the White House, their digital lives parted ways with the .gov addresses and official social media accounts where they have resided for the past eight years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 12:01 p.m. Friday, the new president, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, was officially in control of the @Potus account on Twitter, the site he used to spearhead the communications arm of his campaign, and has continued to use enthusiastically since his election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC News has reported that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans to continue to use his own account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transition sources tell me @realDonaldTrump intends to keep using his own account as president, not switching to @potus himself - Kelly O'Donnell (@KellyO) January 16, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if to illustrate the point, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began tweeting again less than an hour after his speech, from his @RealDonaldTrump account. But the @Potus account did not remain dormant for long - shortly after 2 p.m., it sent its first tweet of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> era, a link to a Facebook transcript of the president's inaugural address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many on Twitter noted that when the @Potus account was unveiled with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> picture, it bore as its cover photo a stock image that was taken at Mr. Obama's first inauguration. The photo was quickly changed, to a zoomed-in stock photo of an enormous American flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new website, Obama.org, emerged on Friday, with a video featuring Mr. Obama and Mrs. Obama, in which the 44th president and the first lady announced their intentions going forward as private citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First,&quot; Mrs. Obama said, &quot;we're going to take a little break.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But afterward, Mr. Obama said, the couple would start work on several projects, most prominently the Obama Foundation, which will be based on the South Side of Chicago, and will be a &quot;living, working center for citizenship&quot; that will focus on unspecified projects in that city, as well as the rest of the country and all over the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obamas then asked viewers for their input on the projects the new organization would undertake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As I've said many times before, true Democracy is a project that's much bigger than any one of us,&quot; Mr. Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent days, the Obamas had announced their new Twitter handles, using their names, @MichelleObama and @BarackObama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WhiteHouse.gov website as it existed under Mr. Obama will be available at ObamaWhiteHouse.gov, while social media posts by the Obamas and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his wife, Jill, will be archived at new accounts. A full list of those accounts, as well as the new addresses the families will use going forward and the accounts that will be taken up by Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, his family, his advisers and his cabinet, can be found here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A favorite social media account of White House watchers for the past eight years, the administration's Flickr archive, will remain online. That account, stuffed to the brim with images from the photographer Pete Souza, can be found at Flickr.com/ObamaWhiteHouse.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Related Articles</SPAN><BR></P>
