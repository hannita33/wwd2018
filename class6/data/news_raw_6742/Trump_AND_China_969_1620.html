</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not have a yellow Labrador retriever named Spinee that is recovering from surgery. Neither does Hillary Clinton. Those rumors, curiously enough, are propagated by an internet hoax site that seems to delight in pranking celebrities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mrs. Clinton does have two dogs, Tally and Maisie, which, if she were elected president, would be the latest in an illustrious and colorful line of first pets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, if elected, would be the first president since Harry Truman without a pet. (Mr. Truman's family was given a couple of dogs that did not take up permanent residence at the White House.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is one of the many things that set the two major party nominees apart, though how much this matters to the public is unclear. But owning a cute dog or mischievous cat can be a political asset: When Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin was running for the Republican nomination, his allergy to pet dander was seen as a potential liability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Entire books have been written about presidential pets, and presidents are frequently given animals once they reach office (though often those animals are re-gifted). So presumably, if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reached office, he would receive some animals as a reward. (Feel free to speculate about the type and breed.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While dogs have been the most popular option for leaders of the free world, there have been many exotic animals in the White House: John Quincy Adams kept an alligator in a bathtub near the yet-to-be-finished East Room; William Howard Taft brought his cow, Mooly Wooly, with him to Washington; and Theodore Roosevelt and his large family owned, at various times, a pig named Maude, a snake named Emily Spinach and a badger named Josiah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dave Baker, co-owner of the Presidential Pet Museum, is partial to the story of Andrew Jackson's pet parrot, Poll. ''It was taught to curse like a sailor, and caused such a ruckus at Jackson's funeral that the bird was promptly escorted out,'' said Mr. Baker, of Queens, a 41-year-old copy editor who also runs a website called Petful. The story of Poll, he said, ''keeps going viral on Reddit.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Presidential Pet Museum -- such as it is -- exists as a website full of information and pictures, plus a motley collection of memorabilia currently in storage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The items were lovingly collected and curated by Claire D. McLean, a retired dog groomer who took care of President Ronald Reagan's bouvier des Flandres, Lucky. Ms. McLean spirited out some of Lucky's fur trimmings in a bag, and her mother made a portrait of the dog that incorporated them, inspiring her daughter to start the museum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. McLean, who is no longer able to operate the museum, and Mr. Baker, who has other things to attend to, are trying to sell the website and artifacts in an online auction, so far without luck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So how do the current candidates fit into this mostly four-legged history?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton is a well-known dog lover who has spoken out against puppy mills. Her dog Maisie is a curly-haired mutt, and Tally is a toy poodle mix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Bill Clinton was in the White House, the couple acquired a chocolate brown Labrador retriever named Buddy, who was a comfort to the president during the difficult days of his impeachment over the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Buddy later died after being hit by a car in Chappaqua, N.Y., where the couple reside. The Clintons adopted a great-nephew of Buddy's, Seamus, in 2002; he died recently, apparently of old age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Socks, the Clintons' White House cat, was a favorite of the first daughter, Chelsea, but not of her parents, both of whom are allergic to cats, or of Buddy. So great was the acrimony that when the family decamped for Chappaqua after Mr. Clinton's second term, Socks did not make the trip; he was sent into ''exile,'' as news reports described it, with Mr. Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, in suburban Virginia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chelsea Clinton is now a dog person. Her miniature Yorkshire terrier, Soren, is named after the Danish existential philosopher Soren Kierkegaard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When it comes to animals, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family is better known for hunting them. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> two eldest sons have been criticized for a safari they took in Zimbabwe in 2011, when they posed for pictures next to a large water buffalo and other creatures they had shot for sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton used this episode as a political weapon in August, telling animal rights protesters that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trumps</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had ''killed a lot of animals.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has no pets, according to his campaign. However, a curious hoax website called MediaMass has for years been pumping out the fiction that ''Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> adored Labrador retriever 'Spinee' has undergone a risky surgery on Wednesday and is luckily beginning the slow process of recovery.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  People have been sending Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> heartfelt tweets wishing Spinee a speedy recovery since at least 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But wait, there's more: MediaMass -- a site that says its goal is ''media criticism through satire'' -- has been spreading the exact same Spinee rumor about thousands of celebrities and public figures, including Mrs. Clinton. The identical article has been written about Stephen King, Miley Cyrus, Denzel Washington and Steve Martin, to name a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An email to MediaMass, which seems to be based in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> went unanswered, perhaps not surprisingly.</SPAN></P>
