<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one is more perplexed by Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> than the leaders of the Republican Party. On May 5, after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> effectively clinched the Republican nomination, Paul Ryan famously asked:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does he share our values and our principles on limited government, the proper role of the executive, adherence to the Constitution? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the speaker of the Republican-dominated House, Ryan could have posed a harder question: Do Republican voters ''share our values and our principles''?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The answer to this question, based at least on the 10.7 million votes cast for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Republican primaries and caucuses so far, is ''no.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But that's not all. There is also strong evidence that most traditional public opinion surveys inadvertently hide a segment of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters. Many voters are reluctant to admit to a live interviewer that they back a candidate who has adopted such divisive positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In matchups between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Hillary Clinton, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does much better in polls conducted online, in which respondents click their answers on a computer screen, rather than in person-to-person landline and cellphone surveys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An aggregation by RealClearPolitics of 10 recent telephone polls gives Clinton a nine-point lead over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. In contrast, the combined results for the YouGov and Morning Consult polls, which rely on online surveys, place Clinton's lead at four points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why is this important? Because an online survey, whatever other flaws it might have, resembles an anonymous voting booth far more than what you tell a pollster does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a May 2015 report, Pew Research analyzed the differences between results derived from telephone polling and those from online Internet polling. Pew determined that the biggest differences in answers elicited via these two survey modes were on questions in which social desirability bias -- that is, ''the desire of respondents to avoid embarrassment and project a favorable image to others'' -- played a role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a detailed analysis of phone versus online polling in Republican primaries, Kyle A. Dropp, the executive director of polling and data science at Morning Consult, writes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advantage in online polls compared with live telephone polling is eight or nine percentage points among likely voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This difference, Dropp notes, is driven largely by more educated voters -- those who would be most concerned with ''social desirability.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These findings suggest that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will head into the general election with support from voters who are reluctant to admit their preferences to a live person in a phone survey, but who may well be inclined to cast a ballot for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Conflicting online and phone poll findings in response to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> call on Dec. 7, 2015 -- five days after two terrorists killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. -- for a ''total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on'' demonstrate the difficulty gauging </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Phone-based surveys in December by the Washington Post/ABC News, CBS News and NBC/Wall Street Journal found strong majorities -- 57 to 60 percent -- of Americans opposed to the proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, YouGov, operating online, found substantial and growing support for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposal, with a plurality, 45-41, in support. When YouGov repeated the question on March 24-25 -- just after the terrorist attacks in Brussels -- support had grown to 51-40.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This December-to-March shift was strongest among independent voters, who increased their support from 42-37 in favor of the ban to 62-37 in favor. Similarly, a March 29 Morning Consult online poll found majority support for the ban, 50-38, with voters who identified themselves as independents favoring </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plan 49-36.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I asked a number of experts about the disparity between online and phone polls. All of them -- Alan Abramowitz, John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck, political scientists who specialize in the analysis of poll data -- agreed that in the case of highly contentious issues, respondents can be more willing to express their real views anonymously, to a computer rather than to a human.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kathy Frankovic, the former CBS polling director who now works for YouGov, told me that ''it's easier to express potentially 'unacceptable' responses on a screen than it is to give them to a person.'' Douglas Rivers, a political scientist at Stanford and the chief scientist for YouGov, agreed, noting in an email that stronger support in online polls for a ban on Muslims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  may be due to social desirability bias -- people are more willing to express support for this privately than when asked by someone else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Needless to say, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has expressed confrontational views on a number of fronts. He claims that as president he will impose harsh tariffs on imports from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, suspend Muslim immigration, deport 11 million immigrants and build an $8 billion wall that Mexico will pay for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Taken together, these positions have provided a foundation for the strong correlation between support for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and white ethnocentrism and white racial resentment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One method of ranking whites on ethnocentrism is to measure the degree to which they believe Caucasians are more trustworthy, intelligent, industrious and less violent than African-Americans, Hispanics and other minorities. These are the kinds of questions that prompt certain respondents in phone surveys to mask their views and provide socially acceptable answers instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The accompanying chart, which uses data provided to The Times by Marc Hetherington and Drew Engelhardt, political scientists at Vanderbilt, shows that white Republicans are the most ethnocentric of all voters, but also that there are substantial numbers of ethnocentric white Democrats and white independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This suggests that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could potentially find significant levels of support not only among Republican voters, but also among white Democrats and independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appears to have the Republican nomination in hand, the question becomes: Can he capitalize on racial resentment among Democrats and independents in the general election?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Perhaps not surprisingly, Hetherington and Engelhardt found that racial resentment follows a similar pattern to the expression of white ethnocentrism. It is highest among Republicans, but it is also present among Democrats and independents. The second chart derived from their data shows that in rankings of racial resentment, more than half of white Republicans, 58 percent, fall into the top four most resentful categories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What should prove worrisome for Democrats is that 42 percent of white independents also fall into the four most resentful categories, as do 22 percent of white Democrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even polls using traditional phone survey methods find notable support for issues high on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agenda. You can see this, for example, in attitudes toward the Chinese, Muslims and Mexicans -- all of whom </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has demonized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anger toward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appears to offer fertile ground for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the general election. In its 2015 American Values Survey, the Public Religion Research Institute asked how responsible </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is for American ''economic problems.'' Solid majorities of Democrats (70 percent), independents (72 percent) and Republicans (80 percent) said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is ''very'' or ''somewhat'' responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Or take another </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> theme: Islam. The P.R.R.I. values survey asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement ''the values of Islam are at odds with American values and way of life.'' Among all voters, 56 percent said that they agreed. Republican were strongest at 76 percent, but independents came in at 57 percent, with Democrats trailing at a still robust 43 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Polling Report, an aggregation of public opinion surveys, presents data on immigration from multiple sources. On a basic question -- what should happen to the 11 million undocumented men, women and children now living within the borders of the United States -- most traditional surveys show strong support for finding ways to legalize the status of those who have not committed crimes and have paid taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A March 2016 Pew study found, for example, that voters preferred allowing undocumented immigrants to stay in the United States over attempting to deport them by 74-25. It also found that a majority said immigrants strengthen the country (as opposed to adding a burden), 57-35. These are not good numbers for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But poll results (irrespective of whether questions are posed online or by phone) can change quite a bit depending on their exact wording, the specific issues addressed and even the placement of a query in a series of questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For example, a September 2015 Pew survey asked a related but different set of questions about immigrants that produced results more favorable to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prospects. Voters reported (50-28) that they believe that immigrants damage the economy (as opposed to making it better), with a fifth saying that immigrants don't have much effect. Voters also reported that they think that immigrants make crime worse rather than better (50-7), with 41 percent saying that they don't have much effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There are a few conclusions to be drawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  First, the way </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has positioned himself outside of the traditional boundaries of politics will make it unusually difficult to gauge public support for him and for many of his positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Second, the allegiance of many white Democrats and independents is difficult to predict -- cross-pressured as they are by the conflict between unsavory </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> positions they are drawn to and conscience or compunction. The ambivalence of many Republicans toward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as their party's brazenly defiant nominee will further compound the volatility of the electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Finally, the simple fact that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has beaten the odds so far means that it is not beyond the realm of possibility that he could beat them again. If he does take the White House, much, if not all, of his margin of victory will come from voters too ashamed to acknowledge publicly how they intend to cast their vote.</SPAN></P>
