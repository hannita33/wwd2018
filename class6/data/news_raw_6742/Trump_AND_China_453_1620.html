</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The contention that Americans chose </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for his racist or sexist views is wrong; many voted for him despite that.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won the white working-class vote over Hillary Clinton by a larger margin than any major-party nominee since World War II. Instead of this considerable achievement inspiring introspection, figures from the heights of journalism, entertainment, literature and the Clinton campaign continue to suggest that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won the presidency by appealing to the bigotry of his supporters. As Bill Clinton recently said, the one thing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> knows &quot;is how to get angry white men to vote for him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This stereotyping of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> voters is not only illiberal, it falsely presumes Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won because of his worst comments about women and minorities rather than despite them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, had those people who agreed that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lacked &quot;a sense of decency&quot; voted for Mrs. Clinton, she would have been elected the next president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Clinton and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> equally won over party loyalists. Yet about one in five voters did not have a favorable view of either candidate. These voters overwhelmingly backed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Exit polls demonstrated that if voters who disapproved of both candidates had divided evenly between them, Mrs. Clinton would have won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several weeks before the election, a Quinnipiac University poll found that 51 percent of white working-class voters did not believe that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had a &quot;sense of decency&quot; and ranked Mrs. Clinton slightly higher on that quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they were not voting on decency. Indeed, one-fifth of voters - more than 25 million Americans - said they &quot;somewhat&quot; disapproved of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> treatment of women. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won three-quarters of these voters, despite their disapprobation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bluntly put, much of the white working class decided that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could be a jerk. Absent any other champion, they supported the jerk they thought was more on their side - that is, on the issues that most concerned them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And anti-immigrant blowback, for instance, was not what unified them. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposed expelling illegal immigrants yet more of his voters, by a 50 percent to 45 percent margin, said illegal immigrants working here should be offered a chance to apply for legal status rather than be deported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Obama era, we also saw that race was not a critical driver of white swing votes. Barack Obama won more support among white men in 2008, including the working class, than any Democrat since 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama's support among these whites was at its peak in 2008 after the stock market crash. At the depths of the Great Recession that followed, blue-collar white men experienced the most job losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their support began hemorrhaging after Mr. Obama chose early in his presidency - when congressional Democrats could have overcome Republican obstruction - to fight for health care reform instead of a &quot;new New Deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 2016, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> personified the vote against the status quo, one still not working out for them. A post-campaign study comparing the George W. Bush coalition in 2000 to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coalition in 2016 found that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> particularly improved in areas hurt most by competition from Chinese imports, from the bygone brick and tile industry of Mason City, Iowa, to the flagging furniture plants of Hickory, N.C. The study concluded that, had the import competition from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> been half as large, Mrs. Clinton would have won key swing states and the presidency with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This argument does not ignore bigotry. Racism appeared more concentrated among </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> voters. One poll found that four in 10 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters said blacks were more &quot;lazy&quot; than whites, compared with one-quarter of Clinton or John Kasich supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But traits are not motives and don't necessarily decide votes. Consider that four in 10 liberal Democrats, the largest share of any group, said in 2011 that they would hold a Mormon candidate's faith against him or her. It would be silly to argue that, therefore, liberals voted for Mr. Obama because Mitt Romney was Mormon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coalition continues to be branded as white backlash. The stereotyping forgets that many </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters held a progressive outlook. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won nearly one in four voters who wanted the next president to follow more liberal policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democrats need only recall Mr. Clinton to understand how voters can support someone in spite of his faults. Mr. Clinton won re-election in 1996 despite a majority, including about a third of liberal voters, saying he was not honest. His approval rating reached the highest point of his presidency during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. It wasn't that Democrats and independents endorsed Mr. Clinton's behavior. They opposed Republicans more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two decades later, we are reminded again that a vote for a presidential candidate is not a vote for every aspect of him. We can look for the worst in our opponents, but that doesn't always explain how they got the best of us.</SPAN></P>
