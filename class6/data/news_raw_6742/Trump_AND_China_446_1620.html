<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The United States is Japan's most important ally, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will want to find out how serious Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was in his campaign criticisms.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan is planning to sit down withDonald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in New York on Thursday, in what would be the president-elect's first meeting with a foreign leader since his election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why are they meeting?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Abe wants to find out how serious Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was during his campaign when he repeatedly criticized Japan on trade issues and for not paying more of the cost of its own defense.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And since the Japanese establishment was expecting Hillary Clinton to win the presidency, Mr. Abe wants to assure Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that he is willing and eager to work with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is Mr. Abe most worried about?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister is concerned about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commitment to protecting Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is Japan's most important ally, and is legally obligated to defend it against attack. There are around 50,000 American troops stationed in Japan, a powerful deterrent against the rising threat of North Korea, and an increasingly assertive </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the campaign, President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggested he might withdraw American troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As president, could he do that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not without resistance from members of Congress, officials at the State Department, diplomats and military advisers. The United States-Japan alliance has been in place since the end of World War II, and has a lot of backing on both sides of the Pacific Ocean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can Japan pay the United States more for defense?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe. There are signs that Japan might be willing to pay or do more, but many experts contend American troops are not only defending Japan but the United States' own interests in Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pentagon is budgeted to spend about $5.5 billion to support troops and bases on Okinawa and elsewhere around Japan this year. Japan is set to spend $1.8 billion to support the bases, in addition to at least $4 billion on related expenses, including compensation for the communities that host the bases and funds for relocating American troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under its Constitution, which was written by American occupying forces after World War II, Japan can keep an army for defensive purposes. But Mr. Abe has said he wants to revise the Constitution and expand the military. In August, his government requested the latest in a series of increases in military spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would Japan pursue nuclear weapons?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan has committed to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and Mr. Abe will probably remind Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the campaign trail, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decried the cost of providing a so-called nuclear umbrella to allies such as Japan and South Korea that do not have their own nuclear arms. In March, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told The New York Times that he was open to those countries building their own nuclear arsenals, but on Twitter this week he denied having said so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Abe has reaffirmed his country's commitment not to develop atomic weapons. Any move to do so would face severe public opposition in Japan, the only country that has suffered a nuclear attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Mr. Abe press his case on trade and the Trans-Pacific Partnership?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been one of the biggest enthusiasts for the Trans-Pacific Partnership - or TPP, as it is known - though Japan was the last of a dozen Pacific Rim countries to join the sweeping trade pact. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repeatedly criticized the TPP during the presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Abe made politically painful concessions on agricultural imports to close the deal and get Japanese manufacturers tariff-free access to export markets in the United States and elsewhere. The trade partnership could bolster the limp economic growth rate in his country and serve as a counterweight to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the region's fast-rising superpower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election, isn't TPP dead?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Abe acknowledged after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory that the Trans-Pacific Partnership was in a &quot;very difficult situation.&quot; But his government still plans to have Parliament ratify the agreement, and he has not given up on selling it to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Abe may also seek to soften Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> angry campaign stance, in which he accused Japan of crushing the United States on trade, and manipulating its currency to gain an economic advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says he's for free trade in principle, but wants a &quot;better deal&quot; for the United States. What that means, for now, remains a mystery.</SPAN></P>
