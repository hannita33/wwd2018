<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Boston Globe published a parody front page on Sunday that offered a satirical view of a Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fake page, with headlines like ''Deportations to Begin'' and ''Markets Sink as Trade War Looms,'' ran as the front page of the newspaper's ''Ideas'' section, with an editorial denouncing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> candidacy on the next page. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The spoof, says the editorial, was intended to take Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rhetoric and his policy positions to their ''logical conclusion.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is an exercise in taking a man at his word,'' the editorial says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was no immediate comment from Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The editorial called the billionaire businessman a ''demagogue'' whose own political vision is ''profoundly un-American.'' And it cast his closest rival for the 2016 Republican nomination, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, as ''equally extreme'' and urged Republicans, at the party's nominating convention in July, to draft a ''plausible, honorable'' alternative, suggesting House Speaker Paul Ryan or former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mock </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> page was conceived and executed by the Globe's editorial writers, columnists and commentary editors, who make up the newspaper's editorial board, said Ellen Clegg, the newspaper's editorial page editor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Clegg stressed in a telephone interview that the front-page parody ''does not involve our newsroom.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mock front page envisions a host of political, financial and international scenarios ranging from disturbing to darkly humorous, all playing on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments about illegal immigration, Muslims, national security and the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A top story on the page opens with the paragraph: ''Worldwide stocks plunged again Friday, completing the worst month on record as trade wars with both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mexico seem imminent.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another story was about unrest in the ranks of the United States military as soldiers refused orders to kill family members of Islamic State militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a more tongue-in-cheek vein, a brief item reported that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was on the ''short list'' for the Nobel Peace Prize. ''His feat? Healing a 1,385-year-old schism between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, which has fueled bloody conflicts across the globe for centuries.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Clegg said it was not the first time that the Globe, which tends to lean Democratic on its opinion pages, has editorialized against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but it marked its most ''resolute'' opposition to his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
