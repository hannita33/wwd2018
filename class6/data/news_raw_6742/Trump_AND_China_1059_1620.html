<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call In the Professionals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> biggest selling point when he entered this campaign was that he's not a professional politician but a crack deal maker who can fix what's broken in Washington. So who are Republicans relying on to salvage his candidacy as poll numbers drop? The professional politician Mike Pence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the vice-presidential debate on Tuesday, Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton's running mate, presented Mr. Pence with a formidable bill of particulars about his new boss: Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> yearslong birther campaign against President Obama, his appeals to white supremacists and his grotesque sexism, his boasts about avoiding income tax, his charity scams and his attempt to discredit an American-born judge hearing a fraud case against his sham university.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Pence -- six-term member of the House, former leader of his party's conservative congressional caucus, lifelong fighter for nearly every conservative principle that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has rejected -- did his professional best to cast Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the outsider savior of the government. ''Look, he's not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton.'' Mr. Pence said. ''Things don't always come out the way he means them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Actually, things come out exactly the way Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> means them. Over the course of his campaign, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has talked less about how he alone can bring dispassionate business sense to Washington. Instead, his behavior suggests a TV caricature, a preening Monopoly millionaire seeking power to enrich himself and destroy a long list of perceived enemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It would take Mr. Pence longer than 90 minutes to undo that, but so far he's the only man on the ticket who's trying.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Racist Gags in Chinatown</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jesse Watters does gag man-on-the-street interviews for Bill O'Reilly's show on Fox News. For a segment ostensibly about Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he went to Chinatown in Manhattan and asked people about bowing, karate and herbal sex potions. He moaned in fake ecstasy as a woman massaged his ... feet. He ridiculed an old woman, who smiled but did not answer with his microphone in her face. The video then cut to Madeline Kahn in ''Young Frankenstein'' shrieking, ''Speak, speak, why don't you speak?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The clich&eacute;s and mockery were crude and brutal, even for Mr. Watters, who has delivered videos like these to his boss for years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asian-American advocacy groups have demanded an apology, which they did not get. Mr. Watters, on Twitter, just shifted the blame to them, for misunderstanding his ''light piece.'' He wrote, ''I regret if anyone found offense.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The context here is the bigotry the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign has been stoking all year, and the white grievance that Mr. O'Reilly and his network traffic in. He made this explicit years ago on his show, when he said, of The Times and its pro-immigrant editorials, ''They want to break down the white Christian male power structure.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Right. Complaining to Mr. Watters last month about Black Lives Matter, he said: ''When you deal with minority Americans -- absolute minefield now. You say something wrong -- Oh! There you go. Gotcha!'' He held his hands up, in a don't-shoot pose, as if he were the defenseless one.</SPAN></P>
