</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's that time of year again: The world's most expensive networking event starts at the snowy resort of Davos in Switzerland on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, Xi Jinping will be the first Chinese president to grace the World Economic Forum with his presence. Theresa May, Britain's prime minister, will also attend for the first time. Mrs. May is expected this week to detail her objectives for when she starts the formal process of negotiating Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. Along with world leaders and businesspeople, Shakira and Forest Whitaker will be in attendance as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's how the whole event comes together and how the hierarchy is maintained within the forum.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big question: How does the so-called Davos Man, a term coined by a political scientist to describe the economic elite, stack up against Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the world hierarchy? Do the economic policies advocated by global executives at Davos over the years still hold sway after the populist surge of the last year?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's complicated. The dire warnings over the economic fallout of a vote for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or in favor of Brexit have not come to pass. The underlying strength of the economy could be an argument for the benefits of globalization and free trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it has to do with safety nets and institutions that eliminate some of the costs associated with churn,&quot; Pietra Rivoli, a professor at Georgetown University, said of the populist backlash of the past year. &quot;What you have in the United States is a quite rational response to the failure of policy to deal with these dislocations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On top of this, many at Davos will be keeping their ears to the ground to figure out what Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ascent means for efforts to confront the threat of climate change. He has threatened to scupper the Paris environmental deal and questioned the science of global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The choice of Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency has also prompted concern as he is expected to shelve the Obama administration's aggressive enforcement of environmental rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Closer to home, Democrats and labor advocates are worrying about whether the president-elect's pick for labor secretary, Andrew F. Puzder, wants to lead the department or dismantle it. How, they ask, can the head of a company accused of shortchanging workers also be their champion? Will he enforce rules his company, CKE Restaurants, has been accused of violating?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr. Puzder's nomination has already inspired protests, many are also preparing for the Women's March on Washington on Saturday, after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inauguration. The surprising beneficiary has been a bus-booking start-up, Skedaddle, which has seen a surge of people booking to attend the march. The inauguration itself has also been a boon for Airbnb, which has increased its bookings in Washington for the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samsung Leader Faces Arrest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation into President Park Guen-hye of South Korea was already sprawling. Now Samsung, one of the world's largest conglomerates, has been drawn in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jay Y. Lee, the vice chairman of Samsung and the only son of the incapacitated chairman, faces arrest on charges that he tried to bribe the country's president. He is accused of instructing Samsung subsidiaries to make multimillion-dollar donations to the family of Choi Soon-sil, Ms. Park's confidant, and to two foundations controlled by Ms. Choi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mr. Lee is arrested, it will be a landmark step in South Korea's efforts to fight corruption within the country's powerful family-controlled conglomerates, and could disrupt his efforts to inherit management control of Samsung.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quotation of the Day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These days, car companies procure parts around the world now as a matter of course. The important thing is to find a sponsor who can restore Takata's reputation, which won't be easy, and to do it quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Yoshio Tsukuda, the founder of the Tsukuda Mobility Research Institute, an auto industry research firm. After pleading guilty and agreeing to a $1 billion fine, Takata has taken a step toward putting the scandal over its deadly airbags behind it. Now, it is looking for a white knight buyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tax Time</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With tax payments coming up, it's not just taxpayers that are scrambling. Tax-preparation companies are so desperate for business that they are offering money upfront to customers, in anticipation of their tax refund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tax preparers have been hurt by the widespread availability of cheap, sometimes even free, online tax-filing alternatives. Regulators have also clamped down on so-called refund anticipation loans, which the companies have relied on to lure in people who needed cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some investors are unimpressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Morgan Stanley analyst recently downgraded one of these companies, saying that the loans &quot;may be a drag to margins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
