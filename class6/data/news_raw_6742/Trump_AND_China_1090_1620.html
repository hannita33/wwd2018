<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stocks on Wall Street closed broadly lower on Tuesday, as nervous investors continued to monitor the run-up to the 2016 election, which appears to be tightening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newspaper stocks fell as Gannett and Tronc, publisher of The Los Angeles Times, called off a merger. The drug maker Pfizer fell as the company cut its full-year forecast. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Dow Jones industrial average lost 105.32 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 18,037.10. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index lost 14.43 points, or 0.7 percent, closing at 2,111.72, and the Nasdaq composite lost 35.56 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 5,153.58.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Increasingly, investors' focus has been the presidential election. Polls show the race between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appears to have tightened after last week's news that the F.B.I. had discovered new emails that might be relevant to the completed investigation into Mrs. Clinton's private email server.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The narrowing in the race has introduced a new element of uncertainty into financial markets, something that analysts say is likely to keep trading in check.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There were several signs of nervousness in the market. Gold prices rose and the Mexican peso, which has become an indicator of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chances to win, has been falling steadily against the United States dollar since Friday. The peso lost nearly 2 percent against the dollar, a significant move in currency trading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''While Hillary Clinton is still expected to win the final vote, email concerns notwithstanding, next week's outcome could well be too close for comfort,'' said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Notably, the VIX index, a measure of volatility, jumped 14 percent on Tuesday to its highest level since June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The tightening in the polls has gotten the market into a bit of a risk-reduction mode,'' said Thomas L. di Galoma, managing director of Treasury trading at Seaport Global Holdings. ''A week ago it was a Clinton blowout. Now, all of a sudden, it's turning into a bit of a race.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Outside the election, investors will be watching the Federal Reserve, which wraps up a two-day meeting on Wednesday. The nation's central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates stable because of the meeting's proximity to the general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shares of the newspaper company Tronc plunged $1.49, or 12 percent, to $10.54 after Gannett said it would stop its bid to buy the company. Gannett fell 18 cents, or 2 percent, to $7.59.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The spinoff of Yum Brands' operations in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Yum </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Holdings, jumped $1.95, or 8 percent, to $26.19 on its first day of trading. Yum's flagship brand, KFC, has been a success story in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for decades and is by far the largest fast-food franchise in the country. Activist shareholders had pressured Yum to spin off its </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pfizer fell 64 cents, or 2 percent, to $31.07 after the company reported third-quarter profit plunged 38 percent, despite higher sales. The mediocre results missed Wall Street expectations and Pfizer lowered the top end of its 2016 profit forecast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  United States benchmark oil futures fell 19 cents to $46.67 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 47 cents to close at $48.14 a barrel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  United States government bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 1.83 percent. In currency trading, the euro rose to $1.1049 from $1.0975 and the dollar fell to 104.04 yen from 104.85 yen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Precious and industrial metals futures closed broadly higher. Gold climbed $14.90 to $1,286 an ounce, silver rose 62 cents to $18.42 an ounce and copper increased 2 cents to $2.23 a pound.</SPAN></P>
