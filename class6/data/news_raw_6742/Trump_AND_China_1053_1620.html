<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DES MOINES --  The Republican presidential field banded together on Friday against the man they now see as their common enemy, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, whose perceived front-runner status before the Iowa caucuses appeared to grow even more uncertain just three days before the voting begins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As candidates spent the day attacking the senator -- some of them clearly giddy over being free to unleash on a rival they have never had much affection for -- Mr. Cruz responded by sharpening his own attack strategy. He shifted nearly all his negative advertising here from going after Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has overtaken him in recent polls, to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The two freshman senators are locked in a race that is tightening by the day here, with Mr. Rubio gaining on Mr. Cruz in both public polling and internal surveys conducted by both campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Candidates from both parties were in the final sprint before voters here render the first judgment in a presidential race that has so far defied convention, history and neat prediction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Democratic candidates, for their part, also showed the strain from a race that is becoming more combative and competitive by the day. Hillary Clinton issued her sharpest condemnation yet of Senator Bernie Sanders's plan for a single-payer health care system, saying it would thrust the nation into ''a terrible, terrible national debate'' and would ''never, ever come to pass.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it was Mr. Cruz who is absorbing the most incoming fire, and his rivals sought to compound the difficulties he had on Thursday during a debate that left him on the defensive all night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Perhaps the most visible and unfavorable appraisal of Mr. Cruz's recent stumbles here was captured by The Des Moines Register, the state's largest paper, which declared in bold on its Friday front page: ''Rough Night for Cruz.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His fellow Republicans were less kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> piled on, as he is fond of doing when he sees vulnerability in a rival, trying to reinforce the perception that Mr. Cruz fared poorly in the debate and questioning his eligibility to be president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''When you're born in Canada, you're not supposed to be running for president of the United States -- prime minister of Canada, no problem,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said from New Hampshire, where he was campaigning in an attempt to shore up his support in the state's primary, which is a week after Iowa votes. Constitutional scholars have said Mr. Cruz's eligibility to run for president is not in doubt, but that has not stopped Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He got beaten up pretty badly last night,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continued. ''I don't know what's going to happen to his poll numbers, but probably, they're not going up. And I was just told that ours went up because of what we did last night.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whether he harmed his own standing or not by skipping the debate, one thing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> absence did accomplish was to focus everyone's energy on Mr. Cruz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rubio, speaking to reporters on Friday in Muscatine, Iowa, reprised many of his attacks from the debate as he ran through a list of what he said were flip-flops by Mr. Cruz on immigration, energy policy and dealing with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> theft of intellectual property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Oh goodness,'' Mr. Rubio said. ''I mean, the list is endless.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rubio also sought to gamely raise expectations for the Cruz campaign in Iowa, telling Fox News in an interview that the Texas senator is still the front-runner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rubio and his advisers are nonetheless privately rooting for a victory by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which they believe would weaken Mr. Cruz to the point that he is not as formidable a threat. ''He's spent all his money in Iowa,'' Mr. Rubio said. ''He's built what he's called a historic ground game. He says he has 10,000 volunteers.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''So he's put a lot of time and effort here,'' added Mr. Rubio, who hopes to finish a solid third place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At a series of campaign stops, Mr. Cruz betrayed little unease, going after his rivals and tweaking the news media in typical form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Everyone enjoying the campaign trail?'' he said, greeting reporters in Fenton, Iowa. ''I am having a fantastic time.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He shrugged off the Des Moines Register headline about his ''rough night,'' noting he worried little ''about the approval or disapproval of the media.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And he continued expressing disapproval of Republicans he believes lack conservative conviction. ''We've seen too many Republicans who live in the echo chamber of the mainstream media bubble,'' Mr. Cruz said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also reminded Iowans of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> debate choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I was honored to be there,'' he said. ''I think every candidate who's running for president owes it to the men and women of Iowa to show them the respect to come in front of them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The shift in Mr. Cruz's advertising strategy is an abrupt reversal, reflecting the volatility of the race in Iowa: Mr. Cruz's campaign only began airing negative spots against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> this week and just put its first attack ad up against Mr. Rubio on Thursday on Iowa television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The assault on Mr. Rubio will center on his leadership in the Senate's 2013 push to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul, which included what many conservatives call ''amnesty'' for illegal immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Cruz has had to contend with his fair share of attack ads aimed at him here as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His rivals seemed especially irritated that Mr. Cruz has sought to portray himself as the genuine conservative among a group of weak-principled politicians. And Mr. Cruz has found his own political persona under assault as Republicans accuse him of shading his positions, saying one thing before an audience of wealthy donors and then contradicting himself on the campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A ''super PAC'' supporting Mike Huckabee's long-shot bid for the nomination has been running an ad in Iowa that tries to label Mr. Cruz as a hypocrite. ''Just what we need, another phony,'' a woman says.</SPAN></P>
