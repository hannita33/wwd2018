<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clarence, N.Y. -- AMERICANS are angry. I hear it from the former factory workers who lost their jobs to other countries because of bad trade deals, the veterans who wait months to see a doctor at a Veterans Affairs hospital and the small-business owners who are struggling to stay afloat because of the Affordable Care Act's crippling regulations. The professional politicians they trusted and supported have repeatedly sold out our country in favor of special interests and the status quo. Finally, millions of Americans are saying, ''Enough is enough.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I see the failures of career politicians in the experiences of the hardworking men and women in Western New York whom I represent in Congress. The safe manufacturer SentrySafe, which once employed hundreds in the Rochester area, will close its doors this June and shift much of its operation to Mexico. That means the loss of good-paying jobs because our state and national leaders do not know how to encourage businesses to stay and grow in the United States. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  America cannot afford another professional politician residing in the White House. We need a leader who has faced tough real-life situations before, and won. As Republicans prepare to vote in the New York primary on Tuesday, I hope they will send a resounding message that they believe Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is that type of leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over the past several decades, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has built a family business into a network of highly successful enterprises. One of the many reasons Americans are rallying behind him is his record of success and commitment to taking the lessons he's learned to the White House. When he talks about being a president who would create jobs, win negotiations and stand up to enemies, people believe him because he has done it before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To fix the mistakes made by President Obama, our next president needs to speak frankly about the problems that exist, explain how he or she will correct them and have the fortitude to take necessary actions, no matter how unpopular they would be with Washington elites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yes, being a blunt-spoken political outsider gets a nominee only so far. But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continues to win because his message and his ideas for fixing America are resonating with voters. He is committed to securing our borders, taking back the manufacturing jobs that have been stolen from the middle class by Mexico and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and standing up to enemies threatening our way of life. These are things people in my district care about. His demand that foreign countries stop cheating on international trade is especially welcome in Western New York, a region devastated by the North American Free Trade Agreement and other poorly negotiated trade deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even some of his supporters don't agree with everything he says. I believe his plan to deport the 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States is unfeasible, and his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering our country will not end radical Islamic terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, there is something to be said for a candidate who is willing to put forward proposals to protect our nation, rather than skirt uncomfortable issues -- as President Obama and Hillary Clinton all too often do. His lack of political correctness shows that he is independent and understands the things people care about. Unlike career politicians who take policy positions based on their fear of losing elections or angering deep-pocketed special interests, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is accountable to no one but the voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Republicans recognize that the remaining Republican candidates have all advanced conservative solutions to the problems our nation is facing, as evidenced by the record voter turnout we have seen. But while Senator Ted Cruz and Gov. John Kasich both have strong visions, neither possesses Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proven negotiating skills or ability to enact real change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I know firsthand how important Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> private-sector know-how is to improving the way government operates. I spent my career buying and rebuilding distressed companies, which created and saved hundreds of middle-class jobs. I put that experience to use in 2007 when I ran for executive of Erie County, a region that had been devastated by losses in manufacturing jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In office, I made the necessary tough choices and turned a nearly bankrupt, debt-ridden county into one with a surplus. I believe Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will achieve the same results for America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Americans have a chance to set our country back on course and restore the possibility of the American dream for our children and grandchildren. For too long the political class has denied everyday Americans a real voice in government. This election, voters are finding a leader who is listening to them over the clamor of Washington special interests, and voters are speaking loud and clear. They want a leader like Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; a chief executive, not a chief politician.</SPAN></P>
