<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIRUT, Lebanon -- The United Nations special envoy to Syria offered unsolicited advice on Monday to President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: Pay attention to what happens between now and January in Syria, particularly in Aleppo, the storied city at risk of obliteration by Russian-backed Syrian forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The envoy, Staffan de Mistura, suggested that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shared desire with Russia to collaborate to annihilate the Islamist militants ensconced in eastern Aleppo and elsewhere presented new circumstances that could alter the war -- for better or worse. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While such a collaboration could be effective in eradicating the Islamic State, Mr. de Mistura said during an interview in Beirut, the carnage and destruction caused by the Syrian and Russian militaries in Syria increasingly make it more problematic politically for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to align with Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. de Mistura's remarks, after a weekend of frustrating diplomacy in Syria, represented the first time that he had spoken about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> potential role in the war through the president-elect's eagerness to work with Russia, which backs the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Russia desires a new approach with the incoming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration on Syria, Mr. de Mistura said, ''it could be difficult for any president in the United States, regardless of his own priorities, to ignore the international outrage'' over the ''humanitarian tragedy in Aleppo.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Unless drastic steps are taken, Mr. de Mistura said, ''eastern Aleppo will not be there by the new year in terms of structural destruction.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For now, the Syrian government's apparent determination to eradicate the anti-government insurgents in eastern Aleppo appears to have overwhelmed all other considerations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the bombing of Aleppo abated during Mr. de Mistura's visit to Damascus on Saturday and Sunday, it resumed as he was departing on Monday. Humanitarian agencies have pleaded for respite from the assaults, which they say have destroyed or incapacitated all hospitals in the rebel-held part of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the United Nations on Monday, the organization's top relief official told the Security Council that he was ''more or less at my wit's end as a human being'' about the suffering in Aleppo and other besieged parts of Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are not just seeing a resumption of violence in Aleppo -- this is not business as usual,'' said the relief official, Stephen O'Brien, the under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator. ''What has been unleashed on civilians this past week is yet another low in an unrelenting inhuman onslaught.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. de Mistura went to Syria with a short-term proposal to help civilians in Aleppo, which included the evacuation of about 200 wounded people at risk of dying because their injuries cannot be treated in a war zone; the delivery of medical supplies; and food aid for the most vulnerable. The emergency plan would also allow doctors, who have been working around the clock, to rotate out for rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Syrian government rejected all tenets of Mr. de Mistura's plan except the evacuation of the wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. de Mistura has also proposed asking the fighters who are part of the Nusra Front, the Al Qaeda affiliate operating in Syria, to voluntarily leave east Aleppo to allow aid deliveries for the civilians there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Syria's foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, has rejected that proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. de Mistura nonetheless believes the Russians are sympathetic to his ideas for Aleppo, he said, because they do not want to be seen as helping to destroy the historic city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In articles quoting Russian sources and disseminated by the Russian-based Sputnik news agency and by a Chinese newspaper, Russia has sent decidedly mixed messages about its intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the Sputnik articles, the officials criticized the United Nations for having failed to use a pause in the Aleppo bombing this fall to evacuate wounded people. The articles also said traces of chlorine and white phosphorus bombs had been found in attacks on government-held western Aleppo. If true, the claims would suggest rebels are using banned weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Assad's forces have also been accused of using banned weapons, including by a United Nations panel of inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People's Daily newspaper has asserted that Russia is not participating in the bombing, suggesting that as Mr. de Mistura indicated, Russia does not want to be associated with the flattening of Aleppo and untold civilian casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The newspaper also suggested that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election victory might factor into what it described as Russia's reluctance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''At this stage Russia all the more does not want any trouble with regard to civilian casualties on the Syrian battlefield and other issues that could complicate bilateral relations,'' the newspaper said.</SPAN></P>
