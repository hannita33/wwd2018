</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, laying out his economic plan on Monday in Detroit, said that the nation must ''stop relying on the tired voices of the past.'' In what would seem to be yet another jab at Hillary Clinton, he added, ''We can't fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps that's the best explanation for his recently released list of economic advisers -- a list that has caused a bit of head-scratching in financial circles, given that it is largely devoid of names of heavyweight economists who have backed Republican party nominees in years past. (And entirely devoid of women.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, his economic circle -- as he promised -- is a bit, shall we say, less typical. The prominent of the not-so-prominent list of economists includes only one Ph.D., Peter Navarro, a professor at the University of California, Irvine and longtime opponent of free trade who blames </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for America's economic ills; Stephen Moore, a flat-tax advocate who co-founded the anti-tax group Club for Growth; and David Malpass, a consultant and former chief economist at Bear Stearns.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The group is heavy on moguls and would-be moguls -- all, of course, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> donors. Among them are Steven Roth, a real estate mogul who owns a building with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; Harold Hamm, the billionaire wildcatter; John A. Paulson, the billionaire hedge fund manager; Steve Feinberg, the co-founder of Cerberus, the private equity firm; and Dan DiMicco, former president and chief executive of the steel company Nucor Corporation, who has been vocal about bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Wilbur Ross, the famed venture capitalist, was left off the original list but later added on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> website; Mr. Ross said that his team hadn't gotten back to the candidate in time to be included last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And for those keeping score, Carl Icahn, the activist investor and longtime </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> backer, said he was left off the list so he could start a ''super PAC,'' which he said would not be allowed if he were a formal member of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then again, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has made a virtue of his lack of traditional support, depicting himself as an anti-establishment candidate willing to make difficult choices. He sent a tweet saying as much earlier this week, showing a picture of him and Ms. Clinton under the headline ''Campaign Contributions from Hedge Funds.'' It showed Ms. Clinton received $48.5 million from the hedge fund industry while Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> received only $19,000. ''Crooked Hillary Clinton is 100% owned by her donors,'' he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tweet and his economics council are a bit of mixed message, given that he is trying to raise money from the financial industry and clearly has some support -- even some from traditional Republican circles. On Monday, for instance, George P. Bush, the son of Jeb (who is anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> came out in favor of the Republican candidate, urging all party members to support Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> challenge is he is trying to be two things at the same time: distinctly anti-elite yet absolutely elite. This is particularly tough given he wants to be seen as a successful billionaire businessman while also being an outsider trying to work for the little guy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That said, while Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may relish his unconventional group, he has been quietly trying to get some more establishment voices to join him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But many of the most prominent Republican donors have been doing their best to avoid associating with him. Stephen Schwarzman, co-founder of the Blackstone Group, met with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but has so far refused to donate or publicly support him, according to people briefed on the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Henry Kravis, who historically has voted for Republicans and donated money to them, has been relatively silent. (When Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> floated his name for Treasury secretary, Mr. Kravis said, ''That was scary when he said that.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ken Griffin, the founder of Citadel, would seem like a natural </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporter, given that he describes himself as a ''Reagan Republican.'' He has donated to Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker, but not to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cliff Asness, the billionaire founder of AQR, an investment management firm, has historically supported Republicans, but called Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''a disaster for the G.O.P. and for the country.'' In March, he seemed to bend a little, saying, ''I have to keep a more open mind,'' but his spokesman said on Monday that he hadn't changed his position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Paul Singer, one of the biggest Republican donors, has been part of the #NeverTrump campaign, saying his policies would be ''a guarantee of a global depression.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The list goes on. Seth Klarman, who runs the hedge fund Baupost, has often supported Republicans even though he is an independent. Last week he issued a blistering statement about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while throwing his weight behind Mrs. Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''His words and actions over the last several days are so shockingly unacceptable in our diverse and democratic society that it is simply unthinkable that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could become our president,'' Mr. Klarman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Traditional Republican economists have also kept their distance. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, wrote, ''The anti-trade and anti-immigration policies of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> portend a slower-growth future for all Americans, and middle- and lower-income Americans in particular.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Greg Mankiw, a Harvard economist who succeeded Mr. Hubbard as chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers and also advised Mitt Romney, said of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: ''He will not be getting my vote. I have Republican friends who think that things couldn't be worse than doubling down on Obama policies under Hillary Clinton. And, like them, I am no fan of the left's agenda of large government and high taxes. But they are wrong: Things could be worse. And I fear they would be under Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ross, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporter, said he thought the candidate's economic speech in Detroit on Monday might prove to be a positive turning point. ''He did a very good job,'' Mr. Ross said after the speech. ''If he just stuck to that, he'd be in a lot better shape.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ross called Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''substantive'' and said he was particularly impressed by ''the whole way he reacted to the staged demonstrators.'' It was ''mature'' of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to refrain from taking the bait and getting angry, Mr. Ross said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The question is, if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> adjusts his behavior over the next several weeks, will some of those establishment names come join his anti-establishment band?</SPAN></P>
