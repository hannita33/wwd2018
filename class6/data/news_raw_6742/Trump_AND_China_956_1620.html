</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Berlin Christmas market where 12 people died Monday night was the target of a terrorist attack, Chancellor Angela Merkel said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police searched a refugee shelter at Tempelhof airport as part of their investigation into the attack. A man suspected of driving the truck into the crowded market is in custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public spaces can no longer be presumed to be safe, and that includes the Christmas markets that flourish across much of Europe this time of year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Russia's ambassador to Turkey was assassinated by a lone Turkish gunman, described by officials as an off-duty police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the attack, captured in this video (warning: graphic scenes), the gunman shouted &quot;don't forget Aleppo, don't forget Syria!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no indication so far that the two countries will alter their policies towardthe war in Syria. Turkish, Russian and Iranian officials will meet in Moscow today to discuss the future of the Syrian city of Aleppo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hours earlier, the United Nations passed a resolution to observe the evacuation of tens of thousands of civilians from Aleppo. Russia signed on only after a compromise that could allow Syrian soldiers and allied Shiite militias to block the monitors' access.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the civilians saved is a 7-year-old girl, above, whose Twitter posts describing life during wartime have drawn comparisons to Anne Frank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Monetary Fund endorsed its leader, Christine Lagarde, despite her conviction in a French court on criminal charges of negligence related to the misuse of public funds. The judge declined to impose a fine or jail time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are the basics of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Republicans in Texas applauded as their electors pushed Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> past the 270-vote threshold in the Electoral College, affirming him as the 45th president of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A concerted effort by opponents, including protests in many state capitols, failed to persuade electors to revolt against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Spanish restaurant chain's business model: Use revenue made by serving breakfast and lunch to cover the costs of free dinners for homeless people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vivendi, the French media conglomerate, intensified its battle for control of Mediaset, the Italian broadcaster founded by the former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kering, the French luxury-good group, announced a minimum of 14 weeks of paid maternity or adoptive leave - across all brands and all locations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The founder of Blued, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most popular gay dating app, is a former police officer who secretly ran a website for gay people for 16 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wall Street forecasters are delivering their market predictions for the coming year - which our columnist reminds to take with more than a grain of salt. Remember 2008? Stocks were supposed to be great that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Zurich, a gunman opened fire in a Muslim prayer center, wounding at least three people. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scotland will set out proposals today for how it could continue being part of the European Union's single market after Britain exits the bloc. [The Guardian]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Russian agreement with Austria's far-right Freedom Party is the latest sign that the Kremlin is forging bonds with political parties across Europe. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Siberian city of Irkutsk, at least 49 people died after drinking bath lotion containing methanol as a substitute for alcohol. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Norway and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> normalized diplomatic ties, which deteriorated when the Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New legislation in the U.S. is expected to worsen the water wars among farmers, fishing industries and environmentalists. [The Associated Press]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Year in News. The U.S. presidential election and the candidates were popular subjects for Times readers this year, but our most-read article, like last year, was about love. Here's the full list - with a &quot;no politics&quot; option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roger Federer, the great, balletic Swiss tennis player, discussed his comeback plans. &quot;I think the beginning of the year, especially the Australian summer, is going to be epic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pregnancy alters the size and structure ofa woman's brain in ways that may make it easier to recognize an infant's needs, researchers say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Restorers in Belgium removed overpainting from the 15th-century Ghent Altarpiece, revealing for the first time in hundreds of years the original brush strokes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And did you know that the average age in Kosovo is under 30? No wonder the city of Pristina has a youthful, vibrant vibe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When is a phone call like a diplomatic life preserver?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you're Taiwan, and on the other end of the line is President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the first American leader to speak to you in 37 years. Above, President Tsai Ing-wen during the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you are small and fighting a much bigger adversary,&quot; a diplomat from Taiwan told The Times a few months ago, &quot;you had better use your wisdom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> considers the island, ruled by Nationalists who fled the Communist takeover in 1949, a renegade province. So when the U.S. and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opened diplomatic relations in 1979, the U.S. had to cut off Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might and markets grew, most other countries followed suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taiwan is now recognized by just 22 countries, mostly tiny island nations in the Caribbean and Pacific swayed by Taipei's aid packages. Two years ago, a former Guatemalan leader admitted to accepting bribes from Taiwan for diplomatic recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taiwan's last ally in Europe is the Vatican. But there, too, officials have made overtures toward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which has a vigorous, if partly underground, Catholic community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, Nicaragua remains with Taiwan. But it may be swayed: A mainland Chinese company has pledged to create a transoceanic shipping route through it, to rival the Panama Canal.</SPAN></P>
