<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WEST CHESTER, Ohio -- Get live updates about the Ohio primary and other contests on March 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unsettled by images of violence and ugliness at Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies, the Republican leaders pushing to stop him are desperately targeting voters in the five big states that vote on Tuesday. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The weekend of disturbances at Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies injected more unease into the race, and the appeals of his rivals turned emotional and urgent. On Sunday, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida warned that a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White House would exploit hatred and stir violence. ''Imagine what that means for the country,'' Mr. Rubio said. ''Imagine the tone it sets for our culture.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ohio has emerged as a critical contest, the one large state voting this week where Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appears vulnerable. A victory here by Gov. John Kasich would complicate Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attempt to gather a majority of delegates needed for the nomination.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont hoped for a repeat of his stunning upset over Hillary Clinton last week in Michigan, as he hopscotched the Midwest to push his central message that American workers have suffered too much under trade deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although the states that voted two weeks ago on ''Super Tuesday'' received much attention, the contests this week are potentially even more important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A total of 424 delegates are up for grabs on the Republican side, and, for the first time, states can award all of their delegates to the winner of the popular vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With two polls in recent days showing Mr. Kasich with an edge over Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Ohio, whose 66 delegates will be awarded winner-take-all on Tuesday, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made multiple stops in the state over the weekend and added a last-minute return visit on Monday, canceling an appearance in Florida, where he has a strong lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> held two rallies on Sunday that were mainly free of protesters' disturbances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The unrest at Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies has made the race more tense. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> blamed Mr. Sanders's supporters for shutting down a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally on Friday in Chicago. But he has been sympathetic to his supporters who have become violent. On Sunday, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he would consider paying the legal costs for a man who was charged last week with assaulting a protester being escorted from a rally in Fayetteville, N.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In West Chester, Ohio, on Sunday, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke on a raised platform surrounded by a cordon of uniformed and plainclothes officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Mr. Kasich is defeated in Ohio, he has indicated he will exit the race. Mr. Rubio is likely to withdraw, too, if he loses his home state, Florida. That would leave Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> facing Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in a head-to-head competition, and polls show Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is weaker in that matchup than in a multicandidate field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Cruz, who is well behind in the polls in Ohio and Florida, focused on the other three states voting on Tuesday: Missouri, North Carolina and Illinois, where he planned to hold five events on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Cruz said he was ''neck and neck'' with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the three states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the Democratic campaign, aides to Mrs. Clinton predicted tight races in the Midwestern states, where economically struggling voters have gravitated to Mr. Sanders. They were optimistic about winning Florida and North Carolina, where black, Hispanic and older voters were expected to give Mrs. Clinton a healthy edge in the race for delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sanders has linked Mrs. Clinton, in speeches and a television ad, to Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago, whose record on policing and fights with public-sector unions are unpopular with progressive voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Missouri on Sunday, Mr. Sanders told a crowd that he had, ''from Day 1, been a leader in opposition to these disastrous trade policies.'' He added, ''Secretary Clinton has supported virtually all of them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With Mr. Sanders's ads attacking her support of global trade deals, Mrs. Clinton has emphasized her proposals to lift employment while criticizing the Vermont senator for being short on specific plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Speaking at a factory in Youngstown, Ohio, over the weekend, Mrs. Clinton vowed to end steel-dumping practices by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other nations that undermine the economy in the industrial Mahoning Valley. ''I have always been committed to bringing back manufacturing,'' she said. ''And I'm the only candidate, on either side, who actually has a plan to do that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With Ohio a perennial swing state in presidential elections, and its racially and economically diverse voters fiercely fought over, it was no surprise that candidates converged here in the final hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attacked Mr. Kasich for his support of the Common Core education standards, for a private-sector job at Lehman Brothers, whose 2008 collapse Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said ''almost destroyed the world,'' and for supporting trade deals that he blamed for harming the manufacturing sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kasich accused Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of creating ''a toxic atmosphere'' and said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was on the verge of disqualifying himself to represent the party because of his divisive speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The world's eyes were glued to the scenes of mayhem and discord Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has created, Mr. Kasich said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Our enemies are going to take advantage of them,'' Mr. Kasich told voters near Cleveland. ''Our friends are scratching their heads saying, 'What the heck is happening in America?' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kasich, who has boasted of bringing 400,000 jobs to Ohio and has visited businesses that opened under his watch, has marshaled nearly the entire elected Republican apparatus of Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Monday, Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee who has been an outspoken critic of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, will appear with Mr. Kasich at two Ohio rallies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Matt Borges, chairman of the state Republicans, warned that if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was the nominee, his divisiveness would cost Republicans the state in the general election. ''If we don't carry Ohio in the fall, we don't elect a Republican to the White House,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally here was in West Chester, the hometown of John Boehner, the former House speaker who resigned last year out of frustration with the no-compromise wing of House Republicans. In a rare public appearance, Mr. Boehner endorsed Mr. Kasich at a county Republican dinner in West Chester on Saturday. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally on Sunday, just a few miles away, was attended by many hundreds more people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Kasich's done a great job with Ohio,'' said Doug Mason, a concrete laborer, but he still planned to vote for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''I think </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be John Kasich on steroids.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The town-hall-style event for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was most notable for his response to a man who said it was important ''for a lot of veterans in Ohio'' that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> clarify a comment, made last year, that former prisoners of war like Senator John McCain were not heroes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Oh no, no, no,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. ''They are real heroes.''</SPAN></P>
