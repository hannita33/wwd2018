That&amp;#8217;s not the level of precision we&amp;#8217;re striving for. Here are a few recent misfires. <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too often we use a word that sounds sort of like what we probably mean, more or less. That's not the level of precision we're striving for. If you're not absolutely sure you've got the right word, you probably don't. Look it up!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few recent misfires:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Reuters article on Tuesday shed new light on the Pentagon's obstinance on Guant&aacute;namo and the extent to which the department has sought to keep detainees locked away for years without due process in a prison established to sidestep the Constitution and international law. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This isn't a word. A good clue is the fact that the adjective is &quot;obstinate,&quot; not &quot;obstinant.&quot; The noun is &quot;obstinacy&quot; or, less often, &quot;obstinateness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [Opinion] </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seems to feel absolutely no compunction to explain how anything would work. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Compunction&quot; means a feeling of guilt or regret. Certainly one might say </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> feels no compunction about some of the controversial things he has said or done. But here we meant something more like &quot;compulsion,&quot; or, better, &quot;obligation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But her own children said it was her role as mother that she seemed to covet most. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a colleague pointed out, &quot;covet&quot; means to long for something you don't have, or that belongs to someone else. That's not the case here. We meant something more like &quot;value&quot; or perhaps &quot;cherish.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is difficult to understate how big Saudi Aramco is believed to be. Its stated oil reserves amount to 261 billion barrels, more than 10 times those of Exxon Mobil. It supplies roughly a tenth of the world's oil. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This common error is more a misunderstanding of the idiom than of the word itself. We should say &quot;difficult to overstate&quot; - that is, Saudi Aramco is so large that it would be hard to exaggerate its size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Film aficionados tend to find the fact-checking of movies a feckless exercise. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This may be a closer call. But the context suggests we meant something more like &quot;pointless,&quot; rather than &quot;feckless,&quot; which can mean either weak or careless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> When Spell-Check Can't Help </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple of familiar, and painful, homonym mix-ups from recent stories:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has also failed in its efforts to reign in Mr. Kim. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, this was quickly fixed to read &quot;rein in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The office released a photo of Mr. Couch, his blond hair, and red beard and mustache, died dark brown. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dyed,&quot; of course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Pro and Con </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Advocate&quot; means to speak or work in favor of something. So it's ungainly, even illogical, to use this word in describing opposition - it's like saying someone is in favor of being against something. Yet versions of this crop up fairly often. For example:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In May, he beatified &Oacute;scar Romero, the archbishop of San Salvador who was assassinated in 1980 after advocating fervently against poverty, social injustice and torture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How about &quot;campaigning fervently against&quot; or &quot;working fervently against&quot; or perhaps &quot;fervently fighting poverty, etc.&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Gandy, the anti-domestic-violence advocate, said she was not surprised that the Yankees had made such a calculated decision to trade for Chapman. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An awkward description: someone who is for being against domestic violence.  Rephrase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> In a Word </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet so far this season, there is just one more foul per game compared to last - which, accounting for the extra possessions, is essentially no change at all. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As The Times's stylebook says, &quot;compare to&quot; means to liken. Here we wanted &quot;compared with&quot; - or, better, just say &quot;one more foul per game than last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the day of Russia's 2011 parliamentary election, coordinated counterattacks crashed the websites of much of the country's liberal media outlets. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make it &quot;many ... outlets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Infants with the defect, called gastroschisis, are born with intestines poking out of a hole in the abdominal wall. Other organs, like the stomach and liver, may also be found outside the body at birth. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reader points out that a pronouncer would have been helpful with this unfamiliar term. (It's apparently gas-TROSS-kuh-sis.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [Editorial] Until the state or the city comes up with money to pay for lawyers who the Constitution requires the government to provide, these people, including Ms. Kennedy, are locked up in jail without lawyers to challenge their arrests, request reduced bail or file motions to preserve evidence. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make it &quot;whom,&quot; the object of &quot;provide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Worries about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> health is weighing on oil. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plural subject &quot;worries&quot; needs a plural verb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This month, El Salvador said it was seeing a surge in Guillain-Barr&eacute; cases. It normally averages about 14 per month, but between Dec. 1, 2015, and Jan. 6, 2016, it recorded 46, of which two had died. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Which&quot; refers to &quot;cases,&quot; so &quot;had died&quot; doesn't work. We could just say &quot;46, two of them fatal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wilkes Bashford, a clothier whose eponymous emporium is famous for having dressed affluent, elegance-conscious San Franciscans for the last half-century, died on Saturday at his home in San Francisco. He was 82. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we've often noted - and as the stylebook explains - in precise usage &quot;eponymous&quot; describes the giver of the name, not the recipient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> [Opinion] If either of these narratives are true, then Clinton's sex life will be a non-issue in 2016. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Either&quot; is singular, so make it &quot;either ... is.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year he hiked and camped in Isle Royale National Park in Lake Superior; and MacNaughton Mountain (no relation) in the Adirondacks; canoed on the Androscoggin River in New Hampshire; and backpacked the Wonderland Trail around Mount Rainier in Washington with Fitpacking, an adventure travel company. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We tried to use semicolons to tame this overstuffed sentence, but they don't really work. Try again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democrats pushed back against the idea that a vote should be invalidated just because a person did not register a written change of address. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's try harder to resist this overused expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Washington is not a snow town,&quot; former Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. once famously said, and with forecasters predicting a mid-Atlantic weekend storm of historic proportions, with the capital as its center, officials and citizens here and across the region are scurrying to prepare. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one of those journalese tics that we could easily do without, with no loss to the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you look only at the global economy, and what leading forecasters think it will do in 2016, things look to be in a reasonably solid state. The world economy will grow 3.4 percent this year, economists at the International Monetary Fund projected this week, up from 3.1 percent in 2015. Private sector forecasters mostly have similar expectations. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you look only at global financial markets, it's Aaack, Run for the Hills! The Sky is Falling! </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This passage is bright and effective, but the capitalization is baffling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though competition between the five remains fierce - and each year, a few of them seem up and a few down - it's becoming harder to picture how any one of them, let alone two or three, may cede their growing clout in every aspect of American business and society. ...  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even with these difficulties, it's unclear if the larger dynamic may change much. Let's say that Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, eclipses Amazon's retail business in India - well, O.K., so then it satisfies itself with the rest of the world. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither of these &quot;mays&quot; is right. Make it &quot;will cede&quot; (or possibly &quot;would cede&quot;) and &quot;will change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Matthew Hutchinson was among the two people killed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Among&quot; isn't right for just two. Say &quot;was one of the two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's all very exciting, eh? But still ... Canada? The land of hyper-politeness and constant apology? The home of maple syrup, poutine, the gentle sport of curling and 10 percent of the world's forests? The country that Spy magazine once said had &quot;cultural Epstein-Barrness&quot;? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putting aside the rest of the stereotypes, can we at least agree never again to use &quot;eh?&quot; in a joking reference to Canadians?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Google has made strong inroads in schools, reporting recently that its free software program for classrooms, called Google Apps for Education, was now used by more than 50 million students, teachers and administrators worldwide. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Program&quot; is redundant after &quot;software.&quot;</SPAN></P>
