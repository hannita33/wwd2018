</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction Appended</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No security clearance is coming for Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or Jared Kushner in a Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition or administration, sources say, as Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York meets with the president-elect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daughter and son-in-law are not seeking a security clearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> daughter, nor her husband, Jared Kushner, has applied for a security clearance, nor do they intend to, according to two people close to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the long back-and-forth over whether Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family would get top-secret security clearances, Kellyanne Conway seemed to tip her hand on Wednesday - at least regarding Mr. Kushner.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's appropriate for whoever's going to get the presidential daily briefing to have a security clearance,&quot; Ms. Conway, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign manager, said. &quot;It's not just appropriate, necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But transition officials said Mr. Kushner had not sat in any security briefings and had no plans to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kushner - the son of a New Jersey developer and convicted criminal, and the owner of the newspaper The New York Observer - has no background in national security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conway: You're all wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meeting with the news media in the lobby of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower, Ms. Conway on Wednesday denied, well, everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign in disarray? &quot;I just don't see it that way. It's just not that way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did the president-elect mislead reporters on Tuesday night when he slipped out for dinner at the &quot;21&quot; Club?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No. He was just having dinner with his family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hold a news conference?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shortly, I would say. Sometime soon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been just over a week since the election, and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has made only two appointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't form a federal government overnight, and these are very serious issues, very serious appointments, very serious considerations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade: The issue that shall not be named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A U.S. Chamber of Commerce board meeting was jolted Wednesday morning by a visit from Vice President-elect Mike Pence, whose running mate crossed swords with the business group over trade agreements during the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Big Business was hoping for an olive branch, Mr. Pence was not forthcoming. Mr. Pence appeared at 10 a.m. and told the group of about 75 attendees that the administration's focus would be on &quot;economic growth,&quot; according to one attendee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there was one word he did not mention: trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chamber is a vocal proponent of international trade agreements, especially the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the huge trade accord secured by President Obama and vilified by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nikki Haley for secretary of state?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new name emerged as a possible choice for secretary of state on Wednesday - Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, a Republican who backed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the Republican primaries and who spoke against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> incendiary language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources tell me Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is now considering Governor Nikki Haley for Secretary of State. - Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) November 16, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those close to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had mentioned Ms. Haley in passing during the vice-presidential hunt this year, but considered her damaged by her opposition to the nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has told friends that he is keeping his own list of names for cabinet posts, and that they should pay little mind to what they read in the newspapers or see on television about transition planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Jamie Dimon for Treasury?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The on-again-off-again romance with Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, to be Treasury secretary seems to be back on, at least according to Maria Bartiromo of the Fox Business Network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hearing @jpmorgan ceo jamie Dimon will get treasury secy job. Big meeting tomorrow @MorningsMaria@FoxBusiness will discuss tmrw - Maria Bartiromo (@MariaBartiromo) November 16, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Blasio to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: People are scared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, in an hourlong session with President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - a man Mr. de Blasio once called uniquely unqualified for the presidency - cautioned Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against large-scale deportations and what the mayor characterized as divisive language and policies that have heightened fears among New Yorkers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ball's in his court,&quot; Mr. de Blasio said outside </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in Manhattan, at a news conference Wednesday after the meeting. &quot;People in the city and all over the country are looking to see what he's going to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing a rise of anti-Semitism in the city, he added, &quot;Part of why I think it's so important to remind the president-elect and his team that there are deep fears and concerns out there is because the wrong messages can encourage hateful acts. So, I certainly made clear that I think sending a message of unity is crucial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signaling a conservative Supreme Court justice?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the items on the president-elect's to-do list is to find someone to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated by the death of Antonin Scalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that end, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> met on Wednesday with Leonard Leo, the executive vice president of the Federalist Society, a group that advocates a conservative and libertarian approach to the law. Mr. Leo said the president-elect seemed committed to picking someone who cares &quot;very deeply about the rule of law and about the preservation of our Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's looking for someone who is independent, courageous, smart, very high quality,&quot; Mr. Leo told reporters, adding that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remained committed to choosing one of the 21 court prospects he circulated during the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Leo said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had not revealed a timeline for announcing a pick for the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> message at '21' Club: I'll lower your taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect dined at the &quot;21&quot; Club in Manhattan on Tuesday night out of reporters' earshot. But what did he say? He was promising a group of well-heeled patrons that he would lower their taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll get your taxes down-don't worry about it&quot; POTUS-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tells diners at NYC's 21 Club-via @HallieJackson who made a rez to get in pic.twitter.com/0IcEYXq7SW - Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) November 16, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some patrons laughed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who lives on Fifth Avenue, campaigned as a champion of the middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Mnuchin, a member of the transition team executive committee and possible pick for Treasury secretary, fleshed out that agenda, telling reporters on Wednesday morning that he and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had &quot;talked about taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the other thing - very big focus - is regulatory changes, looking at the creation of an infrastructure bank to fund infrastructure investments,&quot; he said. &quot;So, there's a lot of things to do, and I'd say the economic priorities are clearly taxes, regulatory, trade and infrastructure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: We didn't invent climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese climate change negotiators in Marrakesh, Morocco, delivered a response to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2012 Twitter post that claimed:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. - Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liu Zhenmin, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> deputy minister of foreign affairs and lead negotiator at this United Nations summit meeting, told reporters, &quot;Climate change is not, as rumored, a hoax created by the Chinese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you look at the history of climate change negotiations, it was initiated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change with the support of Republicans in both the Reagan and Bush administrations in the late '80s and early '90s,&quot; Mr. Liu added. &quot;So I hope that Republicans will continue to support this process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Marrakesh negotiations are a follow-up to the passage of last year's Paris Agreement, committing nearly 200 countries to take action to curb global warming. President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has slammed the deal and suggested that he would withdraw the United States from it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is emerging in Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wake as a new leader in efforts to curb global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever position the U.S. puts forth, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will continue to support the Paris agreement,&quot; Mr. Liu said.</SPAN></P>
