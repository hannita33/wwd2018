<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who gains from a trade war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Peru over the weekend, one of the biggest questions was whether Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as the next president, would stick to his threat to erect steep trade barriers against Beijing, dragging the United States into a tit-for-tat confrontation with the world's second-largest economy. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No such war has begun, yet it seems clear that the United States has already lost. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been steadily gaining in the global economic system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Waging war against globalization, America is making </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> case. Eswar Prasad, a former head of the Chinese division at the International Monetary Fund, argues that ''over the long term </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comes out a winner no matter what.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economy would surely suffer if the United States were to impose a 45 percent tariff on nearly $500 billion worth of Chinese imports. The United States absorbs only 16 percent of Chinese exports, but it is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> healthiest export market. Fears of American protectionism are already stoking capital flight from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might be better placed than the United States to take the blow. And it would certainly counterpunch. An editorial in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Global Times, a Communist Party mouthpiece, is probably not far off in its warning that American action would mean: ''A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has several ways to retaliate. It could bar state-owned companies from doing business with American businesses. It could limit access to essential commodities, as it did in response to a fishing dispute with Japan by stopping exports of so-called rare earth minerals essential to the electronics industry. It could soft-pedal efforts to combat the piracy of American patents and copyrights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of the United States' most successful companies would be in for a rough ride. Most of Apple's iPhones, for example, are assembled in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The assembly costs, though, account for less than 4 percent of the value added of the device. That means </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could force a halt in iPhone production at little cost to itself, while Apple would face a deeply disruptive, expensive effort to shift production elsewhere. Building it from scratch in the United States is nearly impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  How long could American resolve hold? An analysis by the pro-trade Peterson Institute for International Economics concluded that a full-blown trade war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mexico would push unemployment in the United States to nearly 9 percent in 2020, from 4.9 percent today. That would not improve the economic outlook for millions of working-class Americans in whose name Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposed this fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And that may not even be the worst part. Circling the wagons around the American border plays directly into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hands in other ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Washington would be cast as the villain in the fight. No matter how many tricks the Chinese government might deploy against American interests, it would remain the victim in the eyes of many nations, a champion for the cause of open rules-based trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is just bluffing, as many of his allies say, to gain leverage in some future negotiation, much of the damage has been done. His bluster has changed the perception of the role the United States will play in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the face of a turn toward populist nationalism in other rich countries -- like Britain and France -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has emerged in the unlikely role of defender of globalized capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the one major power still talking about increased integration,'' said Nicholas Lardy, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> specialist at the Peterson Institute. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the only major country in the world projecting the idea that globalization brings benefits.'' And that is the United States' loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A great many countries in the developing world still believe prosperity depends on their successful integration into the supply chains that traverse the global economy. By turning inward -- a move already reinforced by the rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- the United States appears to have little to offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steven Ciobo, Australia's trade minister, conveyed that point only a few days after the American election by saying that his nation would work to conclude the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership -- a Chinese initiative among 16 Asian and Pacific countries that excludes the United States -- and would support Beijing's proposed Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific. Ditto for Peru and Chile, which, according to a senior Chinese official in Lima, are also now seeking to join the Chinese trade initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Almost certainly every economy in the Asian region sees its future lying more closely linked with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' Mr. Prasad, the former I.M.F. official, told me. ''With </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> talking about withdrawing from trade deals and making allies pay for protection, it will be tough for Asian countries to resist </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> embrace.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And if Washington's actions against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> start to disrupt Asia's supply chains, the United States could quickly become the region's economic pariah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The question is, to what purpose? It can't simply be about stopping currency manipulation. That's an outdated fear. Instead of working to lower the value of its currency to improve its exports, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has spent about $1 trillion lately to prop up the value of the renminbi in the face of capital flight. If it stopped, the currency would drop like a stone, enhancing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade competitiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moreover, slapping trade barriers against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would do little to narrow the American trade deficit. American companies building things in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wouldn't bring much manufacturing home; in most cases they would go to some other country with cheap labor. And to the extent they did ''reshore'' production, most of it would be highly automated, employing few additional Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It does not make economic sense for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to want to balance trade with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' said Derek Scissors, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ''Balanced trade doesn't bring back jobs.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Initially, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might look like a winner, resolute in his defense of the working class. But any increase in popularity would be unlikely to last as the consequences started to become apparent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Washington has already been playing a relatively weak hand trying to contain </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> influence. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has skillfully deployed investments to win over countries from Africa to Latin America, broadening its network of influence. Its proposed Asian infrastructure bank proceeded, despite opposition from the Obama administration, after Britain and other American allies jumped on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is becoming a leading member of the international community,'' Mr. Prasad wrote in his new book ''Gaining Currency,'' but not, ''as the West prefers, by being co-opted into existing institutions under the current rules of the game.'' Instead, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is ''co-opting other countries into the system of rules it wants to dictate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> just gave </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> alternative system of rules a big push forward.</SPAN></P>
