<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is arranging classified intelligence briefings for Hillary Clinton and Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to prepare them for the White House. This longstanding practice of briefing nominees is controversial this year: Senator Harry Reid has urged the C.I.A. to give </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a ''fake'' briefing, while House Speaker Paul Ryan has said Clinton can't handle classified material. But what would a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> briefing look like, anyway?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, I'm Gene Smith from the C.I.A.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Smith, huh? Is that your code name? You know, I know a huge amount about the C.I.A., more than most C.I.A. directors. A terrific, beautiful, very good organization.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Actually, Smith is my real name. Anyway, let's get started with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and our assessment that Xi is much more aggressive than Hu.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She is more aggressive than who?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Exactly.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Well, I'd like to meet her. I like aggressive women. She sounds like a 10.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Who?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I don't know. That aggressive woman.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm not sure I understand. Anyway, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> we assess with high confidence that Xi will continue this aggressive nationalistic ----''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She sounds hot. No, I'm just joking. But, seriously, women love me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Xi is a man, president of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She is a man? </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president is trans? Boy, they're more modern than I realized -- I mean, I knew that. I know so much about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. You should see me use chopsticks! Did I ever tell you about this hot Chinese girl I once dated? She was so modern, and built like ----''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We expect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will maintain its nationalistic claims in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea ----''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Oh, don't worry. I have lots of Chinese friends. I love Chinese food. Best pad Thai in the world at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower. So what's your take, what do the Chinese think of me?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We assess with high confidence that the Chinese leadership wants you to win the election.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm not surprised. There are very, very bad reporters at completely and totally failing newspapers that nobody reads who say I might start a trade war. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants me to win the election! Amazing! So why does she want me to win, that transsexual president of theirs?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Xi is not trans! Xi would like you to win because alliance management is not your priority, and your presidency could lead to an unprecedented decline in U.S. influence.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Unprecedented! Amazing! So the Chinese think that I'd be unprecedented? Who else likes me?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Well, North Korea has already officially endorsed you, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. It called you 'prescient' and 'wise.'''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  '''Present and wise!' They love me! And Russia loves me, too. Putin and I go way back. We're like this'' -- </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> knits his fingers together -- ''and after I'm elected I hope to finally meet him.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Yes, we believe that President Putin is backing you.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Putin the Pro. Not like Little Ukraine. Sad!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Well, Putin believes that NATO might collapse in your presidency and that he would have a freer hand in Ukraine and the Baltics.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Baltics, I know them better than anybody! Melania is from Slovenia. Some people say I leaked those amazing pictures of her to The New York Post. Why would I do that? Did you see them? Here ----''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And you mean the Balkans, even though Slovenia isn't ----''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Balkans, Baltics -- I don't get bogged down in details. I'm a strategy guy. Now what about ISIS? I know more about ISIS than the generals do. But I'd like to hear your take. Are they supporters?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We assess that they are supporting you in the belief that you help recruitment. Indeed, we fear that they may conduct a terror strike in hopes of helping you get elected.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Everybody's supporting me! What about the Middle East? I'll probably do a peace deal -- I'm a terrific deal maker, you know that? I'll probably get a Nobel Peace Prize to go with my new Purple Heart.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Well, sir, the Middle East is complicated ----''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Middle East is a complete and total disaster. They don't respect us. What about nuclear weapons? If we have nukes, why not use 'em?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Sir, we only offer intel, not policy advice. But ----''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Shouldn't we just drop a few nukes on those Kurds?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Kurds? In Syria, they're our only effective ally.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They're doing bad things. Very bad things. I saw it on a Sunday show.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Oh, you mean ... the Quds Force?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Kurds, Quds, what's the difference? If I give the order to bomb 'em, you guys can sweat the details. Call Mike Pence.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''But you're running to be ----''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Anyway, tell me about internet security. I'm a little bored. How about we hack into the phone of Miss Sweden and check out her selfies? When I'm elected I'm going to have a whole team on that. ...''</SPAN></P>
