<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;People here are ecstatic about the phone call between the U.S. president-elect and Taiwan's president. But is the U.S. really ready for change?<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAIPEI, Taiwan - The atmosphere here is almost jubilant. The phone call last weekend from President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan to President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - the first contact between a Taiwanese president and an American president or president-elect since at least 1979 - has received rare bipartisan support here on this self-governing island off southern </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. It was, many agree, a great thing for the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, in an interview on Tuesday, her first since the call, Ms. Tsai said that the implications of the direct contact with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were limited. &quot;I have to stress that one phone call does not mean a policy shift,&quot; she told me and a small group of other American journalists who traveled here on a reporting trip organized by the East-West Center, a Hawaii-based nonprofit organization. &quot;I do not foresee major policy shifts in the near future because we all see the value of stability in the region.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ms. Tsai's statement is unlikely to dampen the excitement. For the first time in years, this island of 23 million is making headlines around the world. That's cause for celebration in a country that usually feels abandoned and ignored - even if it remains unclear how United States policy toward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will really change under Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Taiwan, we have this feeling that we are being forgotten by the world,&quot; said Szu-chien Hsu, a political scientist and president of the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy. &quot;We are this vibrant democracy, but people always forget about us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has grown in wealth and stature, Beijing has steadily chipped away at Taiwan's standing in the world. Taiwan's economy is the fifth largest in Asia and the 22nd largest in the world. Yet the island is shut out of membership in international organizations like the United Nations, and can't even accept Olympic medals under its own flag or preferred name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, Taiwan has developed its own democratic traditions right under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nose. Taiwanese are fiercely proud of their democracy. Many here crave recognition for this accomplishment. In our interview, Ms. Tsai alluded to the kinship that Taiwanese felt with liberal democracies like the United States as one reason for the contact with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;The phone call was a way for us to express our respect for the U.S. election,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in the United States, many foreign policy experts reacted with alarm. &quot;The Chinese leadership will see this as a highly provocative action, of historic proportions,&quot; Evan Medeiros, a former Asia director at the National Security Council under President Obama, told The Financial Times. &quot;With this kind of move, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is setting a foundation of enduring mistrust and strategic competition for U.S.-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States maintains a careful balancing act in its relations with Taiwan. Beijing views Taiwan as part of its sovereign territory, though the island has governed itself since 1949. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demands that other countries adhere to a &quot;one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; policy, having diplomatic relations with Beijing or Taipei, but not both. A vast majority of the world, of course, chooses Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foreign policy establishment's dismay over the call to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plays into the idea that the United States-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relationship is fragile and must be painstakingly nurtured to prevent international crisis. But this may be a fallacy. Relations between the two countries have remained largely stable since official diplomatic relations began in 1979, and even the Tiananmen Square uprising and the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis, when the United States sent two aircraft carrier battle groups to the area in response to provocative missile tests by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, did no lasting damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While United States-Taiwan relations remain informal but strong, some Taiwanese are frustrated with Washington's apparent fixation on pleasing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;The people who quickly condemn this in the U.S., they do so either to kowtow to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or to attack </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; Kwang-yin Liu, a reporter at CommonWealth Magazine in Taipei, told me. &quot;Few really care about what values Taiwan stands for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Tsai's call to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> carries a risk for Taiwan, whose economy is closely intertwined with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has already expressed its displeasure with Ms. Tsai's less Beijing-friendly administration by restricting mainland tourism to the island. Beijing's reaction to Ms. Tsai's conversation with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> so far has been relatively mild, but it could easily retaliate for the phone call, further limiting tourist permits, or even poaching Taiwan's few remaining allies, for example, by offering trade deals in exchange for recognizing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> instead of Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest country to switch its diplomatic relations from Taiwan to the People's Republic was the tiny African nation of Gambia in March. Further diplomatic losses would be a heavy blow to Taiwan. One senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told me, &quot;We do not want to play this up to confront </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, by contrast, far more difficult for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to retaliate against the United States without harming itself in the process. Such retaliation could include </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reluctance to sign on to American foreign policy priorities, like sanctions on Iran or efforts to halt North Korea's missile program - important, to be sure, but hardly existential threats to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though the repercussions it faces are far greater, Taiwan seems less afraid of standing up to the Goliath next door than its more powerful North American friend. Despite facing a sober future, Taiwanese will continue to celebrate what they see as an overdue recognition of their hard-won existence. The United States seems fainthearted by comparison.</SPAN></P>
