</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the many issues that kept the Liberal Party of Canada in the political wilderness until last year was the lingering odor of what came to be called the sponsorship scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a decade ago, it emerged that the Liberal government of Prime Minister Jean Chr&eacute;tien had given advertising agencies more than 100 million Canadian dollars for doing little or no work. An inquiry found that those agencies either donated some of the money to the Liberals or put party workers on their payrolls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Mr. Chr&eacute;tien stepped down in 2003, he introduced what became a series of reforms to election funding laws. Today, corporations and unions can no longer make federal political donations, and individuals cannot give more than 1,525 Canadian dollars a year - a measly amount by American standards.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Justin Trudeau became prime minister last year, he took it further, putting forward an ethics policy for his cabinet ministers that went far beyond federal law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this week Mr. Trudeau wasdrawn into a growing debate about the propriety of a current Liberal fund-raising program in which small numbers of donors pay as little as 500 Canadian dollars to attend small gatherings that include cabinet ministers. The federal ethics commissioner had already said that while the gatherings broke no laws, they were also &quot;not very savory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, The Tyee, a online publication based in Vancouver, British Columbia, reported that Mr. Trudeau had attended a fund-raiser for wealthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">businessmen in Toronto in May. The story gained more attention this week when The Globe and Mail reported that the prime minister's audience included Zhang Bin, the president of a Beijing-based promotional agency controlled by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> minister of culture. Shortly after the fund-raiser, Mr. Zhang and his group's honorary president made a joint donation of 1 million Canadian dollars to the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation, which includes Justin Trudeau's brother among its board members, and the University of Montreal law faculty. The gift also covered funding for a statue of Pierre Trudeau, the former prime minister and Justin's father, at the law school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Trudeau said that no rules or ethical limits were broken. But the debate is unlikely to quickly dissipate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greening up. Scientists said this week that global warming has spurredthe growth of algae, an important food source in the Arctic, by 47 percent between 1997 and 2015. The algae is also starting to bloom earlier. What that means for the Arctic ecosystem is not clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airborne. Justin Trudeau promised during the last election that his government would find a cheaper alternative to the F-35 fighter jet for Canada's military. This week, his government punted its decision on the country's aging fighters into the future. The government said it will purchase 18 F-18 jets as a temporary measure and start a fighter jet review that will include the F-35, the plane Mr. Trudeau vowed not to buy. If it runs for its full five years, the review will not finish until after the next election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tourist site. Neil Genzlinger, The Times's television critic, has watched &quot;Polar Bear Town,&quot; a six-part documentary series about Churchill, Manitoba's unique wildlife tourism center. &quot;Seeing tourists intrude on the natural cycle of the animals is annoying, but it's hard to blame them - the bears are gorgeous,&quot; he wrote. In the episode I watched (it airs on OLN Canada), a guide said his most demanding, and dangerous, clients were television film crews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are some articles from The Times, not necessarily related to Canada, that I found interesting this week:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Andrew C. Revkin concluded the Dot Earth blog with some thoughts on how to sift through fake news and the Toronto Transit Commission's contribution to the popular GIF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- If Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> makes significant protectionist moves on trade, Canada could be among the nations most affected. Neil Irwin looked at three possible scenarios of what Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might actually do with trade once he is in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The National Hockey League's decision to give an expansion franchise to Las Vegas has not been popular in Canada, particularly in Quebec City. Naila-Jean Meyers took a deep look at the plans of, and the to-do lists for, the Vegas Golden Knights.</SPAN></P>
