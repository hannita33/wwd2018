<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The president-elect drew global responses after an interview with The Wall Street Journal and with two European newspapers, Bild and The Times of London.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called NATO obsolete. He said Germany's acceptance of refugees is &quot;utterly catastrophic.&quot; The decades-old One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy embraced by the United States? That's up for discussion. Just days before Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inauguration, world leaders on three continents are on edge after comments the president-elect made in an interview on Friday with The Wall Street Journal and in a weekend interview with two European newspapers, Bild and The Times of London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATO is 'obsolete'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's obsolete, first because it was designed many, many years ago,&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, according to the German newspaper Bild. The 28-member alliance, born in 1949, three years after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, is viewed by many - including his nominee for defense secretary, Gen. James N. Mattis - as essential to American security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Secondly, countries aren't paying what they should&quot; and NATO &quot;didn't deal with terrorism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding on Monday to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments, Dalia Grybauskaite, the president of Lithuania, which gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and joined NATO in 2004, urged Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to continue meeting the United States' financial obligations toward the alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since World War II, the presence of U.S. troops has been a prerequisite for rebuilding the Continent, safeguarding peace and ensuring security. We expect continuity from the new U.S. administration. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must maintain this leadership role, to ensure security, stability and peace.&quot; - Ms. Grybauskaite</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The force of Europeans is in their unity'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also criticized the European Union, describing it as &quot;basically a vehicle for Germany.&quot; He praised Britain for its vote to leave the bloc, known as Brexit, adding: &quot;I believe others will leave. I do think keeping it together is not going to be as easy as a lot of people think.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that we Europeans have our destiny in our own hands, and I would very strongly argue that we all stand together.&quot; - Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, about the  27 European Union members that will remain after Britain's departure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French leaders also bristled at Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> swipe against the bloc. Their response comes as they deal with growing domestic support for the anti-European Union and anti-immigrant party National Front, led by Marine Le Pen, who was spotted on Thursday at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The best response,&quot; said the French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, &quot;is European unity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As with the case of Brexit, the best way to defend Europe is to remain united. This is a bit of an invitation that we are making to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. To remain a bloc. Not to forget that the force of Europeans is in their unity.&quot; - Mr. Ayrault</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will 'take off the gloves'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the interview with The Journal, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy was up for negotiation. Beijing responded quickly and decisively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its Foreign Ministry called the policy, which recognizes Beijing as the sole Chinese government, the foundation of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-United States ties, and it said it was nonnegotiable. People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the governing Communist Party, said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;has been stunningly confident in his ostensible knowledge of the job, though he speaks like a rookie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unusually strongly worded editorial in the state-run </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daily said on Monday that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was &quot;playing with fire with his Taiwan game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is determined to use this gambit on taking office, a period of fierce, damaging interactions will be unavoidable, as Beijing will have no choice but to take off the gloves,&quot; the newspaper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Monday that any effort to undermine the policy could backfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anyone attempts to damage the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> principle, or if they are under the illusion they can use this as a bargaining chip, they will be opposed by the Chinese government and people. In the end, it will be like lifting a rock to drop it on one's own feet.&quot; - Hua Chunying, the spokeswoman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexico warns against punitive tariffs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also took aim at German automakers, warning of a 35 percent tariff on any cars they build in Mexico and export to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares of BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler fell on Monday after his comments, but BMW said the company would stick to its plans to open a plant in Mexico in 2019.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very clear that we have to be prepared to immediately be able to neutralize the impact of a measure of that nature,&quot; Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, Mexico's economy minister, said on Friday on a Mexican news show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be a problem for the entire world,&quot; Mr. Guajardo Villarreal warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a tariff &quot;will have a wave of impacts that can take us into a global recession,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And from Russia, a nod</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not surprisingly, Russian diplomats were unperturbed by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments on NATO. They welcomed the &quot;obsolete&quot; label and were enthusiastic at his suggestion that he would consider reducing sanctions against Russia if the country agreed to reduce its nuclear arsenal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, said on Monday that &quot;NATO is indeed a vestige,&quot; according to Radio Free Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering that NATO &quot;is focused on confrontation and its entire structure is devoted to the ideals of confrontation, then, of course, this can hardly be called a modern structure meeting the ideas of stability, sustainable development and security.&quot; - Mr. Peskov</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's wait until he assumes office before we give assessment to any initiatives,&quot; he said.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Related Articles</SPAN><BR></P>
