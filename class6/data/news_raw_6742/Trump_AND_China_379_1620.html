</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEOUL, South Korea - Since October, when the corruption scandal involving President Park Geun-hye of South Korea first erupted, North Korea has been uncharacteristically restrained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the North, which had been accelerating the development of its nuclear program, has maintained a steady stream of sarcastic criticism of Ms. Park, it has not conducted ballistic missile or nuclear tests, even as the United Nations has tightened sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts and officials here say North Korea did not want to give political cover to Ms. Park, who had adopted a hard-line approach to her volatile neighbor. She could have seized on further tests or military provocations to divert attention from her own disaster, they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The North's relative silence underscores the deep uncertainty into which the region has been thrown - not only by South Korea's political crisis, whose denouement could still be months away after the South Korean National Assembly voted to impeach Ms. Park on Friday, but also by questions about how Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will deal with North Korea as president, given his contradictory remarks on the subject during his campaign.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not think we have ever seen a time when you have had simultaneous uncertainty about governance in both Seoul and Washington,&quot; said Duyeon Kim, a visiting senior fellow at the Korean Peninsula Future Forum, a think tank in Seoul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The profound unpopularity of Ms. Park, a conservative, increases the likelihood that South Korea's next president will be a liberal who favors more dialogue and economic engagement with the North. But in the United States, with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> yet to announce his choice for secretary of state, analysts and officials in the region are left guessing what American policy on North Korea might look like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> right now looks like he's running the whole spectrum from opening up talks in a serious way all the way to considering a military strike,&quot; said John Delury, an associate professor of Chinese studies and a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul. &quot;Either South Korean and U.S. policies could go into a new alignment based on a totally different approach or they could get completely out of whack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, there is unlikely to be any change in the South's approach to North Korea. After the impeachment vote, Ms. Park's powers were suspended and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, a staunch ally, was made acting president. In a public address, Mr. Hwang said the government would &quot;strive to maintain rock-solid security readiness&quot; against North Korea and reaffirmed the alliance with the United States, the centerpiece of South Korea's defense against the North.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North Korea has yet to comment officially on Ms. Park's impeachment vote. But its propaganda website, Uriminzokkiri, reported that the South Korean National Assembly had voted overwhelmingly to punish the &quot;traitor Park Geun-hye.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the coming months, South Korea's Constitutional Court will consider whether to endorse Ms. Park's impeachment and remove her permanently. If it votes to do so, South Korea will have 60 days to hold an election for a new president. (On Saturday in Seoul, the scene of huge demonstrations in recent weeks, tens of thousands of protesters demanded that Ms. Park resign immediately.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Korea's fast-paced, rough-and-tumble political arena, it is something of a fool's errand to try to predict who might win a presidential election several months away. Among the potential candidates, Ban Ki-moon, the departing United Nations secretary general, is the least likely to swerve from Ms. Park's policies, though he has appeared more willing to pursue dialogue with the North, analysts said. A career diplomat, Mr. Ban is popular among conservatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the other top contenders are liberals. If one of them wins, several of Ms. Park's key policies are likely to be scrutinized, including a recently signed agreement to share military intelligence with Japan and the planned deployment of an American missile defense system that has deeply upset relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whoever replaces Ms. Park is unlikely to try to overturn United Nations sanctions against North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, at least right away. But analysts here said the next president was likely to return to a more open diplomatic approach with the North. The new leader might also try to cooperate economically by reopening a jointly run industrial park in the North Korean town of Kaesong, which Ms. Park closed in retaliation against the North's nuclear test in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moon Jae-in, an opposition leader with the Democratic Party, who polls indicate is the most popular presidential contender, is critical of the current approach to North Korea, saying sanctions alone will not end its nuclear weapons program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Moon says he supports his country's alliance with Washington, but has argued that South Korea needs a more &quot;balanced diplomacy&quot; between the United States, its primary military ally, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, its biggest trade partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When liberals last occupied South Korea's presidential Blue House, from 1998 to 2008, they strove for engagement with North Korea, in what was known as the Sunshine Policy. But since then, North Korea has moved much further along in its efforts to develop nuclear weapons and missiles able to reach not just South Korea and Japan, but potentially the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That could make it difficult for liberals to simply reinstate past policies of openness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If North Korea is pronounced to be capable of hitting the West Coast of the United States, then it's going to be hard, even for a liberal government, to reopen Kaesong and pursue other cooperation projects,&quot; said Kim Sung-han, a professor of international relations at Korea University who was a vice foreign minister under Ms. Park's predecessor, Lee Myung-bak, also a conservative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will do is even harder to predict. During the campaign, he said he was willing to have direct talks with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader. But he also referred to Mr. Kim as &quot;a maniac,&quot; and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> selection for national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, has described North Korea as a country that harbors &quot;hatred of the West,&quot; suggesting that he would advise a hard-line approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With both the United Nations and the Treasury Department having announced new sanctions this year, analysts suggested that the incoming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration was likely to wait and see if those measures press North Korea into talks to slow or abandon its nuclear program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let it play out and see if it brings them back to the table,&quot; said Victor Cha, who served in President George W. Bush's administration and is now a North Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Left-leaning analysts in South Korea who support engagement with North Korea said a liberal president would also consider backtracking on Ms. Park's agreement to host the advanced American missile defense system known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad. Ms. Park's decision was unpopular with many South Koreans and angered </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which sees the system as an effort to restrict its ambitions in Asia, though Washington and Seoul have said it is meant only to defend South Korea against the North.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a liberal South Korean president could be boxed in if the new system is deployed around the time he or she takes office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The opposition leaders who run for president will be getting support from those Koreans who oppose the deployment of Thaad,&quot; said Moon Chung-in, an emeritus professor of politics at Yonsei University in Seoul. &quot;And if they get elected, then they should respond to the people, and they would have to say to the U.S., 'Can you reconsider the deployment of Thaad?' Then </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and others will be very angry and that can really hurt the alliance&quot; with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other analysts, perhaps demonstrating that the many unknowns of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> views can lead to wild speculation, suggested that his pursuit of business deals could work in North Korea's favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If North Korea offers to Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that there is a lot of real estate that he can develop in North Korea - for example the Kumgang Mountain tourist region - I think Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be very interested,&quot; said Geun Lee, a professor of political science at the Graduate School of International Studies at Seoul National University. &quot;And in return for these business opportunities, perhaps North Korea would give up its nuclear program temporarily.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More likely is that North Korea will conduct further nuclear and missile tests, whose results could be more influential than anything else in deciding policy toward the North.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they can demonstrate they can reach the United States, that's going to be a big deal,&quot; Mr. Cha said. &quot;Often presidencies are not about what agenda you have coming in, but it's the crisis you have to deal with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
