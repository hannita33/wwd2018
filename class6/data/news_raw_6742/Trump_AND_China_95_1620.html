<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The conflicts are in many ways as complex as his business empire, adding a heightened degree of difficulty for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to separate his official duties from his private business affairs.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - Just a few blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House sits the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Hotel, one of the newest luxury additions to President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> real estate empire, and perhaps the most visible symbol of the ethical quandary he now confronts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International operates out of the Old Post Office Building, which the federal government owns. That means Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be appointing the head of the General Services Administration, which manages the property, while his children will be running a hotel that has tens of millions of dollars in ties with the agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also will oversee the National Labor Relations Board while it decides union disputes involving any of his hotels. A week before the election, the board ruled against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hotel in a case in Las Vegas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The layers of potential conflicts he faces are in many ways as complex as his far-flung business empire, adding a heightened degree of difficulty for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - one of the wealthiest men to ever occupy the White House - in separating his official duties from his private business affairs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further complicating matters are Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision to name his children to his transition team, and what is likely to be their informal advisory role in his administration. His daughter Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> joined an official transition meeting on Thursday, the day before Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey was removed from his post leading the effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he will eliminate ethical concerns by turning the management of his company over to his children, an arrangement he has referred to as a blind trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ethics lawyers - both Republicans and Democrats - say it is far from blind because he would have knowledge of the assets in the trust and be in contact with the people running it, making it unlike a conventional blind trust controlled entirely by an independent party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To say that his children running his businesses is the equivalent of a blind trust - there is simply no credibility in that claim,&quot; said Matthew T. Sanderson, a Washington lawyer and Republican who has worked on the presidential campaigns of John McCain, Rand Paul and Rick Perry. &quot;Yes, the American public elected him knowing he has these assets, but unless he deals with this properly there will just be a steady trickle of these conflict-of-interest stories, and it could be a drag on his presidency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as part of his bid for the White House, released information about his financial holdings, which include more than a dozen hotels and golf courses; commercial real estate space, including </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower and 40 Wall Street in New York; and marketing deals in the United States and abroad. But it is unclear how much information was not disclosed, in part because he declined to release even a summary of his tax returns - becoming the first presidential candidate not to do so in 40 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rudolph W. Giuliani, a close adviser to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said on CNN's &quot;State of the Union&quot; on Sunday that excluding Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family from a role in his businesses &quot;would basically put his children out of work.&quot; The public, Mr. Giuliani said, needs to trust Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have to have some confidence in the integrity of the president,&quot; Mr. Giuliani said. &quot;The man is an enormously wealthy man. I don't think there's any real fear or suspicion that he's seeking to enrich himself by being president. If he wanted to enrich himself, he wouldn't have run for president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the transition, declined to respond to questions about possible conflicts of interest Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might face as president. &quot;The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization will respond accordingly,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> company said in a statement that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization was already working to address possible conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are in the process of vetting various structures with the goal of the immediate transfer of management of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization and its portfolio of businesses to Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> along with a team of highly skilled executives,&quot; the statement said. &quot;This is a top priority at the organization, and the structure that is ultimately selected will comply with all applicable rules and regulations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous presidents have encountered questions about their financial holdings. Lyndon B. Johnson, through his wife, continued to have ownership of television stations while he was president. George Washington enlisted the Treasury Department to help find a runaway slave. But presidents have often taken steps to prevent ethical questions. George Bush put his stock holdings into ablind trust after he was elected vice president, and Jimmy Carter turned his peanut farm over to a blind trust after he was elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As president, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be exempt from a federal ethics rule that prohibits government employees and members of Congress from taking actions that could benefit their financial interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the president still must comply with a law that requires annual financial disclosures of his assets. The first will not be due until May 2018, although President Obama filed one voluntarily during his first year in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts said that even if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was exempt from some federal ethics rules, the public will expect him to not use his office to benefit his personal finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has campaigned on a platform of getting rid of corruption and that Washington is broken and we need new, refreshing change,&quot; said Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause, a nonprofit that pushes for accountability in government. &quot;As president, the American public expects that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be held to a higher standard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement on Monday, the General Services Administration said that the agency realized it must examine its Old Post Office lease with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family-owned business &quot;to allow a path to be put in place to identify and address any potential conflict of interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on Monday, Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland and the ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, called for an inquiry into how Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will handle these potential conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The American people have the right to know - they ought to know - exactly whether decisions are possibly being made that would benefit him, his family and his associates directly,&quot; Mr. Cummings said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The labor dispute in Nevada represents another potential complication. The president appoints all five membersof the National Labor Relations Board. But over the past year, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Hotel Las Vegas has been in a battle with the culinary workers union, at first challenging an effort by hotel employees to unionize. The labor board ruled against him in July. Then the hotel, which Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> co-owns, refused to begin negotiations with the new union, and the labor board again ruled against it, in November. Other labor disputes with employees are pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Will he as president of the United States of America use the power he has to interfere - given that he has a financial interest in the outcome of these matters?&quot; said Bethany Khan, a spokeswoman for the 57,000-member Culinary Workers Union Local 226 of Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps most troubling for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, several ethics lawyers said, is a relatively obscure provision of the Constitution, called the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits any government official from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government, or even from sharing in profits in a company that has financial ties to a foreign government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has had business deals with foreign governments or individuals with apparent ties to foreign governments, including multimillion-dollar real estate arrangements in Azerbaijan and Uruguay. His children have frequently traveled abroad to promote the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brand, making trips to Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Scotland. Closer to home, the Bank of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a tenant in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower and is a lender for another building in Midtown Manhattan where Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has a significant partnership interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Doing business with a foreign corporation, be it in Azerbaijan, Turkey or Russia, if is it owned in part or controlled by a foreign government - any benefit that would accrue to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could well be a violation of the Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution,&quot; said Kenneth A. Gross, a political ethics and compliance lawyer in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also more general issues that could prove troubling. For instance, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will nominate the Treasury secretary, yet he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to banks, and he benefits from low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve, an institution he has criticized as political. The head of the Internal Revenue Service is also appointed by the president, and the agency is currently auditing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taxes and sets tax policy that directly affects his businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> real estate and financial holdings that represent the most sensitive ethical areas, the ethics lawyer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> children are already deeply involved in the daily operations of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization. Ivanka is executive vice president for development and acquisitions, and is in charge of domestic and global expansion of the company's real estate interests. Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also has her own clothing, jewelry and footwear lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even this week, Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> turned her appearance on Sunday on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; - with her father - into a marketing opportunity for her line of jewelry, with one of her employees urging reporters to write about the $10,800 gold bangle bracelet she wore during the interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Jr. is also an executive vice president in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization, and the company's website says he directs new project acquisition and development in regions &quot;from Eastern Europe to Southeast Asia, the Middle East to South America, mainland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eric is in charge of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization's golf course collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll be in New York and we'll take care of the business,&quot; Eric </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in an interview with &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that was broadcast on Sunday. &quot;I think we're going to have a lot of fun doing it. And we're going to make him very proud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
