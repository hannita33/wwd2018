</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United States markets ended the session mixed on Monday as interest rates continued to rise. Bond yields climbed to their highest levels this year, which pointed to higher interest rates and bigger profits for banks from lending money. Investors have been selling bonds, pushing yields higher, as they expect the spending plans of President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to lead to higher inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KEEPING SCORE The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up 0.1 percent, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index was unchanged. The Nasdaq composite index lost 0.4 percent. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  TECH TROUBLES Shares of technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple stock gave up 2.5 percent while Facebook stock declined 3.3 percent and shares of Microsoft slid 1.5 percent. Shares of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped 2.4 percent. Tech stocks have struggled over the last few days as investors wondered if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policies as president would hurt their sales in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other markets overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BANK BONANZA Bank stocks continued to surge, rising in part because of the big jump in bond yields since the election. Investors were also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Bank of America stock rose 5.6 percent and shares of JPMorgan Chase picked up 3.7 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  DOING DEALS The South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it would buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes products for connected cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped 25.2 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  MENTORING The German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy the software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor's stock rose 18.3 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  DIG IT Shares of the communication adapter maker Digi International rose 15 percent after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it was too low. Belden stock added 2.2 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BONDS AND CURRENCIES However, the view in bond markets was somewhat different, with investors fretting over the inflation outlook and the more lax spending environment. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds was up 0.09 percentage points Monday at 2.2 percent. The rise in bond yields has helped support the dollar as traders price in the prospect of bigger returns on their holdings. The euro was down 0.9 percent at $1.0753 while the dollar rose 1.3 percent to 108.06 yen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  LAGGARDS Stocks that pay large dividends, like phone and utility companies and real estate investment trusts, all traded lower. Those stocks are most appealing to investors when bond yields are low. American Tower shares fell 3 percent and shares of NextEra Energy edged down 0.8 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">TRUMP</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FACTOR Stocks went into a long skid as the presidential campaign came to its conclusion, but in the last few days stocks have risen as investors hoped his presidency would mean cutbacks in regulations that affect energy and banks, among other businesses. The Dow has reached record highs, with the biggest recent gains going to the financial firms Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, the machinery maker Caterpillar and the drug company Merck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  EUROPEAN MARKETS In Germany, the DAX rose 0.2 percent, and in France, the CAC 40 gained 0.4 percent. The FTSE 100 was up 0.3 percent in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ASIA SCORECARD The Nikkei 225 stock average added 1.7 percent on Monday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent. The Shanghai composite index added 0.5 percent in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The Kospi lost 0.5 percent in South Korea. In Australia, the S.&amp;P./ASX 200 slid 0.5 percent. Markets in Southeast Asia fell, with the benchmark in Indonesia down 2.2 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ENERGY With the dollar gaining strength, benchmark United States crude oil fell 58 cents, to $42.83 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 70 cents, to $44.05 a barrel in London.</SPAN></P>
