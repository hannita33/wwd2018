<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''Senators Push to Widen Inquiry on Russian Meddling in Election'' (front page, Dec. 19): </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is not just about Russian hacking of our election, but about cybersecurity in general. If Russia gets away with this because our president-elect doesn't accept our intelligence agencies' assessment, it's open season for any foreign power to hack and disseminate information considered advantageous to its own welfare. This includes not only hostile regimes (Iran), but trading partners (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> India) and ''friendly'' governments (Israel) as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Our cybersecurity has been lagging behind technological advances for years. Rather than deride the intelligence that we are at risk, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the G.O.P. should be vowing to make ours the most cybersecure nation in the world. That is what would have happened had the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign emails been released, and Hillary Clinton been elected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can be so dismissive of the American intelligence community's consensus, now made public, of Russia's cyber meddling in our presidential election on his behalf, what happens after his inauguration when that intelligence community reports exclusively to him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Put another way, what future intelligence will President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dismiss or withhold from the American public, however accurate and alarming, if he finds it politically inconvenient or personally embarrassing?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Extreme partisanship continues to erode the foundations of our democracy. It is up to our elected officials to work for the good of the people they represent, not for individual or party power. Republicans and Democrats must unite to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election. A committee similar to the Watergate committee must be appointed and its hearings televised. The Russian hacking is an attack on our country, and regardless of political affiliation every American should demand a strong response. Where is the outrage? Let a nonpartisan investigation reveal the people involved and the extent of their criminality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ariel Dorfman eloquently argues that what Russia allegedly did in hacking the 2016 United States presidential election, the United States has often done to other countries, including his native Chile (''Now America Knows How Chile Felt,'' Op-Ed, Dec. 17).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Dorfman is correct: If Russia helped Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> win the White House, that undermines Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> legitimacy, but it must not be the occasion for retaliation. In the context of nuclear superpowers, retaliation would be extremely dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is past time to recognize that cyber war is nothing less than war, with extremely serious consequences. This is the moment to press for a global agreement banning state-sponsored cyber war, whether attacks on a nation's power grid or its electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While a treaty would not stop nonstate actors, it would help isolate perpetrators as rogues and reduce the risk that cyberattacks would slide into conventional or nuclear conflict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Re ''Afraid to Politicize Intelligence, Obama Delayed Blaming Russia for Hack'' (news article, Dec. 15):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama said in effect that he did not want to give the appearance of meddling in the election. If the trade-off was between the president's appearance of not meddling and the American people having to put up with four disastrous years, I think that the choice should have been clear.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Re ''Obama Vows U.S. Reprisal for Moscow's Meddling'' (news article, Dec. 17): President Obama stated, ''I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action.'' Yet in April 2016, President Obama tried to influence the Brexit vote by using scare tactics through his comment that Britain would be in the ''back of the queue'' with regard to any trade deal with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clearly President Obama is being hypocritical with his recent comments. Governments consistently try to exert influence, whether overtly or covertly, and the United States is no exception.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Re ''Putin's 'Personal Beef' Led to Hacking Attacks, Clinton Tells Supporters'' (news article, Dec. 17):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hillary Clinton is correct. The Russian hacking was an unforgivable attack against America, for which Russia must bear significant consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But it is not true that a combination of the hacking and the F.B.I.'s letter about its review of additional emails were responsible for her loss. Mrs. Clinton lost the election by ignoring an important constituency of white Rust Belt voters who were really hurting and needed someone to pay attention to them. The election was hers to lose, and she did. She shouldn't blame others for what was her own fault.</SPAN></P>
