<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAIPEI, Taiwan -- President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan met with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in Houston and then flew off to visit leaders in Latin America, seeking to promote her island's cause as it gets positive signals from President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting on Sunday with Mr. Cruz, who lost to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Republican presidential primary contest, suggested that Ms. Tsai was looking to expand her ties to the Republican Party as it takes control of the White House and keeps its grip on Congress. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I was honored to meet with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan today,'' Mr. Cruz said in a statement released after the meeting. ''We discussed our mutual opportunity to upgrade the stature of our bilateral relations in a wide-ranging discussion that addressed arms sales, diplomatic exchanges and economic relations.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Cruz added that members of Congress from the Houston area had received a ''curious'' letter from the Chinese Consulate requesting that they not meet with Ms. Tsai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Tsai's stop in Houston preceded visits to El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, four of the 20 countries, along with the Vatican, that maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan rather than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Last month, S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe, an island nation off the west coast of Africa, severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beijing's influence in Latin America and the Caribbean is growing, and it is expected to achieve recognition from more countries, as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the wealthier benefactor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States does not maintain official diplomatic relations with Taiwan as a result of negotiations with Beijing that led to Washington's recognition of the People's Republic of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under the ''One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' policy, which underpins relations between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States, Washington acknowledges that Beijing claims Taiwan while pledging to defend Taiwan from attack. The Communist Party of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has vowed to retake Taiwan, a democracy, by force if necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has warned Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> against making changes to the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy after he takes office on Jan. 20. The warning came in response to a phone call between Ms. Tsai and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after his November election victory, the highest-level exchange between American and Taiwanese leaders since the end of diplomatic relations and one that has threatened to upend relations between Washington and Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Ms. Tsai, it provided a potential opening with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Taiwan has maintained relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hawks in the Republican Party over the past several administrations,'' said Ian Rowen, a postdoctoral fellow at Academia Sinica in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. ''Cruz is influential above and beyond many senators, given his performance in the last election campaign. It makes sense to add Cruz, whatever his relationship is going to be with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Echoing the defiant Twitter posts Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> issued after speaking with Ms. Tsai, Mr. Cruz bluntly refused to allow Beijing to set the terms of meetings between officials from the United States and Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The People's Republic of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> needs to understand that in America we make decisions about meeting with visitors for ourselves,'' Mr. Cruz said. ''This is about the U.S. relationship with Taiwan, an ally we are legally bound to defend. The Chinese do not give us veto power over those with whom they meet. We will continue to meet with anyone, including the Taiwanese, as we see fit.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While American leaders have vowed to defend Taiwan from attack, the United States is not legally bound to do so, despite what Mr. Cruz said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While in Texas, Ms. Tsai also met with Gov. Greg Abbott, with whom she discussed energy, trade and commerce. Reducing Taiwan's economic reliance on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been a major focus for the Tsai administration, which took office in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the wake of the meetings, Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said Beijing opposed any contact between Taiwan's leader and ''anyone from the U.S. government,'' saying it threatens to hurt ties between Beijing and Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A Chinese-language statement about Ms. Tsai's time in Houston, released by Taiwan's presidential office, did not mention the meetings with Mr. Cruz or Mr. Abbott, focusing instead on her attendance at a banquet for overseas Taiwanese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the event, Ms. Tsai said that her administration had been committed to deepening relations between Taiwan and the United States, according to the statement. ''The U.S. is Taiwan's most important ally and friend, and it occupies a special place in the hearts of the Taiwanese people,'' it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Before leaving Houston, Ms. Tsai, speaking with reporters, said that her visits to the four Central American countries would ''show the international society that Taiwan is a capable and responsible partner for cooperation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After her Central American tour, Ms. Tsai will pass through San Francisco on her return to Taiwan. On Saturday, Jessica Ditto, a spokeswoman for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said in an email to The Associated Press that neither Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nor anyone on his transition team would be meeting with Ms. Tsai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In June, Ms. Tsai met with Senator Marco Rubio in Miami en route to Panama, another country with diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She has also previously met with Reince Priebus, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> chief of staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rowen, the postdoctoral fellow, said that the visits were timely given Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ascendance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In general, it raises Tsai's national and international stature to be going on trips like this,'' Mr. Rowen said. ''There is, however, the potential for a shift in U.S.-Taiwan relations, so of course she's going to seize the opportunity to meet with as many officials as possible.''</SPAN></P>
