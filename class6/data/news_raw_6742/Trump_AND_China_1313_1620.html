</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Thanksgiving this year, many Americans are anticipating turkey, mashed potatoes, pumpkin pie - and postelection combat with relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every election provokes some level of stress among voters, but mental health professionals say that the polarization of this year's presidential race appeared to have amplified the tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a very significant stressor for people this year,&quot; said Dr. Vaile Wright, director of research and special projects at the American Psychological Association.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, we asked readers to tell us whether they expected their Thanksgiving gatherings to provide a stage for potential blowups as seldom-seen relatives congregate for the first time since Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several people wrote to say they planned to adhere to a no-political-talk rule. Others said they were taking a more extreme approach - avoiding Thanksgiving get-togethers altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those disappointed by the presidential outcome, much of the anxiety stemmed from concerns that relatives who supported Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might gloat about his victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vince Garcia, 48, said he heard rumblings that two relatives were planning to wear </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gear at their Thanksgiving gathering. &quot;Quite honestly I'm not looking forward to it at all,&quot; he wrote in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Johnson, a retired engineer in San Clemente, said he and his wife worried that sparks could fly during their gathering of 18 family members. About half are loyal Democrats, he said, and half dedicated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If things get out of hand, Mr. Johnson, 66, said he planned to tell his guests: &quot;Just put all that stuff in a shoe box and put it on a shelf. Let's just not get into that topic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Wright said avoiding politics was sometimes the right approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the election outcome is weighing heavily on your mind, Thanksgiving can be a time to talk about it, she said. But if reconnecting with family is what's most important, it could be wise to just postpone the political talk for another time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kathy Winter, 61, a reader in San Diego, wrote in with a reminder that Thanksgiving is intended to be a moment to count blessings and connect with family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, she added, &quot;If we are all mature adults, we should be able to talk politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Finally ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still in need of a quick Thanksgiving recipe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We asked Cortney Burns, a chef at Bar Tartine in San Francisco, to suggest a dish that takes advantage of the fall season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She offered this one from a book she wrote with Nicolaus Balla, &quot;Bar Tartine: Techniques &amp; Recipes,&quot; winner of a 2015 James Beard award:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potato and Green Bean Soup</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a soup to make in late summer, or autumn when the days get shorter and the green beans grow big and tough. It is ideal for those end-of-season beans, which are much better cooked well past the bright green and crisp stage that culinary professionals prize. In this soup, the beans are cooked grandmother-style, until they are quite tender and develop a deep, earthy flavor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The butter that floats on the surface of this soup is essential to the soup's texture and flavor. We recommend you use cultured butter, which has a subtle tang. You can make it yourself or buy it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serves 4 to 6</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 tbsp. filtered grapeseed oil or good cooking oil</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 sweet white onion, cut into 1/4-in/6-mm dice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4 garlic cloves, minced</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3 cups/720 ML vegetable or poultry broth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12 oz/335 g russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-in/6-mm dice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 lb/455 g green beans, trimmed and cut into 3/4-in/2-cm pieces</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3 cups/720 ML buttermilk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 tbsp. plus 2 tsp. kosher salt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freshly ground black pepper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 cup/240 ML sour cream</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3 tbsp. apple cider vinegar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2 tbsp. butter, melted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley for garnish</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chopped fresh dill for garnish</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chopped fresh chives for garnish</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat until a drop of water flicked on the surface sizzles gently on contact. Add the grapeseed oil, then immediately add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are slightly softened but not browned, about 10 minutes. Add the broth, potatoes and green beans and simmer until the potatoes are tender enough to be easily pierced with a skewer, about 25 minutes. Remove from the heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a blender, combine 2 cups/475 ML of the broth and vegetables and the buttermilk and pur&eacute;e until smooth. Add the pur&eacute;e back to the saucepan, add the salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper, and place over medium heat. Bring to a simmer and cook gently until heated through, about five minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in 3/4 cup/180 ML of the sour cream and the vinegar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ladle the soup into individual bowls and garnish with melted butter, the remaining 1/4 cup/60 ML sour cream, the parsley, dill, chives, and plenty of pepper. Leftover soup will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days.</SPAN></P>
