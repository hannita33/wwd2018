</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PURCELLVILLE, Va. -- It is the kind of campaign he said he would never run. But Senator Marco Rubio, seeing his path to the Republican nomination grow narrower with each contest, has determined that the only way to beat Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is to fight like him: rough, dirty and mean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acidity coming from Mr. Rubio these days, and the gleefully savage way Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has responded, have sent an already surreal presidential campaign lurching into the gutter with taunts over perspiration, urination and self-tanner. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Sunday, the hits were more substantive, but no less aggressive: Mr. Rubio scoffed at Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> clothing line -- ''those tacky ties'' -- and criticized him for making them in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> education business, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University, was a scam that essentially stole tens of thousands of dollars from its students. And he expressed astonishment that during a television interview Sunday morning, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> refused to repudiate the white supremacist David Duke or the Ku Klux Klan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We cannot be a party who nominates someone who refuses to condemn white supremacists,'' Mr. Rubio said, to roaring approval from the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has been accused of stirring up racial strife, handed his critics more ammunition on Sunday when he refused the opportunity to distance himself from Mr. Duke and the Klan. Asked repeatedly to do so in an interview with CNN, he demurred. ''You wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about,'' he said. ''I would have to look.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later he backtracked, posting on Twitter, ''I disavow.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rubio's headfirst lunge into a bout with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a striking turnaround that the Florida senator himself calls disappointing. But it also reflects a conclusion that his above-the-fray approach was ineffective against a front-runner who seems to gain popularity with each fight he picks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I had hoped that this would be a campaign only about ideas,'' Mr. Rubio told the crowd of more than 3,000 here, in the far suburbs of Washington, as he accused Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of being a fraud, a threat to national security and possibly even a racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I need your vote Tuesday,'' Mr. Rubio told his audience, which was about as rowdy and animated as any he had drawn. ''Friends do not let friends vote for con artists.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Virginia is one of more than 10 delegate-rich states that will vote in the Super Tuesday contests this week -- others include Texas, Georgia, Alabama and Massachusetts -- most of which Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is favored to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was not content on Sunday to rest on his polls: He picked up the endorsement of Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a vehement opponent of the immigration overhaul that Mr. Rubio championed in 2013, in a boisterous late-afternoon rally outside Huntsville, Ala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I told Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 'This isn't a campaign, this is a movement,' '' Mr. Sessions said, looking out over a crowd of thousands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, campaigning in Oklahoma, tried to keep himself in the thick of the Republican fight by attacking Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over his use of foreign workers. But Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, all but conceding the Super Tuesday contests, lamented the demolition derby-like state of the primary contest, hoping his sense of decorum would help him win over voters in Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont both attacked Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as Mrs. Clinton all but ignored Mr. Sanders in courting black voters in Tennessee, while Mr. Sanders, campaigning in Oklahoma and Colorado, declared that ''love </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">trumps</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hatred.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rubio has seemed to sense that he could pay a price if he is seen as engaging in the kind of bullying that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has trademarked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''These are facts,'' he said, explaining his attacks on Sunday, ''about an individual who wants access to the nuclear codes for America.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As they watched Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> clinch his third straight victory with a win in the Nevada caucuses last week, Mr. Rubio and his aides concluded that the only way to beat him was to get inside his head, by stooping to his level: Taunt, insult, mock and have a blast doing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They seem satisfied that it is working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We came to the conclusion that if being a part of the circus is the price you have to pay in order for us to ultimately be able to talk about substantive policy, then that's what we're going to do,'' said Todd Harris, a senior Rubio adviser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Harris noted that Mr. Rubio's speeches were now being carried live on television. And if the price of admission, he added, was talking about ''how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a con man, with a bad spray tan,'' so be it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What has followed is a race that looks more like a variety show than a campaign to elect the most powerful leader on earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So far, Rubio supporters seem surprised by, if open to, his change in tone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alison Whiteley, a retiree in her 50s who saw Mr. Rubio speak in Oklahoma City on Friday, said the race had turned ''uglier'' this cycle, but she did not blame Mr. Rubio, whom she supports. ''Rubio would not be acting like this if it wasn't for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' she said. ''He has to stand up for himself because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is just running all over everybody.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cruz Lets Fly a Populist Pitch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  TULSA, Okla. -- A list of topics Mr. Cruz did not expect to be discussing 48 hours before the most important day of his candidacy: his opposition to the Ku Klux Klan; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tax returns and his possible ties to the mobster Fat Tony Salerno; ''Celebrity Apprentice.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet with Mr. Cruz's long-ballyhooed Southern firewall under assault, circumstances have conspired to force the Texas senator off message, if he hopes to remain central to the conversation at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Cruz, desperate for a Super Tuesday victory outside his home state, slipped north for three events in Oklahoma, a crucial target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The only campaign, the only candidate, in position to beat </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Super Tuesday is us,'' he told a few hundred energized locals inside a cavernous expo hall in Tulsa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For days, Mr. Cruz has pleaded with voters not to be dazzled by ''P. T. Barnum'' and the ''dancing bears'' of the 2016 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Sunday, at the sprawling event complex where he spoke, he competed for attention with an actual circus, elephants and all; a gun show; a youth volleyball tournament; and the ''Golden Driller,'' a well-known 76-foot statue of an oil worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The senator let fly a populist pitch, praising those ''with calluses on your hands'' and faulting Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for using foreign labor to fill service jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He asked those who had worked in restaurants to raise their hands. ''Take a look at the hands,'' he said, adding, ''My dad started washing dishes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As he finished, a small animal rights protest flared outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The circus hurts animals,'' read one sign, hauled by a young child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It showed an injured elephant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  -- MATT FLEGENHEIMER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kasich Pleads for Civility</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  SPRINGFIELD, Mass. -- Governor Kasich is sick and tired of all the shouting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kasich, the Mr. Positive in the Republican field, does not expect to win any states on Tuesday. But he hopes to do well in at least a few of them, including Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And these days, he would just like everyone to be nicer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He recalled Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Winston Churchill and the Rev. Billy Graham. They did not raise their voices, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The people in the media, they love the yelling and the screaming and the shouting and the insults, because it's like being in Talladega,'' he said at a town-hall-style forum here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We go to those races and we want to see something happen that ain't great on Turn 3 at Talladega,'' he said. ''But when we go to the races, we don't want to see a crackup every time they go around the track, and that's what we're getting today in American politics.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Frankly,'' he added, ''it's disgraceful.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The crowd applauded. Mr. Kasich said that the applause would never make it to television screens. ''Because it's nobody attacking anybody,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kasich soon turned to take questions. Lenny Cooperman, 63, an administrative law judge, asked him about immigration, but added a preface. ''I applaud you for keeping an air of dignity and civility in this campaign,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But that was not enough to win him over. After the forum, Mr. Cooperman said he was focused on deciding between two candidates: Mr. Kasich and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He said he liked the idea of an outsider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  -- THOMAS KAPLAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton Vows to Tackle Racism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  MEMPHIS -- A day after black voters delivered Mrs. Clinton an overwhelming victory in the South Carolina primary, she spoke at two black churches here, vowing to ''tackle the continuing challenge of systemic racism'' and decrying Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> slogan, ''Make America Great Again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''America has never stopped being great,'' she said at the Greater Imani Cathedral of Faith, her allusion to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> prompting a loud amen. ''Our task,'' Mrs. Clinton continued, ''is to make America whole.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After capturing nearly 74 percent of the black vote in South Carolina, Mrs. Clinton hopes support from African-Americans will propel her to victories against Mr. Sanders in Tennessee, Georgia and other Southern states on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton repeatedly spoke of bringing more ''love and kindness'' to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I know it's kind of odd sometimes when people hear me talking about, as I did last night in South Carolina, how we need more love and kindness,'' she said at the Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''But I believe that with all my heart,'' she said. ''We have to start treating each other with respect, listening to each other, holding out hands, a fellowship.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In her stump speech, Mrs. Clinton seemed to put Mr. Sanders in her rearview mirror, focusing on the stakes if a Republican won in the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She also spoke about the countries she visited as secretary of state -- ''large ones, small ones, itsy-bitsy ones,'' as she said at a stop in Nashville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They all want to be like us,'' she said, adding: ''We need to be whole, where everybody feels like we're all in this together.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A man in the crowd yelled out, ''We love you, Hillary!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton smiled and said, ''You know, I'm all about love and kindness, so I sure appreciate that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  -- AMY CHOZICK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sanders Is Blunt Yet Upbeat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  FORT COLLINS, Colo. -- Mr. Sanders did not mince words about his South Carolina loss. ''We got decimated,'' he said Sunday on ABC's ''This Week.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The only positive thing for us is we won the actually -- the 29 years of age and younger vote. And that was good. But we got killed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, he was upbeat. ''We think we're going to do very well in Minnesota on Super Tuesday; Colorado we're going to do well; Oklahoma we're going to do well,'' he said. ''I think we're going to win in Massachusetts. And I believe we're going to win in Vermont. And we're going to do better than people think in other states.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was buoyed by a crowd of about 6,000 in Oklahoma City, before heading to Fort Collins, Colo. He said he looked forward to defeating Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in November, whom he blasted for insulting ''Mexican, Muslims, women, African-Americans, veterans and basically anybody who does not look like him.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We will win,'' Mr. Sanders said, ''because love </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">trumps</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hatred.''</SPAN></P>
