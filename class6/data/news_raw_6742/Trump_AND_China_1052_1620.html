</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HERBALIFE VS. ACTIVIST: JUST MAYBE HE'S RIGHT Bill Ackman, the activist investor, has been painted as a loser in his quest to shut down Herbalife, the nutritional supplement company, but a Federal Trade Commission's complaint has vindicated his claims, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herbalife was responsible for &quot;deceiving hundreds of thousands of hopeful people,&quot; said Edith Ramirez, who oversees the F.T.C. &quot;The small minority of Herbalife distributors who did make a lot of money were paid by Herbalife not for selling the company's products, but for buying the products themselves and then successfully recruiting large networks of others to do the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been questions about Mr. Ackman's tactics, lobbying regulators and members of Congress, as well as moral questions about &quot;shorting,&quot; or betting against a company's stock, but this does seem to be an example where an investor acted as a check on the market.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UBER WAVES THE WHITE FLAG IN </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CHINA</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uber has become yet another company that has failed to capitalize on its foothold in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but it avoided making many of the same mistakes as its American tech forebears along the way. It created local teams that were able to respond quickly, and the co-founder and chief executive, Travis Kalanick, put in time meeting with Chinese officials. But Didi made it clear it was in the fight for the long run and Uber's investors wanted an end to the battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They may be reassured, but customers and drivers in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could be hurt as commissions drop. Uber may well want to focus on building national monopolies elsewhere now, but its stake in Didi now makes it an indirect part owner of its competitor Lyft, which has also been a useful ally in battles with regulators and taxi drivers. This all seems to point to a less directly competitive future, Justin Fox writes on Bloomberg View.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some view having two poles of leadership as beneficial with the giants of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States competing for customers in emerging markets like India, the Middle East and Africa. But others foresee a series of deals in which those titans carve out theirspheres of influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ON THE AGENDA The Securities and Exchange Commission Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee meets at 9:30 a.m. Data on income and spending for June will be published at 8:30 a.m. Pfizer and Procter &amp; Gamble report their second-quarter earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BIG BANKS PUSH INSTANT PAYMENTS The snail's pace at which money is processed has led many Americans to use mobile payments services like Paypal's Venmo or Square Cash. Offerings like Apple Pay and pressure from the Federal Reserve's &quot;faster payments committee&quot; have also heightened competition to control the payment network of the future. And banks are catching up - allowing their customers to send money to accounts in seconds - in the hope of vying with these companies, as well as Visa and MasterCard, in the market for instant payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they do not respond, banks could be relegated to performing less profitable back-office functions for newer payment companies and they would lose their first point of contact with a consumer, which allows them to sell other products, like loans.</SPAN></P>
