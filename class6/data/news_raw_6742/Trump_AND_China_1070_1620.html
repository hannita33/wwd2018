</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The friction between American intelligence agencies and Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> incoming administration is worsening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a Senate committee hearing, the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., above, criticized the &quot;disparagement&quot; of the intelligence community over its findings that Russia interfered in the presidential election. Bolstered by the support of senators from both parties, he will brief Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is expected to name retired Senator Dan Coats, a former ambassador to Germany, to replace Mr. Clapper as early as today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diplomats say that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition staff has broken with decades of precedent by requiring politically appointed ambassadors to leave their overseas posts by Inauguration Day, threatening to leave the U.S. without Senate-confirmed envoys for months in critical nations like Germany and Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A joint session of Congress today is to officially name Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the 45th president of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights experts worry that if the incoming president keeps his campaign promises to reinstate the sort of torture used in the Bush-era war on terrorism, authoritarian regimes around the world would see a green light to carry out abuses. Above, a detainee at Guant&aacute;namo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turkey suffered yet another terrorist attack, this one attributed to Kurdish militants. A police officer and a court worker, as well as the two attackers, were killed in a car bomb and gun assault on a courthouse in the city of Izmir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior Turkish official said the country had asked President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> team to reconsider U.S. support toSyrian Kurdishforces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> C&eacute;dric Herrou has become something of a folk hero in France for resisting the state and taking a stand: that it is simply right to help migrants seeking a better life. Mr. Herrou is facing prison for operating a loosely knit underground railroad to smuggle migrants north, many destined for Britain or Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A court in the southern French city of Nice is expected to issue a verdict today on charges of aiding illegal migrants against a university lecturer accused of giving a ride to three female Eritreans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intends to spend more than $360 billion through 2020 on renewable power sources like solar and wind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> France started slaughtering ducks in the main foie gras-producing region to try to contain a dangerous form of bird flu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ford Motor's announcement that it would incorporate Amazon's Alexa into its vehicles is but one of many recent efforts by automakers to improve voice-recognition systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The final U.S. jobs report for 2016, due today, is expected to extend the country's longest streak of job growth on record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 47-year-old Greek anarchist considered the country's most-wanted terrorist, above, has been arrested in an Athens suburb. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Turkish court sentenced two officers accused of participating in a failed coup in July to life in prison. [Hurriyet]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was questioned a second time by the police about potentially improper gifts and favors. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. named Hamza bin Laden, a son of Osama bin Laden, a &quot;global terrorist&quot; in an effort to hamper his movements and transactions. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police in Bangladesh said that they had killed one of the trainers who guided a team of militants through the brutal siege of a restaurant in Dhaka last year. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain sent envoys to Washington to improve ties with the incoming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration and prepare for Prime Minister Theresa May's visit in the spring. [The Guardian]</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frank Ntilikina, an 18-year-old from France, is widely considered the best prospect in European basketball and one of the most intriguing players expected to be available in the N.B.A. draft this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. health experts, in a major reversal, called for parents to give their children foods containing peanuts, starting in infancy, to help ward off life-threatening peanut allergies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Movie awards season kicks into high gear on Sunday with the Golden Globes, and Oscar voting is underway. Here is our podcast discussion of four films you should know about: &quot;Fences,&quot; &quot;Passengers,&quot; &quot;La La Land&quot; and &quot;Patriots Day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Are my thoughts helping to build me up, or tear me down?&quot; A psychologist asks this question to help overcome negativity. Controlled breathing may help, too. Here are more bits of advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 2017, art lovers can look forward to splashy new museums and exhibitions: The Louvre's outpost in Abu Dhabi will open, London's Victoria &amp; Albert Museum is getting a $50-million-plus upgrade, and the British Library is commemorating the 20th anniversary of the inception of the world's most famous wizard, Harry Potter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have begun the new year with political upheavals spreading across nearly every continent. But 100 years ago, several seismic shifts shaped our modern world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As World War I raged, the monarchy in Russia was collapsing, leading to the formation of the Soviet Union a few years later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finland gained its independence as a result. It's celebrating the anniversary with new passports and special blankets for newborns. The state of Israel hadn't been created by then, but the British foreign secretary's &quot;Balfour Declaration&quot; laid the diplomatic foundation for the state of Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States entered what was then known as the Great War, a milestone in its rise toward becoming a superpower. One lawmaker who voted against sending troops was a historical figure. Jeannette Rankin took office in 1917 as the country's first woman in Congress. She later helped pass the 19th Amendment, giving women voting rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all of this year's centennials, though, are tied to war and politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1917, the United States gave a Swedish immigrant a patent for his &quot;separable fastener,&quot; also known as a zipper. And a Massachusetts resident tinkering in his kitchen concocted something that you might eat for dessert tonight that includes sugar, egg whites and vanilla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's known today as Marshmallow Fluff.</SPAN></P>
