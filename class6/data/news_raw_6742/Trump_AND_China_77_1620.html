<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KOTOR, Montenegro -- Just over an hour after Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> secured his stunning triumph, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia congratulated the victor and looked forward to ''constructive dialogue.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president, Xi Jinping, waited a little longer, sending Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a similarly measured message of hope and appealing for ''cooperation for mutual gain.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps even more revealing was Momcilo Krivokapic, a bearded Orthodox priest who was ecstatic over the upset result. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Seated in the dark at Saint Nikola Church because of a power failure, the 71-year-old priest gloated at ''the defeat of satanic forces'' in the West bent on strengthening NATO, expanding gay rights and championing Western notions of tolerance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''God has reached out his hand and touched the United States to help us all,'' said Father Krivokapic, a bitter foe of the American-led military alliance and of the values that American power has brought to the far corners of the world, even to Kotor, an ancient fortified town on the Adriatic coast of Montenegro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The election of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Tuesday has presented an unexpected gift to leaders -- political, spiritual and ideological -- who resent the encroachment of the West and now rejoice at a result that in their eyes shows how liberal democracy produces nothing but an angry populace and wild unpredictability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has openly questioned some of the basic tenets of America's role in the world. Now his election has stirred confidence in America's biggest rivals, Russia and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, that they will have more room to assert their own strategic interests, whether in Ukraine, the Baltics or the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''A weakened and disorganized West like this will surely bring many more additional strategic opportunities for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University. Mr. Xi, who has been the strongest foreign policy president for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, will be further emboldened, Mr. Shi said, and will be ''even less prudent'' in his foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But beyond that, the election is being viewed as a comeuppance for a country that lectures others about the superiority of American values. While Mr. Putin and his Kremlin aides were restrained in their initial public response to the result, ''undoubtedly, they are drinking Champagne,'' said Gleb O. Pavlovsky, a political consultant who once worked for the Kremlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This, Mr. Pavlovsky said, is ''for two reasons: one political, the other psychological.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Russia, the triumph of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, just five months after Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union, accelerates an unraveling of the Western order, a trend that the Kremlin has worked tirelessly to promote through disinformation and the funding of anti-establishment parties like the National Front in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, far more dependent on economic ties to the West than Russia is, has avoided trying to stoke turbulent populist sentiments in Western countries but, with a shared hostility toward liberal democracy, has moved increasingly close to Russia to form a united authoritarian front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Russian politicians and analysts cheered Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory as an opportunity for Russia to extend its global influence and, possibly, shed economic sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe over Crimea and Ukraine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Putin, speaking to ambassadors presenting their credentials in the Kremlin, sought to play down any expectations in Russia of a sudden warming of now ice-cold relations with Washington. ''We understand and are aware that it will be a difficult path, in view of the degradation that U.S.-Russian relations have unfortunately suffered,'' Mr. Putin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But more important for Russia than any quick gains was a feeling that after years of enduring criticism from Washington over its steady retreat from Western-style democracy, Russia can now point a finger at the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even before Election Day, Russian state-owned news media hammered the same simple message, said Maria Lipman, editor of Counterpoint, a journal published by the Institute for European, Russian and Eurasian Studies, George Washington University: '''Our democracy might not be perfect, but look at theirs. It stinks.'''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The result -- the victory of a businessman who delighted in shredding the conventions of political decorum and of an America-led Western order in place since the end of World War II, has ''proved Russia right,'' Ms. Lipman added, and shown that the United States is ''no shining city on a hill.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Russia, meanwhile, has been busy building its own alternative city, a beacon for all those who long for a more secure, illiberal world rooted in faith and traditional values. At the center of this effort has been Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church and a close ally of Mr. Putin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Wednesday, the patriarch said he was praying for divine assistance for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, adding, ''There's now hope for good changes both domestically and internationally.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like Russia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has long bridled at American complaints about its illiberal ways, rejecting the idea that human rights and free speech are universal values and insisting that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has found its own political model rooted in uniquely Chinese values that put stability above all else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the days before the election, the Chinese government, eager to point out to its citizens the advantages of one-party rule by the Communist Party, used the nastiness of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vs. Clinton contest to warn about the evils of American democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''America is terribly ill,'' wrote Yuan Peng, the vice president of a state-run research center, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Institutes of Contemporary International Relations. His article in The People's Daily, the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party, said the election would be remembered as a ''page of 'dirty, chaotic and poor performance.'''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Xi, the head of the Communist Party, avoided mockery in his congratulatory message to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and emphasized that ''I place great importance on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-U.S. relationship,'' while quietly advising him in coded language to stay out of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> way. Mr. Xi, Chinese state television reported, said he had told the president-elect that he hoped ''to strive with you to uphold the principles of not engaging in conflict or confrontation, and of cooperation for mutual gain.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intentions remained unclear, the very uncertainties of his victory have given the Chinese leader an opportunity to pursue a number of strategic advantages across Asia, analysts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The general line from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be: 'The United States is unreliable. You have to accommodate us,''' said Peter Jennings, the director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Canberra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> delivers on his promise to downgrade America's traditional alliances in Asia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will almost certainly capitalize on an American retreat by trying to push the United States aside in a region Beijing considers its natural sphere of influence. At the same time, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is hoping that he reneges on his pledges to take on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over trade and slap hefty tariffs on its exports to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With his growing Navy, Mr. Xi may now feel emboldened to pursue more control of the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, the major waterway that carries trillions of dollars of the world's trade, and that he insists belongs to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. He will almost certainly use increasingly big financial inducements to pick off smaller countries like the Philippines and Malaysia that were already moving closer to Beijing, and midsize American allies like Australia that are moving closer to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The outcome of the American election, however, may not be all positive for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Feeling abandoned by the United States, and vulnerable to an emboldened and increasingly assertive </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Japan and South Korea could both decide to develop their own nuclear arsenals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In South Korea, where there is a powerful lobby for the country to become a nuclear power, there is about a 50 percent chance of going nuclear, said Andray Abrahamian, associate research director of Choson Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Japanese government called an emergency meeting Wednesday night, to consider its options. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe faced questions about the future shape of the military alliance, but also recognized that the Obama administration's trade pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, was dead. Mr. Abe had taken big political risks at home to win concessions for the trade deal, which Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has vilified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> triumph could also hold peril for Russia, where state media has for weeks presented the billionaire as a much-needed break from the supposedly Russophobic attitudes of President Obama and Hillary Clinton. In a Facebook post, Andrey Loshak, a Russian journalist, predicted that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> entry to the White House would deprive the Kremlin of what has become one of its most potent political tools: blaming the Obama administration for all of Russia's troubles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The worldview planted into Russians' minds that America is to blame for all and every ill, including urine-stained porches and alcoholic neighbors, crumbles. Who is to be hated now?'' Mr. Loshak wrote. ''You can't do without a specter of a good, high-quality enemy these days.''</SPAN></P>
