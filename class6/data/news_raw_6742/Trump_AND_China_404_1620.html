<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress should exercise greater scrutiny over trade and investment practices between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in order to prevent </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from taking advantage of the economic relationship, a congressional commission said in a report released on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its long list of recommendations, the commission advised Congress to authorize a government panel that reviews foreign takeover deals to bar Chinese state-owned companies from acquiring or gaining ''effective control'' of American companies. It also said Congress should ask a government watchdog agency to write a report on whether large-scale outsourcing of manufacturing to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''is leading to the hollowing out of the defense industrial base.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition, the commission suggested ways in which Congress could better bring antidumping cases against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Each year, the U.S.-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economic and Security Review Commission releases a report to Congress with recommendations based on months of research. The commission aims to make suggestions after examining trade, investment and national security issues between the two nations. Its recommendations are not binding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The report this year took a critical look at the free-trade relationship between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- for example, implying that the countries are not competing on a level playing field. It follows a populist airing of grievances over the downsides of free trade and a globalized economy in Western nations this year. That helped lead to the election last week of Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the next United States president and to the vote by Britons in June to leave the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in its recent public statements, has emphasized the tight economic ties between the two major trading partners and said the countries would benefit more from working together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During his campaign, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he would bring manufacturing jobs back to Middle America and consider imposing a 45 percent tariff on Chinese exports, as well as labeling </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a currency manipulator. Some economists have said a trade war with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would harm the United States economy and lead to a recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In September, after prodding from some lawmakers, the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency, said that it would examine whether reviews of foreign purchases should include a stricter look at more types of foreign investments and be broadened to define more industries as important to the nation's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The review process is done by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, which approves most of the foreign purchases that it examines. The report released on Wednesday said it is that panel that Congress should authorize to reject purchases by Chinese state-owned enterprises. Such companies are the main drivers of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new report said Congress should also create an office in the International Trade Administration to identify and bring antidumping and countervailing duty cases. Countervailing duties are imposed on goods to offset the fact that the goods may have been made with the help of subsidies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Besides trade and investment, the report covers topics like security relations, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> global footprint and the United States' rebalancing to Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In one section, the authors criticize what they see as meager American government efforts to block intelligence collection by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The Obama administration has expressed concern over what it sees as state-sponsored hacking from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The U.S. government response to the threat from Chinese intelligence collection has suffered from the lack of an integrated, coordinated effort within the U.S. intelligence community,'' the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The U.S. government's efforts to counter Chinese intelligence collection operations have manifested largely as a series of espionage prosecutions rather than a strategic, whole-of-government response,'' it added. ''The Obama administration has taken steps to improve cybersecurity among U.S. government agencies and defense contractors, but these measures could mitigate, not eliminate, the significant cyberespionage threats to these organizations.''</SPAN></P>
