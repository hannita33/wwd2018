<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- Hillary Clinton is blunt, negative on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, friendly toward homosexuals, and female -- all reasons some Chinese give for not wanting to see her as the next president of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is highly qualified, visionary, caring, and will support women and children and development around the world -- reasons others give for wanting her to win the November election. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> looks ahead to a new American administration, opinions on the front-running Mrs. Clinton veer from admiration, mostly among women and civil libertarians, to distaste, mostly among male policy makers and an often nationalistic public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the presumptive Republican nominee, has his critics in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, too, but his brand of shock-populism attracts more vocal support in a society where a woman has never sat in the inner circle of power, the Standing Committee of the Communist Party's Politburo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders would rather see Mrs. Clinton in the White House than the ''volatile'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing and an adviser to the State Council, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is volatile, and the worst situation is instability,'' Mr. Shi said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economy and it needs a good relationship with the United States, now more than ever, Mr. Shi said, adding that his comments were his own and did not necessarily represent the leadership. ''This is very sensitive,'' he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders traditionally do not comment publicly on American presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is an autocrat,'' he continued. ''Maybe, with some luck, you can make some trade-offs with him. But if he became president, he would take quite a protective and nationalist policy towards every country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Personally, I prefer the lesser of the two evils,'' he said. ''If she becomes the U.S. president, we are familiar with her.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Chinese policy makers, that familiarity may offer limited comfort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although Mrs. Clinton is seen as having pushed for stronger Chinese-United States ties at the beginning of her tenure in 2009 as President Obama's secretary of state, and is credited in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with facilitating an annual dialogue between top Chinese and American officials, she also angered Beijing by pressing for ''the pivot,'' Mr. Shi said. This rebalancing of United States power toward the Asia-Pacific region, in response to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> growing assertiveness, was seen as an effort to ''contain'' a rising </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and it rankled some top officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then too, ''when she conducted U.S. foreign policy on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Iran, Russia, during the 'Arab Spring''' in 2011, Mr. Shi said, ''her language and style of discourse were direct and much more blunt than Obama's on issues such as human rights and website control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The impression she left in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is quite negative. She criticized the Chinese government's control over information freedom, said it was not compatible with international norms,'' he continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Chinese people liked her husband. Bill Clinton was a very nice guy. Obama is also a nice guy. No one says Hillary is a very nice lady.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lin Lin does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I really admire her,'' said Ms. Lin, 36, an events manager in Beijing. ''Hillary has many years of experience in politics as first lady, and in her personal career she dedicated herself to politics. I think she's very smart and a much better person than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''As a female professional, I do want Hillary, because the difficulties she has met didn't stop her but made her strong. She's a heroine.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet it is not just a feminist issue, Ms. Lin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''My friends, female and male, like Hillary because of her experience, not because she is a woman,'' she said. ''I think she is a good leader. She should do what her country requires her to do. I totally understand.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Mrs. Clinton wins, Chinese leaders will face a president with experience in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> going back decades, when she mainstreamed women's rights in 1995 by declaring at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing that ''women's rights are human rights.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Guo Jianmei, a lawyer and feminist, was there that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''People crowded onto chairs to hear her,'' Ms. Guo said. ''She had charisma, style, knowledge, strength.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not long afterward, Ms. Guo founded </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first feminist legal aid center, the Beijing Zhongze Women's Legal Counseling and Service Center. In February, the authorities closed it as part of a continuing crackdown on civil libertarian groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Guo said that since 1995, she has met Mrs. Clinton six times, in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I feel there's something else special about her,'' Ms. Guo said. ''I feel like she has a really global view of development. Not just for women, but on overall issues, including the economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The conference on women's rights might have influenced Mrs. Clinton's views on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr. Shi suggested, saying she was ''not affectionate'' toward the Communist Party. It took place at the height of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> one-child policy, when many women were being forced to have abortions, among other abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''One thing is consistent,'' Mr. Shi said. ''She has always been quite negative towards </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> human rights situation. We don't know if it was the Beijing women's conference, maybe that had some effect.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, he said that Mrs. Clinton's election would offer some pluses for policy makers in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She was really one of the major advocates for special parts of the relationship with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' Mr. Shi said. ''She appealed very much for the great power relationship. She personally pushed a lot for the creation of the S&amp;ED,'' the annual United States-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strategic and Economic Dialogue, which held its first meeting in 2009.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That optimism may be out of date, with Mrs. Clinton growing more critical as she settled into the job of secretary of state. In 2010, in a speech in Hanoi, Vietnam, she laid down a gauntlet to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, saying the United States had a vital interest in maintaining freedom of navigation in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. This infuriated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which claims most of the sea as its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Six years later, friction is never far away. When Mrs. Clinton posted on Twitter last year that President Xi Jinping was ''shameless'' in connection with the detention of five feminists, Global Times, a leading state-run newspaper, hit back, saying that Mrs. Clinton was learning how to be a ''big mouth'' -- from Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Chinese social media, comments on Mrs. Clinton often focus on her gender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Her femaleness makes her unpopular,'' Mr. Shi said, adding that her image on the internet in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is of ''a harsh lady.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even in the Paper, an online news site that caters to an educated, politically interested elite, readers' comments can be both sexist and ageist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That woman is so old, why isn't she at home taking care of children?'' commented Da Peng on a report of the F.B.I.'s investigation into the 68-year-old Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. (In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the retirement age for most men is 60, while for women it is 55 for civil servants and employees of state enterprises and 50 for most others.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A barrage of critical comments about Mrs. Clinton's attendance at a gay pride event in New York also showed unease with her support for gay rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She must support this from her heart because she's one of them,'' wrote Chunni18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But comments on a Sanlian Life Weekly article about a campaign event in May, when Mrs. Clinton was photographed with two shirtless male supporters, showed that she has admirers, too, amid growing awareness of gender and sexuality issues in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With thumbs up and smiley faces, several commenters who speculated that the men were gay expressed their support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The LGBT community has long backed Mrs. Clinton,'' wrote Yunzhou manbu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ultimately, Mr. Shi held out hope that a Clinton presidency would not mean an upheaval in relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If Obama was 70 percent negative about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, she's 75 to 80 percent,'' he said. ''It's not too much more.''</SPAN></P>
