<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- The founder of a Chinese brand of high-tech toilets called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he had no intention of soiling the name of America's next president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zhong Jiye, the founder, said he had not heard of Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when he registered the English name of his company, Shenzhen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Industrial Company Limited, as a trademark in 2002. In Chinese, the company name means ''innovate universally,'' he said, highlighting how the toilet seats warm and wash the user's backside. That Chinese name, he explained, also sounds a little like ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We really didn't know of this person called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' Mr. Zhong said in a telephone interview from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. ''It was entirely a coincidence.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the United States, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name has adorned ties, steaks, water and other products. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it is found on computers, cosmetics, even leather goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The difference: Many such Chinese products don't have the president-elect's permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of the 46 registered trademarks under the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 29 appear to be owned by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, based on data with the country's trademark office. At least 14 companies not associated with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> applied for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trademark in 2015 and 2016 alone, according to Itaotm, a Chinese commercial trademark website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The situation highlights the difficulties that big brands and celebrities face as they navigate the country's relatively new trademark laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, trademarks are generally awarded to those who are first to file with the government. That has given rise to a crush of people registering the names of well-known brands, in a practice known as ''trademark squatting.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many Western companies like Apple and Starbucks have been caught up in long legal battles to win the right to use their names in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In May, a Chinese company won the right to sell its leather goods under the iPhone trademark after years of legal wrangling with Apple. Michael Jordan lost the rights to the name he is known by in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. New Balance paid $16 million in damages for what a court said was the illegal use of the Chinese name for the company, which a person had trademarked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's very difficult to prove bad faith,'' said Matthew Dresden, a lawyer with Harris Moure in Seattle who specializes in Chinese intellectual property law. ''It's very hard to prove that your name is well known at the time that the application is filed.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has fought at least once to get his name back. In 2015, he lost a legal battle against a businessman in the northern province of Liaoning, Dong Wei, to prevent him from using the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name for a construction company, according to a website run by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Supreme Court. Then the decision was reversed. A notice issued on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trademark office website on Sunday said that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trademark had been granted preliminary approval for use in construction services. The Wall Street Journal reported the decision on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alan Garten, general counsel of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> isn't the first world leader wrapped up in a name dispute in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2004, the country's government officials were not favorably inclined when a Chinese businessman tried to register the Chinese name of former President George W. Bush for a brand of disposable diapers. The officials said the application was likely to be rejected ''because it may bring about bad social impact if a leader's name is registered as a trademark,'' according to state media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zhong, of the toilet maker Shenzhen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said he had not received a challenge from Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or his company. Still, he said, he ''will never'' give up his trademark easily, if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decides to sue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Litigating is his right,'' Mr. Zhong said. ''But we will let the government make its judgment. We believe the country's laws will protect businesses like us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Zhong said he approved of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''courageous style and spirit of reform.'' He also liked Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''innovative ideas.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When asked about the criticism directed toward Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the United States, Mr. Zhong said, ''Democratic countries are like that. I think a transformation is not bad at all.''</SPAN></P>
