<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Obama commuted most of the sentence of Chelsea Manning, the army intelligence analyst convicted of an enormous 2010 leak to WikiLeaks that revealed U.S. military and diplomatic activities around the world. She will be free in five months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision will likely come up at Mr. Obama's final news conference today, along with other legacy issues, like the fight to preserve the Affordable Care Act.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report found that repealing major provisions of Obamacare would cost 18 million people medical insurance in the first year, a number that could increase to 32 million in 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Xi Jinping of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continues a visit to Switzerland, with stops at the U.N. in Geneva and the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Xi, who made a forceful argument for free trade, international integration and climate responsibility at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday, appears to be positioning </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a global leader in sharp contrast to the incoming U.S. president, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Rigged.&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hit back at a poll that put his favorability rating at 40 percent, compared with President Obama's 79 percent before inauguration and George W. Bush's 62 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senate hearings for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cabinet picks continue on a packed schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And officials are putting the final touches on days of celebrations for his inauguration on Friday, which will also be surrounded by protests. Security costs could top $100 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Australia's transport minister did not rule out future underwater searches for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, but said that investigators were certain the jet is not on the seabed in the area that searchers had scoured for nearly three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision, while expected, drew criticism from families of the 239 people who were on board</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jay Y. Lee, the Samsung vice chairman, is expected to attend a hearing and then be held in detention - possibly overnight - to await the decision of a judge in Seoul on whether he should be arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lee has denied accusations that he paid more than $36 million in bribes to organizations linked to Choi Soon-sil, the unofficial adviser at the center of the corruption scandal that engulfed President Park Geun-hye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> British American Tobacco is buying all of Reynolds American that it did not already own. The $49 billion deal, if approved by shareholders and regulators, will reshape the global tobacco industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Motors  became the latest company to highlight initiatives following Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pressure to bolster U.S. manufacturing, announcing a $1 billion investment in American factories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rolls-Royce, the maker of aircraft engines and electric-power turbines, agreed to pay $817 million to resolve corruption inquiries by Britain, the U.S. and Brazil, including accusations of wrongdoing in Indonesia and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> India's democracy includes 287 million illiterate people, so party symbols matter. This week, a feud over the image of a bicycle that had split a powerful political dynasty was resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Each spring, poplar trees planted by the millions under Mao blanket Chinese cities with cottonlike balls of fluff. In Beijing, the government hopes to eliminate the fuzz forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And we introduce The Long View, in which the historian Jon Meacham looks at books that speak to historical and cultural moments. This first installment looks at the chaotic U.S. of the 1930s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oval Office is often used as shorthand for the U.S. presidency, but did you know that fewer than half of the presidents have worked there?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During President Theodore Roosevelt's term (1901-09), the West Wing was added to hold the executive branch's growing staff. He had a rectangular-shaped office in the addition (now called the Roosevelt Room).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier leaders worked in the residence, mostly in what is known as the Lincoln Bedroom. Roosevelt's successor, William H. Taft, had the Oval Office built and was its first occupant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The design wasn't novel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Washington had oval-shaped rooms in Philadelphia in 1791, allowing him to greet guests circled around him. The pomp mimics an English court tradition called the lev&eacute;e.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a White House precursor, too. The Blue Room is rounded and used for diplomatic receptions. In the family quarters, there's a Yellow Oval Room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Christmas Eve in 1929, the Oval Office was badly damaged in a fire. President Franklin Roosevelt renovated it, moving it closer to the residence. The &quot;commute&quot; is under a minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidents can redecorate, but there are limits. One is that the presidential seal must remain on the ceiling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there's an other tradition: the outgoing president leaves a letter on the desk for his successor.</SPAN></P>
