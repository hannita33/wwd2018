</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good evening. Here's the latest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke with the president of Taiwan, a striking break from decades of diplomatic practice that could cause a major rift with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was back in New York after Thursday's victory tour in Indiana and Ohio. Emotions are still raw from the campaign, evidenced during an angry debatebetween top strategists from the campaigns of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Hillary Clinton.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters filed legal challenges to stop recount efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will inherit an unusually strong economy, with the official unemployment rate, 4.6 percent, at its lowest level in more than nine years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employers added 178,000 workers in November, clearing the way for the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark interest rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Housing prices are up, consumer confidence is high and the American economy grew by a healthy 3.2 percent during the third quarter. But millions of workers continue to feel the recovery has passed them by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. We've taken a closer look at the complications Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will face in fulfilling some of his campaign promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On immigration, his plan to deport millions of immigrants could be stalled by courts that are already crippled by a backlog of more than 520,000 cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if he follows through on punishing countries he deems guilty of unfair trade, American manufacturers who rely on imports to build their products could be hurt as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A jury in Charleston  signaled that it was within a single vote of convicting a white former police officer in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Video of the shooting, which showed Michael Slager, above left, firing shots at Walter Scott as he fled after a traffic stop last year, rocketed into the national consciousness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot in good conscience consider a guilty verdict,&quot; a single, unidentified juror wrote in a letter to the judge. &quot;We may never reach a unanimous decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A man arrested in the fatal shooting of Joe McKnight, above, a former N.F.L. player, was released without charge, sparking outrage on social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law enforcement officials in Louisiana, where the shooting happened on Thursday, said it might have been spurred by a &quot;possible road rage incident&quot; and remained under investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKnight played for the New York Jets before the team cut him in 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Italy's prime minister, Matteo Renzi, may be the next leader crushed by the wave of populist anger that has upended political establishments in Europe and the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Renzi has vowed to resign if voters reject a measure to overhaul the country's constitution in a referendum on Sunday. Polls indicate that the measure may fail, largely because of disillusioned young voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In West Africa, voters in Gambia ousted a strongman who had reigned for 22 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Friday marks one year since a married couple attacked public health employees in San Bernardino, Calif., killing 14 and seriously injuring 22 others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For survivors, like Amanda Gaspard, above with her parents, the long road to recovery has been complicated by repeated denials for medical care. Because the shooting was a workplace attack, a restrictive workers' compensation system is responsible for their coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. A tournament that bills itself as the Super Bowl of double dutch will have its 25th anniversary on Sunday in Harlem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The schoolyard game, which was adopted and perfected by black girls in urban American communities after World War II, has fallen out of favor in the neighborhoods where it was born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But its appeal has spread abroad: Teams from France and Japan will be competing this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. For the first time in more than 100 years, the Metropolitan Opera in New York is performing a work composed by a woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opera, &quot;L'Amour de Loin&quot; (&quot;Love From Afar&quot;) by Kaija Saariaho, above, debuted this week with a female conductor, Susanna Malkki, as well. Ms. Malkki became only the fourth woman to take the podium in the company's history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Finally, let us introduce you to the participants of this year's Ms. Senior America Pageant, a celebration of women of a certain age - &quot;between 60 and death,&quot; one contestant joked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are doctors and nurses, business owners and executives. Some have escaped wars, survived illnesses and lost loved ones. And yet, they are still kicking - and kicking high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no swimsuit competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
