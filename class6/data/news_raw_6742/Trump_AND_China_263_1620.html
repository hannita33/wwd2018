<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WARREN, Mich. -- In a full-throttled rejection of Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic policies, Hillary Clinton on Thursday accused him of feigning a connection to the working man, while advocating policies that would ''work for him and his friends, at the expense of everyone else.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seeking to chip away at the perception among working-class white voters that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the economic populist in the race, Mrs. Clinton said the Republican nominee merely paid ''lip service'' to being on the side of average Americans. She repeatedly contrasted his personal wealth with her own middle-class upbringing. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is a myth out there that he'll stick it to the rich and powerful because, somehow, at heart, he's really on the side of the little guy,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''Don't believe it.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton referred to the tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presented in a speech in Detroit on Monday, saying he ''wants to give trillions in tax breaks to people like himself,'' which would lead to broad cuts in spending on education, health care and environmental protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although she has attacked Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business record for months, her address on Thursday presented the first opportunity for Mrs. Clinton to deliver a detailed point-by-point rebuttal to the economic proposals Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unveiled this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The nearly back-to-back addresses on the economy put into sharp relief the candidates' contrasting positions on an issue that has preoccupied voters throughout the lengthy presidential contest, with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seizing on economic dislocation in mixing populist anti-trade positions with traditionally Republican tax cutting, and Mrs. Clinton seeing a strong government hand in creating jobs and driving up wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton called for making the biggest infrastructure investment -- $275 billion -- since World War II, and urged aggressive spending on green energy to counter </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Germany. And she repeated her plans to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for in-state middle-class families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And she sharply criticized important elements of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tax cut plans, particularly the elimination of the estate tax and his plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent; she said his plan for business owners included what she called the ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> loophole,'' which would ''allow him to pay less than half the current tax rate on income from many of his own companies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She characterized her opponent's economic doctrine as a ''more extreme version of the failed theory of trickle-down economics'' mixed with his own ''outlandish Trumpian ideas that even Republicans reject.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And she rejected Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promises to ease financial regulation and do away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which he calls detrimental to average Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Even conservative experts say </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agenda will pull our economy back into recession,'' and cause the loss of 3.4 million jobs, Mrs. Clinton said, pointing to an analysis for Moody's Analytics led by Mark Zandi, who advised Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton's remarks often transcended policy, as she sought to portray Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as an out-of-touch businessman who would squash the working class. She talked about her grandfather's years of labor in a lace mill in Scranton, Pa., and her father's small drapery-printing business in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is personal for me,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''I am the product of the American middle class.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But for all of her efforts, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remains a difficult opponent to critique in traditional ideological terms. Although some of his policies align with those of congressional Republicans, others, like his promise to rip up global trade agreements, break with Republican orthodoxy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And unlike Mitt Romney, whom President Obama effectively portrayed as a cold corporate titan in the 2012 race, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> enjoys some of his strongest support among working-class white voters who believe he cares about people like them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The issue of trade particularly hurt Mrs. Clinton in the primary in Michigan, which is heavily reliant on manufacturing jobs. She narrowly lost the state to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who, like Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, sharply criticized Mrs. Clinton for her previous support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, which her husband signed into law, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she supported as secretary of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Before Mrs. Clinton's speech, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> used an address to the National Association of Home Builders in Miami Beach to assail former President Bill Clinton for signing Nafta into law, which Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said devastated upstate New York, and he hammered Mrs. Clinton for failing to deliver on a promise she made in her 2000 Senate campaign to bring 200,000 jobs to the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She passed no legislation that helped,'' he said. ''She couldn't get out of her own way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Clinton gave her address after touring the Futuramic Tool &amp; Engineering factory in Warren, which made automotive parts in the past but has diversified to supply parts to the aerospace industry. Praising the company for being at the front line of a potential ''manufacturing renaissance,'' Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for taking a dark view of America's potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''When Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> visited Detroit on Monday, he talked only of failure, poverty and crime,'' she said. ''He's missing so much.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton has spent over a year explaining her main economic proposals and did not propose anything new on Thursday. But she did contrast her specific promises with those Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> offered on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She mocked Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plan to give tax breaks for child care -- the brainchild of his daughter Ivanka and intended to appeal to middle-class mothers -- as a boon to rich families with nannies. And, in contrast to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> corporate tax reductions, she said she would impose an ''exit tax'' to penalize companies that move jobs overseas and offer tax incentives to companies that share profits with employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Then there's the estate tax, which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to eliminate altogether,'' she said. ''If you believe that he's as wealthy as he says, that alone would save the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family $4 billion.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But on one issue that has resonated with working-class voters, Mrs. Clinton played defense on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Halfway through the speech, she paused. The crowd grew quiet. ''I'm sure some of you are thinking, well, that all sounds good, but what about trade?'' she said. ''After all, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> talks about it all the time.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While reiterating her opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, she belittled Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tough talk on trade as empty, noting how he makes </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-branded products overseas. ''Before he tweets about how he's really one who'll put 'America First' in trade, let's remember where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> makes many of his own products,'' she said. ''Because it is sure not America.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Outside the factory setting, a scattering of pro-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protesters held ''Hillary for Prison'' signs and criticized Mrs. Clinton's connections to Wall Street. And more than 1,000 miles away in Florida, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> echoed that critique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She doesn't have the talent'' to jump-start the economy, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. ''If she wanted to do it, she couldn't because her donors won't let her.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Wielding a chart, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the Obama administration's policies that Mrs. Clinton wants to continue have led to plummeting home ownership rates and anemic economic growth. He also suggested that Mrs. Clinton wanted to raise taxes by $1.3 trillion and place more of that burden on the middle class -- something that she  has not proposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Many workers are earning less money in real dollars than they were in 1970,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. ''And then you wonder why they're angry.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In her speech, Mrs. Clinton tried to address voters' anger over income inequality, but she also tried to frame her plans as the optimistic flip side of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pessimistic assessment of the country's economic prospects, pointing to two Olympic gold medalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If Team U.S.A. was as fearful as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' she said, ''Michael Phelps and Simone Biles would be cowering in the locker room.''</SPAN></P>
