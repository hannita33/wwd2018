<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The morning after the election, my black daughter asked me if Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory will mean that vigilantism, homophobia and racial violence will become acceptable. Will immigrants be attacked on our Southern border? Will black churches burn?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I told her that I didn't think so, that most Americans were bigger than that, but my words were only those of a concerned father.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday at the drinking fountain, my 10-year-old biracial son overheard a white student taunt an Asian student, &quot;If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wins today, you'll be going back to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; He wasn't even Chinese. The day before, at my 15-year-old daughter's school, a cafeteria table full of girls started chanting, &quot;Build the wall!&quot; as she and her African-American and Muslim friends sat silently staring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many students have taken to social media with similar language, like &quot;send the minorities back.&quot; I live in New York, not a Southern or rust belt state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a lawyer, I am horrified about whether Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mike Pence will make good on their promise to oppose vital laws protecting access to health care, fighting climate change, honoring treaties and ensuring gun control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the father of a mixed-raced daughter, I am scared about whether their hateful words about women and minorities will be reflected in their policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I am mostly scared as a gay man. The Republican Party platform doesn't include anti-gay policies only to motivate the party's base. It includes them because most (not all) of its members intend to pursue those policies at the federal, state and local level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I realize that eliminating equal protection of gay families was not the issue motivating most people to vote for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mr. Pence. But that is no comfort to the millions of diverse families in the United States today who find their equality once again at risk.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My 10-year-old daughter learned a lot during the election campaign: that most of the time it's O.K. to lie; that not paying your debts and taxes is just fine; that people who are different are suspect; that having a stranger grope you is no big deal; that reading and preparedness are overrated and that science is a hoax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, that it's O.K. never to admit mistakes; that bullying pays off; and that ugliness, hatred and violence are appropriate responses to disagreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is apparently how more than 60 million Americans feel: enough to elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> president. Nevertheless, I will do my best to counter these twisted beliefs and encourage my daughter to treat all people fairly and to choose only leaders who respect the law, embrace difference and give more than they take.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re &quot;Taking My Daughters to Vote&quot; (Op-Ed, Nov. 9):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jennifer Weiner succeeded in evoking tears in this aging grandpa. How sad that among other things this election may be read by some as a green light for the misogyny of the president-elect and so many others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would only hope that Ms. Weiner remembers the tens of millions of American men for whom the &quot;boys will be boys&quot; excuse doesn't wash. We reject the objectification of women demonstrated in this election and try to treat our female loved ones and associates just as we want to be treated ourselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Weiner should not let her daughters lose their belief in themselves and in their dreams. We want the same for our daughters, too. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I sent a version of the following email to my daughters:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dear Sam and Meryl,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know that I am not particularly political, but this presidential campaign really touched a nerve. I was so proud that you had a chance to see a smart, educated, accomplished woman lead her party and run for president. When I was your age, it still didn't seem possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always wanted you to know that there were no limits as to what you could accomplish. Hillary Clinton was an inspiration for that. And I am so disappointed and disheartened that our country chose as our president a man who thinks nothing of demeaning women, attacking them physically and deriding them verbally. No one has the right to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since I have taken the time to tap this out with one finger on my phone, you know how important this is to me. It's too late to change the outcome of this election, but let's be galvanized and not be beaten down by it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Love and xxxx. Mom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
