<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;To take on a leadership role to promote the Paris Agreement, as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has indicated it wants to do, Beijing will have to be more transparent on emissions.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING - President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has called climate change a &quot;hoax&quot; created by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and said he would withdraw from the global Paris Agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That threat has lent new urgency to a question that has loomed over the agreement since it was signed in 2015: whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will properly report and submit its carbon emissions data for verification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like some other nations, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the world's biggest polluter, has refused to accept international monitoring of its emissions and says it will provide data to outside observers. In the past, conflicting data about the country's energy use has raised questions about accuracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under President Obama, American officials worked to pressure </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other developing nations to provide more accurate data, viewing that as a difficult but critical part of establishing clear global benchmarks in climate change policy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has indicated that it wants to take on a leadership role to promote the Paris Agreement. But if Washington withdraws or lets up on its demands, the incentives for Beijing to do that through greater transparency will be greatly reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Paris Agreement rests on a foundation of transparency and good faith: Countries are supposed to report and submit for verification their carbon emissions data. Without accurate and timely reporting, there is no way to monitor progress and adjust policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International negotiators are expected to draw up standards that will apply to both developed and developing countries, unlike the bifurcated reporting requirements of older climate deals. This means that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and India will be compelled to provide the same kinds of information as, say, France and Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a summit meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco, in November, officials discussed a plan to establish standards and mechanisms for reporting emissions. Over the next two years, negotiators will engage in &quot;the most technically complex and politically contentious issues,&quot; said Li Shuo, a Beijing-based climate policy analyst at Greenpeace East Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he said, &quot;still has a long way to improve its transparency system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A country's greenhouse gas output is determined by extrapolating data about energy use rather than directly measuring it. Accurate annual coal consumption statistics are critical for these calculations because industrial coal burning is the biggest source of greenhouse gas pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coal statistics are subject to official corrections and changes, and updates are released just once every five years, when the country conducts an economic census.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last census revealed that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coal-derived energy use was 12 to 14 percent higher than previous estimates for every year since 2005. Furthermore, there are persistent differences between coal consumption statistics reported on the provincial and national levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over time, it would be desirable if the reporting systems are improved,&quot; said Glen Peters, a scientist at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research-Oslo. &quot;The fact that the census leads to 10 percent revisions in such an important commodity is a little worrying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added, &quot;The U.S., for example, also has revisions, but generally less than 1 percent in the first year and maybe 0.1 percent in following years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem is that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been reluctant to release its own calculations of emissions, so other nations rely on calculations made by foreign scientists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese government has submitted emissions estimates to the United Nations only twice, for 1994 and 2005. Most other developing nations have also submitted only two estimates, but some, including Brazil and Mexico, have submitted three or more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is &quot;no good reason&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is dragging its feet, said Mr. Li, the Greenpeace analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Paris Agreement, countries will have to submit estimates every two years. &quot;International forces are quite attractive in terms of putting pressure on improving the transparency system,&quot; Mr. Li said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a news conference in Beijing in November, Xie Zhenhua, a special envoy on climate issues, said that although he believed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> data was accurate, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was still a developing nation and struggling to establish the same type of reporting and verification systems that developed nations used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was mentioned in the Paris agreement that a greater degree of flexibility should be offered to developing countries, and, first of all, funding and technical support should be provided to them to help improve their capacity,&quot; Mr. Xie said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How to establish a system of transparency should only be considered on this basis,&quot; he added. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is also in such a phase of development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will compile emissions data from four data sources: national and provincial governments, businesses, and a planned cap-and-trade carbon market, said Chai Qimin, a senior director at the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The different areas of reporting &quot;can be used to check against one another,&quot; he said. &quot;At least major discrepancies won't happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Chai and other climate researchers and policy advisers played down how large the carbon market would be by the end of 2017. They said Chinese officials had said only that the market would &quot;launch,&quot; not be fully operational.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been experimenting with seven regional pilot cap-and-trade markets. Mr. Xie, the climate envoy, said that as of September, the cumulative total turnover of carbon dioxide in those pilot markets was 120 million metric tons, and the cumulative transaction amount had exceeded 3.2 billion renminbi, or $473 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some experts say a carbon tax would be a better way of putting a cost on carbon. Other scholars say the pilot programs have suffered from operational problems that could bode ill for the national market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I estimate that it will surely be launched in 2017, although there will be many difficulties, and the progress is unlikely to be fast,&quot; said Jiang Kejun, a senior researcher at the Energy Research Institute, part of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economic Development Agency. &quot;For it to truly play a vital role, I think we'll have to wait until 2019 or 2020.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any case, researchers say, other market forces are helping for now. They expect coal consumption in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to remain flat or drop, as has been the trend in the past two years. That is mainly because of the slowing Chinese economy. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promised two years ago that its greenhouse gas emissions would peak in 2030 - a goal that experts now say will be met easily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some are even suggesting that emissions may have already begun to drop for the long term, though an emissions peak can be confirmed only years after it has happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Peters's group estimated that carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel consumption and cement production in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fell 0.5 percent in 2015 from the year before. Those kinds of numbers have been a pleasant surprise for climate negotiators and researchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, the Chinese National Energy Administration announced a plan for 2016 to 2020 in which the country would spend $360 billion on renewable energy sources and create more than 13 million jobs in that sector. A related coal plan predicted marginal growth in coal consumption, estimating that the amount consumed in 2020 would be 4.1 billion metric tons, a 3.5 percent increase over 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Li said the five-year energy plans constantly overestimated </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> energy needs. Greenpeace calculations show annual coal consumption dropped in 2016, he said, and &quot;it is hard to see how a 100-million-ton growth of coal would be possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
