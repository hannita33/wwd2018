</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - On the morning of Jan. 21, 2017, his first full day in office, President Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will take a minute to settle behind the 19th-century Resolute desk, first used in the Oval Office by John F. Kennedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then he will get very busy - if he follows through on his campaign promises for what he will do on his first day in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Day 1, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has promised, he will redirect immigration enforcement, alter trade relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other nations, relax restrictions on energy production, impose new rules on lobbyists, halt efforts to combat global warming, lift curbs on guns, push for congressional term limits and demand a new strategy for defeating the Islamic State. He may face some legal and procedural hurdles, but most of his Day 1 pledges involve issuing presidential directives, executive orders or memorandums that do not need legislative approval.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his top advisers have appeared to moderate some of his broader campaign pledges - they have suggested he might keep parts of the Affordable Care Act, delay building a wall along the border with Mexico and not appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton's emails - Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said nothing to indicate that he will not make good on his explicit Day 1 promises, many of which he delivered in his &quot;Contract With the American Voter&quot; during a speech in late October in Gettysburg, Pa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moving quickly is, after all, a modern presidential tradition. On his first day in office, President Obama imposed lobbying rules, closed secret interrogation facilities, banned torture and ordered the prison at Guant&aacute;namo Bay closed (an order that Congress has blocked to this day). Bowing to conservatives, on his first day, President George W. Bush ended funding of overseas clinics that provided abortion services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is what Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he will do:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowhere has Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> been more specific than in his desire to deal with immigration on his first day. During a campaign rally on Aug. 31 in Phoenix, he told the crowd that he would instruct his administration to begin deporting illegal immigrants with criminal records immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will begin moving them out, Day 1,&quot; he said. &quot;My first hour in office, those people are gone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, immigration enforcement agents at the Department of Homeland Security are already under a mandate from Mr. Obama to deport criminals. The executive actions the president took in late 2014 order officials to focus on deporting &quot;national security threats, convicted felons, gang members and illegal entrants apprehended at the border.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does have wide latitude to direct an even more aggressive deportation effort, and he appears determined to do so quickly. He has said he will immediately end Mr. Obama's program that protects undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as young children. But it is unclear whether Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will seek to quickly deport the 700,000 or so people who signed up for the program, or merely refuse to accept new applicants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has said he also plans on Day 1 to suspend immigration from &quot;terror-prone&quot; countries, and to impose &quot;extreme vetting&quot; on others. And he has said he will immediately inform sanctuary cities - about two dozen American cities where officials have pledged not to prosecute people solely for being undocumented - that they will lose federal funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economy and Trade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign was built on a promise to help struggling American workers who are frustrated by the loss of jobs, especially in the heartland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect has said he intends to take several actions to pursue those policies on his first day, including announcing his intention to renegotiate or withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement and to stop pursuing adoption of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Both actions are well within Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> powers as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has promised to pick up the phone and order his Treasury secretary to label </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a currency manipulator, and to tell his commerce secretary to begin identifying foreign trade abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has also said he will call chief executives of major companies who have announced plans to move jobs overseas to warn them that he will impose 35 percent tariffs if they proceed. That promise may be difficult to keep: Tariffs require congressional approval, and the Constitution bans the imposition of taxes or tariffs specifically aimed at a single company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Environment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect has taken direct aim at Mr. Obama's actions on the environment and climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said that on his first day in office, he will lift Obama-era rules that restrict where oil drilling and other energy production are done, although Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may find it harder to change those plans than he thinks. In July, for example, Mr. Obama's administration issued regulations making it harder to drill for oil in the Arctic by requiring extensive plans for containing spills. Undoing final regulations like the Arctic drilling rules would require a long legal process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be easier to reconsider Mr. Obama's ruling against construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would bring petroleum from Canada's oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he will indicate on his first day his desire to approve the pipeline. And he has promised to call United Nations officials the same day to inform them he is canceling United States' financial commitments to United Nations climate change programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Day 1 Promises</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At some point that day, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said, he will convene a meeting of senior Pentagon officials to discuss the threat posed by the Islamic State and other terrorist groups. &quot;I am also going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction: They will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for defeating ISIS,&quot; as the Islamic State is also known, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in Greenville, N.C., during the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect has also promised to act to get rid of gun-free zones around schools and other facilities, a nod to Second Amendment supporters. &quot;My first day, it gets signed, O.K.?&quot; he said at a January rally. &quot;My first day. There's no more gun-free zones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that may be a tough promise to keep. Gun-free zones are a result of a 1990 law proposed by Joseph R. Biden Jr., then a senator, and ending them would require legislation that Congress is unlikely to pass on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first day in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be easier to make good on his promises to attack corruption in Washington. He has said he will propose term limits for members of Congress, impose restrictions on the creation of new regulations, and limit the lobbying activities of White House and congressional officials after they leave office.</SPAN></P>
