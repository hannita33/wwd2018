</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction Appended</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> released an infomercial-style YouTube video in which he said his transition was going &quot;very smoothly, efficiently and effectively&quot; and listed priorities for his first day in office, including starting the process of withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. <BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil rights groups called on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to publicly condemn extremist movements after white nationalists gathered in Washington over the weekend. Video emerged of some of them giving Nazi salutes after a speaker said, &quot;Hail </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect invited television news anchors and executives to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower, where he accused them of dishonesty. He is expected to meet this week with representatives of other news organizations, though he canceled his meeting scheduled for today with The New York Times.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is the latest on the transition and a look at what Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hopes to accomplish in his first 100 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> met with Nigel Farage this month, the president-elect encouraged the British politician to oppose the kind of offshore wind farms he believes will mar the view from one of his Scottish golf courses, according to a person who was present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the president-elect said on Twitter that Mr. Farage, who leads the U.K. Independence Party, would make a &quot;great&quot; ambassador to the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In London, the prime minister's office said there was no vacancy for the post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The importance of one factor that played into the U.S. election is still emerging: the role of fake news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some false stories are produced deliberately, but some build from misinformed social media posts. We look at how one erroneous tweet by a man with just 40 followers exploded through the hyperpartisan blogosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One restaurant is reeling from menacing calls and online abuse after fake stories claimed that Hillary Clinton abused children there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three days of heavy bombing by the Syrian government left more than 250,000 people in eastern Aleppo without hospital care. &quot;It feels like we are living in hell. Our neighborhoods are in flames, and bombs are raining down from the sky,&quot; one doctor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. special envoy to Syria said he feared that the city's east &quot;will not be there by the new year in terms of structural destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Damascus, our reporter described how the civil war has wounded Syria's capital, though it remains bustling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fallout from revelations of Russia's state-run doping program is rewriting the record books for the Beijing and the London Summer Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The retesting of stored urine samples has incriminated at least 40 medal winners, most from Russia and other Eastern European countries. Medals from the 2014 Sochi Olympics are also likely to be called into question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Vatican extended a policy allowing priests to grant forgiveness for abortion, continuing Pope Francis' aim to make the church more welcoming and inclusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But can the 79-year-old pontiff appoint enough like-minded cardinals to ensure that his vision endures? Here's a look at changes in the Vatican's leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investors are betting that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promises of tax cuts, fewer regulations and a spendthrift federal government can recharge the American economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A recently leaked memo has highlighted cabinet divisions over Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. Here's a look at the open questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lufthansa pilots plan to go on strike tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot; cast a spell on international audiences, earning $143 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A powerful earthquake triggered a tsunami off the coast of Japan. A cooling system in a nuclear reactor shut down but was restored without incident. Above, crowds at a train station where services were suspended. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turkey dismissed nearly 15,000 civil servants and military and police officials over purported links to a failed coup in July, bringing the total number of all dismissed since the coup to 110,000. [Reuters]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talks aimed at reunifying Cyprus as a federation have hit an impasse over disputed territory. [The Associated Press]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Allegiances are shifting toward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Asia Pacific as a trade deal excluding the U.S. gains momentum. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The world's best climber, Adam Ondra from the Czech Republic, is taking on the Dawn Wall in the Yosemite Valley of California. He wanted to shatter a record. Now he's just trying to finish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jurgen Klinsmann, the German World Cup-winning striker, lost his job as coach of the U.S. men's national soccer team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William Trevor, the Irish writer, died aged 88. He focused his mournful, darkly funny short stories and novels on &quot;the sadness of fate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The artist Jeff Koons said he will donate a monumental sculpture of a fistful of tulips to Paris to commemorate the victims of terrorist attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quit social media. That's the advice of a university professor who said that doing so could benefit your career. &quot;If you're serious about making an impact in the world,&quot; he said, &quot;power down your smartphone, close your browser tabs, roll up your sleeves and get to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ah, the family road trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every country with cars knows the drill, and this week the United States will see some of its busiest traveling days of the year with the Thanksgiving holiday. AAA predicts that 43.5 million Americans will be on the roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What to do as you're going over the river and through the woods to Grandma's house?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While modern-day comforts, apps and back-of-the-seat screens have made it easier to pass the time while on the road, the games of yesteryear can offer a twinge of nostalgia for adults and a tablet-free option to entertain the kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it's spotting roadside novelties - as in I Spy or Bingo - or vehicles from different states (or countries) - as in the license plate game - most games are variations on a scavenger hunt. (Punch Buggy, which depends on spotting a dwindling supply of old Volkswagen Beetles, could just be an exercise in frustration.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Britain, car snooker adapts the rules of the cue sport on which it's based, requiring players to spot vehicles of different colors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, The Times also collected favorite travel games from readers (one is titled &quot;Guess What I Saw?&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps more important, in the aftermath of a contentious election, getting to dinner might be more fun than the destination itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Stanford contributed reporting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this briefing referred incorrectly to a planned strike by Lufthansa pilots. They plan to go on strike Wednesday, not Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
