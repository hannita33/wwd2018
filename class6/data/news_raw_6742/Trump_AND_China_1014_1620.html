</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Obama's final speech to the nation was marked by nostalgia and hope, though he warned that racial, political and economic challenges still lay ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In parts of the speech, Mr. Obama appeared to be talking to Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, warning him of the dangers of continuing to stoke the divisions that helped Republicans defeat Hillary Clinton in the presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later today, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is expected to give his first news conference since July.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American intelligence agencies briefed the president and the president-elect last week on more than just evidence of Russian hacking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also, it emerged, a two-page summary prepared by political operatives seeking to derail Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> candidacy, which presented unsubstantiated reports that Russia had collected compromising and salacious personal information about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intelligence agencies considered the document, while unsubstantiated, too potentially explosive to keep from President Obama, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and congressional leaders. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dismissed it as a &quot;total political witch hunt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The use of torture was a main theme on the first day of a whirlwind week of U.S. Senate hearings on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cabinet choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His attorney general pick, Senator Jeff Sessions, said that current law made waterboarding &quot;absolutely improper and illegal.&quot; He also distanced himself from Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pledges to bar Muslim immigrants and investigate Mrs. Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in a joint letter, 176 retired officers urged Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not to follow through on campaign vows to bring back torture. Here is the latest on the transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Iran, the authorities largely shrugged off the opposition chants that erupted at the sprawling state funeral for Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who died on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many of those involved in the so-called Green Revolution, the antigovernment demonstrations in 2009, Mr. Rafsanjani was a lone establishment voice representing their beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By official estimates, 2.5 million people attended the funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Volkswagen is on the verge of pleading guilty to criminal charges in the U.S. and paying $4.3 billion in fines to resolve a federal investigation into its cheating on emissions tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutors are also mulling criminal charges against Takata, the Japanese manufacturer under criminal investigation for its defective airbags.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clare Hollingworth, a British journalist and the undisputed doyenne of war correspondents, died in Hong Kong at 105.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was on the border of Germany and Poland in August 1939, just a week into her first job for a British newspaper, when she reported what was probably the greatest scoop of modern times: the start of World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She roamed the conflict zones of the world often equipped with little more than a toothbrush, a typewriter and, if need be, a revolver.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Messaging services like WhatsApp and Gmail will face restrictions in how they track users under a new European Commission proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> E.U. regulators approved French plans to inject 4.5 billion euros into Areva, the struggling maker of nuclear reactor components.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All Dutch trains are now powered by wind energy, the national railway operator N.S. said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concerns over crashing populations of bees, butterflies and other insects that promote plant growth are spreading around the world. U.S. officials made the rusty-patched bumblebee the first pollinator to be added to the endangered species list.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norway is trying to make audio history this week. The country is beginning an experiment to switch off its FM stations and replace them with digital radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the plan succeeds, it could be the beginning of a change in how we listen to radio around the globe. Switzerland, Britain and Denmark are considering the same move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norway, where terrestrial radio remains quite popular, was among the first countries to adopt digital radio in the 1990s. The government's current effort is aimed at improving audio quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was also a goal in the creation of FM radio, which offers staticless, high-fidelity broadcasting. Edwin Armstrong, an American inventor, is credited with figuring out how to transmit sound by modulating the frequency of electromagnetic waves (FM) instead of their amplitude (AM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later built his own FM station to prove its worth to skeptics, though his triumph was marred by legal battles over patents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times called Armstrong one of the &quot;great inventive geniuses in electrical engineering&quot; after his death in 1954. &quot;He always preferred to be the master of his own laboratory. That he was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
