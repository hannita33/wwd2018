<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Editor: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Re ''In a Narrow Race, Many View </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a Change Agent'' (front page, Sept. 16) and ''The Black Eyes in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Life,'' by Nicholas Kristof (column, Sept. 8):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It seems that there's no end to the list of ugly words and deeds in Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> life. What's more, many are already well known, yet he is rising in the polls for reasons no one seems to fully understand. True, the growing economy has left many behind, and ISIS is still a serious threat, but why would anyone think the solution is electing a self-important fraud who knows nothing of government and boasts of a chummy relationship with a head of state who's crushed freedom in his own country?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The larger concern this raises is about our own political system. If our democracy cannot deny the nation's highest office to someone so deeply bigoted, uninformed and untrustworthy as Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, could we be looking at the twilight of democracy itself? Loss of freedom in other countries began the same way, with self-absorbed leaders with similar beliefs and personality traits.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's ironic to be questioning our democracy after the highly successful two terms of our first black president and the first major-party nomination of a woman, but I have to believe that a great many voters do not appreciate how much is at stake for America's future in this election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  DAVID KERNIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Trumbull, Conn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The writer is a retired corporate communications executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Readers React</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I share Mr. Kernis's fears about Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but I don't think his candidacy portends the ''twilight of our democracy.'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is an affront to a great many Americans but not, obviously, to all. Be that as it may, it is the very nature of democracy that enables a candidate as grievously unqualified by experience and temperament to grab the baton and run with it. As Winston Churchill observed, democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others. The founders knew this, and established a divided government of checks and balances that for more than 200 years has withstood constitutional crises and survived: the Civil War, F.D.R.'s attempted packing of the Supreme Court, Watergate, to name just a few. We have also suffered and survived a fair number of poor or disastrous presidents. This is not to underestimate the damage Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could wreak. The choice has never before been clearer. In the end, no matter how unenthusiastic one may be about Hillary Clinton, she is the better choice. Those disappointed and disaffected by the menu offered are still obligated to come to the table and partake of what is available. The only way to keep America ''great,'' whatever that means, is to ensure that we do not elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NICHOLAS W. PUNER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  West Tisbury, Mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I believe that many voters of all ages are asking themselves whether we are looking at the ''twilight of democracy,'' as Mr. Kernis suggests in his thoughtful letter. Just a few short months ago, sitting with thousands of others at a Bernie Sanders rally in New Brunswick, N.J., amid chants of ''this is what democracy looks like,'' I believed we were on the cusp of a better time in our democratic growth and maturation. Perhaps the lesson in both the Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Bernie Sanders campaigns is that democracy remains a work in progress, a precarious and delicate work to be sure, and one that could produce a leader on the foundation of profound hatred and prejudice just as quickly as one who proffers compassion and inclusion. The future of American democracy clings less on the outcome of this election and more on the lessons we learn from the present moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  PETER SCHMIDT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Phillipsburg, N.J.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When historians look back on the decline of democracy in America, I suspect they will identify two contributing factors. One is the shallow and faulty information transmitted in the majority of news media. The second is citizens' lack of knowledge of American political history. Without solid factual information and lacking an education in government and history, voters cannot make sensible decisions and are easily bamboozled by demagogues -- clearly the situation in America today. Democracy cannot function with an ill-informed, ignorant and politically illiterate electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  JOSEPHINE DONOVAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Urbana, Ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> debacle is reminiscent of the rise of totalitarian figures, who woo the disaffected by making them think that someone is taking something away from them that is rightfully theirs and that a show of brute strength in a leader is more important than the truth of what he says. Democracy will survive in America because of the checks and balances of a strong two-party system, but the public face and the heart and soul of our nation, as perceived at home and abroad, could suffer a horrific blow if this ignorant man should reach its highest office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BERNARD LANGS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New Providence, N.J.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many reasons explain the popularity of candidates such as Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but one that stands out is the increasing distrust we feel toward our institutions and toward one another, as well documented in recent surveys. This in turn leads to a lowered sense of community and a weakening of our democracy. The way forward, no matter who wins the election, is to rebuild trust and community feeling. This can best begin on a local level. All of us, leaders and community members alike, have a necessary role to play in creating cohesive, inclusive, sustainable and participatory local community life -- which is the keystone of democratic self-rule, and of democracy itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  BILL BERKOWITZ</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Arlington, Mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The writer, emeritus professor of psychology at University of Massachusetts Lowell, is a founding contributor to the Community Tool Box, a community building website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thinking about what is at stake for America's future is very difficult when a citizen is preoccupied with what is at stake for his or her own future. It is debatable as to whether Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has done a service to the country by ''letting out the dogs,'' but he is forcing us to see who we really are as a nation. Actually, this election is democracy in action; now let's see if it really works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  MICHAEL SCHWARTZ</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dix Hills, N.Y.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Blaming Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the demise of the American democracy and for his own popularity seems incongruous. With our legislature composed mostly of millionaires, elected through a gerrymandered system, funded by a precious few and managed by an established elite, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters -- and Bernie Sanders's -- may represent a desperate last gasp to reaffirm true democracy. That being said, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> scares the hell out of me. But he is a symptom of a failing republic, not the cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ROBERT READ THRUN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Covington, Ky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Democracy requires a well-informed and engaged citizenry to function properly. Unfortunately American voters are updated about politics and current affairs by media outlets increasingly intent on ratings and financial performance. As a result, much of the political discourse on television is little more than partisan entertainment. Ironically, some of our best political pundits are comedians. Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the reality TV star, has taken full advantage of this media circus. Whatever you may think about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, you must admit he has manipulated the media masterfully. He consistently engages in outrageous behavior, which would disqualify other candidates, to obtain vast amounts of free publicity. This is not the twilight of democracy. Rather, it is the dawn of reality-show entertainment politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  JERRY WALLINGFORD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  San Diego</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In ''Why So Many Business Leaders Are Tiptoeing Around </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' (DealBook column, Sept. 20), Andrew Ross Sorkin describes conversations with many chief executives who criticize Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but add, ''I could never say that on the record'' because he could bully them, their families and their companies. Self-silencing because of fear is a hallmark of societies under dictatorships. Yes, our democracy will be endangered if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is elected. Merely contemplating the possibility, some Americans are already less free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  JENNY GOLUB</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New York</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent memory, we survived Watergate and the re-election of George W. Bush. Our institutions are strong, and our faith in them keeps us from tearing up flagstones and throwing bombs rather than waiting for the next election cycle. Much as I abhor the notion, should Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> win, we may rationally hope that in four, or at most eight, years, we will have a new president as different from him as President Obama was from George W. Bush. This dialectic process is messy, but I hope and believe that it will continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A lot of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> support is anarchic, based on the notion that the status quo is so awful that any alternative, no matter how risky, is preferable. Unless pigs fly in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency and he really grows in the job, which I do not read as a good bet, his supporters will soon learn that he has nothing to offer beyond narcissistic pomposity. They will see yesterday's bad become today's awful. There will be a big swing in the other direction toward, possibly, the next Bernie Sanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  HAROLD BROWN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  New York</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yes, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would usher in the twilight of democracy. While most of the media attention has been devoted to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bullying, sleazy business history,and outrageous statements, what he says he will do if elected is even more frightening. He is going to build ''the wall'' and forcibly relocate millions of undocumented residents; reduce Chinese imports, which would likely trigger a trade war; keep Muslims from entering the country; roll back environmental regulations; eliminate Obamacare; and appoint pro-life Supreme Court justices. The list goes on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeal as an agent for change explains much of his support, if his agenda becomes reality, America would fundamentally change in dangerous ways. We have seen radical change before -- in Russia 100 years ago, in Germany in the 1930s and in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the 1940s. We have also seen strongmen. They only get worse when in power. ''The twilight of democracy'' is staring us in the face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  JOE HOWELL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Washington</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Writer Responds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like Mr. Puner and other respondents, I have strong faith in our democracy. Democracy is also ''a work in progress,'' as Mr. Schmidt says, and needs constant attention. But money talks in America, perhaps louder than ever, making it even more difficult to give ordinary Americans a voice. Electing the rich, self-indulgent Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has little regard for rules and regulations that don't suit him, and no regard for people who don't adore him, would be a calamity for our democracy that could take decades to repair. Mr. Puner and others say they are confident that our democracy can withstand the challenge, but the prospect of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency, along with a compliant Congress and a Supreme Court with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appointees, leaves me deeply concerned. Our strong democracy notwithstanding, prudence dictates that we do all we can to keep Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> out of the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This may also be the election that mandates a deeper understanding of the American people. Mr. Berkowitz says that the distrust we feel toward one another and toward our institutions weakens our democracy. I agree that many Americans have ceased to see our nation as one community. That is surely more difficult as America becomes more diverse, ethnically, racially and religiously. But we need to try. I believe that our Constitution points the way. We are all equal under the law. I believe that we can recover our sense of one nation indivisible if our institutions, schools, churches and others recognize their responsibility to help bring us together. </SPAN></P>
