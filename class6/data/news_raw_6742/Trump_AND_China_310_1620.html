<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HANOI, Vietnam -- Officially, the top world leaders who gather Thursday at the Group of 7 summit meeting will talk about shared concerns, like global trade or the Islamic State. But their private discussions are likely to cover a topic that is not on the agenda: Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Obama now hears questions in his meetings with world leaders about whether Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has a realistic shot at becoming president. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For months, Mr. Obama has answered those questions with an emphatic ''no.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I continue to believe Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will not be president,'' Mr. Obama said in February at the end of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit meeting in California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But this week's summit meeting in Japan is the first among major allies since Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> moved decisively toward securing the Republican nomination, and Mr. Obama's counterparts are likely to want more detail in his explanations of an election that has prompted fascination and apprehension overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama's Japanese hosts are particularly alarmed at the prospect of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency because the real estate developer has been bashing Japan for decades. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> criticisms have a distinctly 1980s flavor, when Japanese cars were flooding American markets and Japanese businesses were buying premier American properties like Rockefeller Center in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You have to see the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States -- it's unbelievable,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in a recent interview. ''They sell to us, and we practically give them back nothing by comparison.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added, ''It's a very unfair situation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has criticized the military alliance between Japan and the United States as being one-sided, and he suggested in a March interview that Japan and South Korea should have their own nuclear arsenals so they would be less reliant on the security umbrella provided by the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hosting an April summit meeting intended to limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons, Mr. Obama lashed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The person who made the statements doesn't know much about foreign policy, nuclear policy or the Korean Peninsula, or the world generally,'' he said, not mentioning Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by name. But he acknowledged that foreign leaders had questioned him about the presumptive Republican nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It came up on the sidelines, I've said before, that people pay attention to American elections,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Even in those countries that are used to a carnival atmosphere in their own politics want sobriety and clarity when it comes to U.S. elections.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More recently, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggested that he would be willing to hold direct negotiations with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, in yet another challenge to a core Japanese security priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March comments led to an almost immediate response from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. ''Whoever will become the next president of the United States, the Japan-U.S. alliance is the cornerstone of Japan's diplomacy,'' Mr. Abe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other Japanese officials have been even more forceful. The first week in May is generally regarded as a holiday in Japan, and top Japanese officials flood Washington for meetings. This year, many of those meetings focused on anxieties over Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At one such meeting, Kenichiro Sasae, Japan's ambassador to the United States, joked that he was looking forward to hearing experts ''explain how Emperor Qin Shi Huang built the Great Wall of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and made the Mexicans pay for it,'' a reference to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promise to build a wall at the Mexican border at Mexico's expense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a more serious vein, Mr. Sasae said he was disappointed by the isolationism expressed by some presidential candidates, another clear reference to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I don't want to see that kind of United States,'' Mr. Sasae said. ''I know that you know there has to be a debate about how to make the United States this strong, but the question is not whether you can be strong without a proper role in the rest of the world.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At another recent meeting, Itsunori Onodera, a former defense minister and a member of the Japanese House of Representatives, gave a lengthy list of what he characterized as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> misstatements. ''I don't think there are any </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters present here,'' he joked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Onodera emphasized the ways that Japan supported Washington's priorities in the region and helped pay American expenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Nothing is more important than the stability of East Asia,'' he said. ''We don't want the U.S. political leaders to send out the wrong message.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even so, some Japanese officials have been concerned that the Obama administration is too solicitous of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Tokyo's great Asian rival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Whatever concerns there were about the Obama administration sometimes tilting toward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, those have been overwhelmed with what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is saying about Japan and our alliances,'' said Michael J. Green, who served as a senior adviser on Asia during the George W. Bush administration. ''They're really worried.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In private conversations, Japanese officials have said their only solace is that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is even more critical of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> than he is of Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> loses, his ascent has led world leaders to worry that his ''America first'' platform is a harbinger of pressure for allies to pay up or make trade concessions in return for military protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama has himself insisted that allies share more of the burdens of military efforts in places like Libya and Syria, and has openly complained that even some European allies are ''free riders.'' But Mr. Obama still accepts that the United States is an indispensable nation without whose leadership global problems fester and intensify. Administration officials do say that sometimes the United States must act solely for the security of other nations, a message they hope will reassure the Japanese.</SPAN></P>
