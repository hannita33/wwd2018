<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- General Motors's main joint venture in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was fined $29 million on Friday on charges that it suppressed competition by enforcing minimum sales prices for dealers. It is the latest in a string of penalties against non-Chinese auto brands under the country's antimonopoly law.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese regulators have punished companies in several industries, likemilk and medical devices, under the 2008 law in what appears to be an effort to force down consumer prices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  G.M. had announced in August 2014 that Shanghai G.M., its joint venture with the state-owned Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, was under investigation by antimonopoly regulators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Shanghai Price Bureau said that Shanghai G.M. improperly hurt competition by enforcing minimum prices dealers were allowed to charge for Cadillac, Chevrolet and Buick models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That ''disrupted the normal order of market competition,'' said a statement by the price bureau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Setting minimum retail prices is a common practice in many markets, but lawyers say Chinese regulators appear to regard it as an improper restraint on competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The price bureau's statement said the penalty was set at 4 percent of Shanghai G.M.'s annual sales, or 201 million yuan, about $29 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  G.M. vies with Volkswagen for the status of the top-selling vehicle brand in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sales of G.M. vehicles in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are up 8.5 percent so far this year, to 3.4 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''G.M. fully respects local laws and regulations wherever we operate,'' the company said in a statement. ''We will provide full support to our joint venture in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to ensure that all responsive and appropriate actions are taken with respect to this matter.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has criticized Chinese trade practices, but there was no indication the case was linked to that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Audi, Volkswagen's luxury unit, was fined $40.5 million, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Chrysler brand received a smaller penalty in 2014 on similar charges of enforcing minimum sales prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  State media cited an official saying Daimler Benz's Mercedes unit was guilty of violations, but no penalty was announced. Toyota Motor Corporation said its Lexus unit was under scrutiny, but no results have been announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The industrywide investigation began in 2014 after complaints of foreign auto brands abusing their control over supplies of spare parts to overcharge consumers. In the case of Mercedes, regulators said purchasing the spare parts needed to assemble one car would cost as much as 12 new vehicles.</SPAN></P>
