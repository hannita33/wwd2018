</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HERESY ON WALL STREET  |  Laurence D. Fink, co-founder and chief executive of BlackRock, sent a letter to 500 chief executives on Monday urging them to stop providing quarterly earnings estimates,<BR>Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. The proposal, an effort to curb companies' short-term focus, goes against the grain of most money managers, who clamor for companies to provide detailed guidance on the next quarter, down to the last penny. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To be clear, we do believe companies should still report quarterly results - long-termism should not be a substitute for transparency,&quot; he said. &quot;But C.E.O.s should be more focused in these reports on demonstrating progress against their strategic plans than a one-penny deviation from their E.P.S. targets or analyst consensus estimates.&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter goes further than the proposals Mr. Fink had already made to encourage longer-term thinking over the last few years. Mr. Fink is asking chief executives and boards to provide detailed long-term plans for their shareholders too. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Short-term investors were able to offer more compelling strategies than the companies themselves when management did not map out their plans for the next few years, he argued. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call from Mr. Fink comes as activist investors are increasingly pressuring companies to return money to shareholders or buy back shares, but big investors and business leaders are also trying to encourage less focus on short-term efforts to life earnings. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world's largest asset managers have held secret meetings to discuss proposals to encourage longer-term investment, The Financial Times reports. The meetings were said to have been convened by Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, and Warren Buffett, to work on a statement of best practice. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, Mr. Fink said he wrote the letter to get ahead of proxy season, when many companies hold their annual meetings and vote on shareholder resolutions. He is hoping to influence how chief executives discuss their companies' performance and goals in their annual letters to shareholders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ALPHABET CLOSES IN ON APPLE  |  Wall Street got its first glimpse of the financial details of Alphabet, Google's parent company, and investors liked what they saw enough that it is poised to become the world's most valuable company, </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conor Dougherty reports in The New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alphabet's advertising business helped the company outpace expectations with its earnings in the last three months of 2015. This is in spite of spending $3.6 billion a year on projects like self-driving cars that do not make much money. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The earnings bolstered Alphabet's share price, and when Wall Street opens for business on Tuesday, Alphabet will most likely be worth more than Apple. It seems that investors will allow big tech companies to spend on side projects as long as the core business is not showing signs of weakness. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alphabet's total revenue, barring currency fluctuations, rose 24 percent to $21.3 billion, compared with the last three months of 2014. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase was attributed to growth in mobile search and YouTube - giving investors a sign that the business was making a smooth transition from desktop computers to mobile phones. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google was notorious for its indifference to Wall Street, but Alphabet has reined in expenses, repurchased stock and given investors more insight into how Google's core business is performing. Many Alphabet investors are hoping that the disclosure of new information will give the stock price an extra lift, as it did with Amazon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HOW FREE ELECTRICITY HELPED DIG $9 BILLION HOLE IN PUERTO RICO  |  Puerto Rico's power authority, also known as Prepa, has been giving free power to all 78 of Puerto Rico's municipalities, to many of its government-owned enterprises and even some for-profit business, but not to its citizens,<BR>Mary Williams Walsh writes in DealBook.<BR>It has done this for decades, even as it has sunk deeper into debt and borrowed billions just to stay afloat. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the island's government is running out of cash and a movement is underway to limit the free electricity, which is estimated to cost Prepa hundreds of millions of dollars. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the free power is so tightly woven into the fabric of society that unwinding it could worsen the plight of the people who live in Puerto Rico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the towns don't get free energy, they're going to have to pay for it by increasing their property taxes or something, so the people will end up paying,&quot; said Eduardo Bhatia, the president of the Puerto Rico Senate. Residents are already upset about a recent sales tax hike. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bhatia will begin hearings on Tuesday to determine who and what are to blame for the authority's larger problems, especially its inefficient power plants. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the power provider continues to demonstrate how complex solutions to the debt problems are likely to be. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Aguadilla, a town on Puerto Rico's northwest coast, Prepa managed to power a development spree, populating the town with restaurants, a hotel, a water park, a baseball stadium and a waterfront studded with dancing fountains. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carlos M&eacute;ndez Mart&iacute;nez, the mayor of the town, has kept his 17-year-old promise not to raise taxes, but even he is anticipating limits on his free power now that the authority is struggling for solvency and recently put a solar power system on the roof of the town's ice skating rink that he hopes will eventually get it off the grid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ON THE AGENDA  |  Monday's newsletter included an incorrect time for Yahoo's conference call on its fourth-quarter and full-year results. It starts today at 5 p.m. Pfizer will hold a conference call on its latest quarterly results at 10 a.m. ExxonMobil's call on its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings starts at 10:30 a.m. The Securities and Exchange Commission's   Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee will meet at 9:30 a.m. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TED CRUZ WINS REPUBLICAN CAUCUSES IN IOWA  |  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas dealt a humbling loss to Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Iowa caucuses,<BR>Jonathan Martin reports in The New York Times. With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Cruz had nearly 28 percent of the vote, while Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had 24. Mr. Cruz's victory throws into question the depth of support for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> unconventional candidacy. Marco Rubio finished a strong third with 23 percent, bolstering his case to consolidate the support of Republicans uneasy about the two top finishers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders remained locked in a tight race, Patrick Healy reports in The New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The close results were unnerving Mrs. Clinton and her team, who had expressed confidence that they had recaptured political momentum in recent days. They are likely to split Iowa's share of delegates to the Democratic convention, and Mr. Sanders will be able to argue that the result was a virtual tie. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Iowa Democratic Party declared early Tuesday morning that Mrs. Clinton had won, but The Associated Press had not called the race yet.</SPAN></P>
