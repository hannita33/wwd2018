<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON --  Of all the voters who might be expected to resist the charms of Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the two million members of the Service Employees International Union would most likely be near the top of the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union, which endorsed Hillary Clinton in November, is widely regarded as one of the more progressive in the labor movement. It skews female and racially diverse -- roughly the opposite of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally, in other words. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the union's president, Mary Kay Henry, acknowledged that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> holds appeal even for some of her members. ''There is deep economic anxiety among our members and the people we're trying to organize that I believe Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> message is tapping into,'' Ms. Henry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In expressing her concern, Ms. Henry reflected a different form of anxiety that is weighing on some union leaders and Democratic operatives: their fear that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, if not effectively countered, may draw an unusually large number of union voters in a possible general election matchup. This could, in turn, bolster Republicans in swing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, all of which President Obama won twice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The source of the attraction to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, say union members and leaders, is manifold: the candidate's unapologetically populist positions on certain economic issues, particularly trade; a frustration with the impotence of conventional politicians; and above all, a sense that he rejects the norms of Washington discourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They feel he's the one guy who's saying what's on people's minds,'' Thomas Hanify, the president of the Indiana state firefighters union, said of his rank and file.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Hanify said that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has so far dominated the ''firehouse chatter'' in his state. While he allowed that his members tilt Republican, he estimated that most followed the lead of the union's international leadership and supported Mr. Obama in 2008 and 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Henry and other labor leaders remain confident that they can keep their members in the fold by making a case that the Republicans' economic agenda, including Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, runs counter to the interests of working people. But they also see Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as posing particular risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Anyone who talks about dividing people in the country as a solution is a threat to the country, to democracy, the economy, and to working people, and we take every one of those seriously,'' said Richard L. Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The potential pairing of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and union members could be helped along by a sense that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, unlike more conventional Republicans, has historically enjoyed a cordial relationship with labor on many of his real estate projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He has put his fair share into hiring union people,'' said Richard Sabato, the president of a building and construction trades council in northern New Jersey. ''He's done that in Manhattan, in New Jersey.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But that is not always the case. The owners of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Hotel Las Vegas filed objections to a recent vote by roughly 500 of its workers to unionize, and the National Labor Relations Board has found merit to the claims that the hotel violated workers' labor rights. (The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign did not respond to requests for comment.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sabato said that his members, who lean Republican but in many cases voted for Mr. Obama, would ''march behind'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the issue of illegal immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even more important for many union members has been the issue of economic globalization. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has railed against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-country trade deal the administration finished negotiating last year. And he has bemoaned the administration's failure to stand up to what he and many union members see as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mercantilist policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has also fulminated against plans by the company that owns Nabisco to shift some production to Mexico -- ''I love Oreos,'' he said, ''I will never eat them again'' -- and vowed to impose a punishing tariff on imports of Ford cars unless the company canceled a $2.5 billion investment in plants in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We like that he does not support TPP, that he has taken the position that there should be trade tariffs for a company that moves jobs overseas,'' said Ryan Leenders, 30, a member of the International Association of Machinists in Washington State. Mr. Leenders, who estimated that one-quarter to one-third of his factory's union workers were </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters, said he voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and wrote in Ron Paul in 2012.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Reflecting the anti-establishment mood that has engulfed parts of the labor movement, Mr. Leenders said he believed that more than half of his union's workers support Senator Bernie Sanders, while very few support Mrs. Clinton, despite the fact that the machinists union endorsed her last summer. (A machinists spokesman said that, ''At this point, any estimates of support for a candidate are more a passing snapshot of popularity.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many union officials are grappling with a similar dynamic, including the Teamsters, whose members have a ''Teamsters for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' Facebook page, with more than 650 likes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  John Bulgaro, the president of Teamsters Local 294 in Albany, said that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had generated excitement among his members, but that ''a lot of people like Bernie Sanders.'' He cautioned that they would need to hear more about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> position on labor rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To be sure, polling of union voters shows that Mrs. Clinton remains broadly popular and would carry most Sanders supporters in a matchup against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But the same polling suggests that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could perform unusually well among these voters for a Republican nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Christopher M. Shelton, the president of the Communications Workers of America, which endorsed Mr. Sanders in December, said that while polling of his members showed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> support lagging far behind support for Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton, it was higher than Republican presidential candidates typically net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeal, particularly among white working-class men, longtime labor officials and political operatives point out that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> popularity before a single primary vote has been cast is a vastly different proposition than whether he would be able to retain that support in the fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In every election around this time there are stories suggesting that union members will defect -- 'Oh, white union men won't vote for Obama,''' Steve Rosenthal, a former political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and progressive political organizer, wrote in an email response to questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the end, Mr. Rosenthal said, union voters almost always end up voting overwhelmingly Democratic in presidential elections. White male union members favored Mr. Obama in 2008, and John Kerry in 2004, by roughly 20 percentage points, according to polling commissioned by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., even as white men over all favored the Republican candidate by a large margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rosenthal said that unions have proved adept at building support among their members for Democratic nominees who generally embrace their economic agenda and at undermining support for Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a recent study of working-class voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania based on over 1,500 interviews, Working America, a labor-affiliated group, found genuine support for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> among Democrats. But Matt Morrison, the group's deputy director, said that many </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters were receptive to information that suggested a gap between the candidate's words and deeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Just delivering a little bit of new information, we could see that his brand takes a hit,'' Mr. Morrison said, referring to reports that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may have used undocumented workers on some of his development projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other experts cautioned that even if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were to retain substantial support among white male union members without college degrees, that would not necessarily yield him an electoral advantage in November if he became the Republican nominee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The voters whom labor unions must typically work the hardest to turn out, like younger voters and Latinos, ''are groups that will be highly motivated'' against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said Guy Molyneux, a pollster who has surveyed union voters extensively over the years. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Molyneux also said that many of the union voters attracted by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were among the 30 percent of union voters who already vote reliably Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, unlike most other Republicans, whose appeal to union voters rarely extends beyond cultural issues like gun rights, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic pronouncements have a greater potential to scramble the standard political calculus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I do think that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a threat,'' said Mike Lux, a progressive activist who is a former labor official and veteran of President Bill Clinton's administration. ''If the Democratic nominee is Hillary, and she's mushy at all on the trade issue, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will take that issue and drive it and drive it and drive it.''</SPAN></P>
