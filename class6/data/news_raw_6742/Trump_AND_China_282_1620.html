<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton dominated a final series of debate exchanges with Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> about national security and gender, telling voters they could not trust her opponent with nuclear weapons and warning that he does not respect women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are a few of the highlights. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; Asked about a remark he made that Mrs. Clinton lacked a presidential ''look,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repeated the claim, adding that ''she doesn't have the stamina.'' In response, Mrs. Clinton ticked off some highlights of her tenure as secretary of state, saying Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''can talk to me about stamina'' when he accomplishes as much. ''He tried to change from looks to stamina, but this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,'' Mrs. Clinton said. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> defended himself before adding that he had planned to say ''something extremely rough'' to Mrs. Clinton and her family, but decided against it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; Mrs. Clinton pressed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repeated claim, contradicted by public statements he has made in the past, that he had opposed the Iraq war from the beginning. ''Donald supported the invasion of Iraq,'' she said. ''That is absolutely proved over and over again.'' ''Wrong,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interjected. ''Wrong.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> insisted again that he had opposed the Iraq war, calling any suggestion otherwise ''a mainstream media nonsense.'' Lester Holt, the moderator, said, ''The record shows otherwise.'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> went on to appraise his own temperament, calling it ''my strongest asset, maybe by far,'' before attacking Mrs. Clinton's. She smiled. ''Woo! O.K.,'' she said, beginning her response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; Mrs. Clinton hit Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for his record of praise for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, lamenting that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had ''publicly invited Putin to hack into'' American communications, as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shook his head. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he did not think ''anybody knows'' if Russia was behind the recent hacks of Democratic organizations, wondering aloud if it might instead be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or a single hacker who ''weighs 400 pounds'' and sits at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; After Mrs. Clinton suggested she was worried about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> getting his hands on the nuclear codes, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> replied, ''That line is getting a little bit old.'' Mrs. Clinton mocked Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''secret plan,'' as she called it, to fight the Islamic State, saying he had no true strategy. She also sought to reassure American allies that the country would honor its international commitments, saying some of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments during the campaign had startled them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; Asked about his propagation of the conspiracy theory raising doubts about Mr. Obama's birth, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tried to blame Mrs. Clinton, suggesting falsely that she, too, had questioned the president's birthplace. ''She failed to get the birth certificate,'' he said. ''When I got involved, I didn't fail.'' Mrs. Clinton said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had ''really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen,'' calling his efforts ''very hurtful.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; Pressed on his refusal to release his tax returns, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repeated an oft-used line that he is facing ''a routine audit'' that precluded him from releasing the information. Mr. Holt noted that the I.R.S. had said he was free to release anything he wanted. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he would ''release my tax returns, against my lawyers' wishes,'' if Mrs. Clinton agreed to release a cache of her emails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; Asked if she believed police officers were ''implicitly biased'' against African-Americans, Mrs. Clinton suggested that all Americans were susceptible to bias. ''I think unfortunately too many of us in this great country jump to conclusions about each other,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; Asked about race relations, Mrs. Clinton said that race remained ''a significant challenge'' in the country, adding that the criminal justice system treated minorities differently. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Mrs. Clinton ''doesn't want to use a couple of words'' -- law and order -- before defending the contentious stop-and-frisk police strategy. ''African-Americans and Hispanics are living in hell,'' he said. ''You walk down the streets, you get shot.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; After Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> defended his plans to lower taxes on the wealthy, mixing in jabs at Mrs. Clinton, she joked, ''I have a feeling that by the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> replied, ''Why not?'' Mr. Holt reminded Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that he was speaking during Mrs. Clinton's allotted time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> boasted about his campaign travels. ''You've seen me, I've been all over the place,'' he said. ''You decided to stay home and that's okay.'' Mrs. Clinton replied that she did indeed prepare for the debate, adding that she was preparing to be president, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; Hitting Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over his tax returns, Mrs. Clinton wondered if there was ''something he's hiding,'' before addressing her own use of a private email as secretary of state. ''I made a mistake using a private email,'' she said. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cut in, ''That's for sure.'' Mrs. Clinton added, ''I'm not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; Mrs. Clinton condemned Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for refusing to pay contractors on several projects, saying she was grateful her father had never done business with him. She said the debate crowd included an architect whom Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had not paid. ''Maybe he didn't do a good job,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; Mrs. Clinton, seeking to portray Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as an enemy of working people, said he had ''rooted for the housing crisis'' because of the financial opportunities it might afford him. ''That's called business, by the way,'' he interjected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- criticizing trade deals approved by Bill Clinton, among others -- suggested Mrs. Clinton had failed to improve people's lives during her decades in public life. As Mrs. Clinton defended her record, he interrupted frequently. ''You haven't done it. You haven't done it,'' he said. ''Excuse me.'' Mrs. Clinton shot back, ''Donald, I know you live in your own reality,'' before continuing her answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; Mrs. Clinton, looking toward Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said it was ''good to be with'' him on the same stage at last. ''You have to judge us,'' she said, in a response to a question about job creation. ''Who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency?'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> replied that ''our jobs are fleeing the country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fiscal plans as ''trumped-up trickle-down economics,'' before saying he had received millions of dollars of support from his father. ''My father gave me a very small loan,'' he replied, before appearing to hesitate while addressing Mrs. Clinton. ''Secretary Clinton? Is that O.K.?'' he said of her title. ''Good.''</SPAN></P>
