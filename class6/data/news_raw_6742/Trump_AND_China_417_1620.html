<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The executives meeting with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Manhattan on Wednesday include Elon Musk of Tesla, Timothy D. Cook of Apple and Jeff Bezos of Amazon.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAN FRANCISCO - At the top of the agenda when President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">meets with tech leaders on Wednesday afternoon: jobs, jobs and more jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other topics will come up too, depending on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> whims. One likely possibility: the repatriation of offshore cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top tech companies collectively hold hundreds of billions of dollars overseas. They would like to return the money to the United States at a beneficial tax rate. For Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a deal on these funds could represent money that would help advance an infrastructure program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But mostly, it will be about jobs. The tech community has put its products in every home and pocket, generating enormous wealth along the way. But the companies employ relatively few people, and the wealth is concentrated in places like Silicon Valley and Seattle. Changing this equation is the task of Peter Thiel, the tech investor who is now advising Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting agenda, which was still a work in progress, was described by a person briefed on the round table, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about it publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those attending the meeting, which will be held at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in Manhattan, include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Elon Musk of Tesla <BR>&quot; Larry Page and Eric E. Schmidt of Alphabet, Google's parent <BR>&quot; Timothy D. Cook of Apple<BR>&quot; Satya Nadella of Microsoft<BR>&quot; Jeff Bezos of Amazon<BR>&quot; Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook<BR>&quot; Safra A. Catz of Oracle<BR>&quot; Brian M. Krzanich of Intel<BR>&quot; Chuck Robbins of Cisco<BR>&quot; Ginni Rometty of IBM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The companies are generally keeping a low profile about the event. Several of them were Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> targets during the campaign over issues as varied as offshoring, digital security and antitrust issues. They also saw how a post-Election Day meeting with television executives, while supposedly off the record,turned into public humiliation after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attacked them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Technology Industry Council, a trade association for the tech industry, held a conference call last Friday with some of its members - which include Apple, Amazon and Facebook - to formulate a unified approach. Dean C. Garfield, president of the council, was guarded about the meeting's prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are many areas of potential shared alignment between the technology industry and the incoming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration,&quot; Mr. Garfield said. &quot;Wednesday's meeting is a good opportunity to explore what is possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Rometty, a member of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strategic and Policy Forum, is championing a new educational model for the United States that focuses on vocational training. Six-year public high schools that &quot;combine traditional education with the best of community colleges&quot; would provide IBM and other companies with the relevant skills for &quot;new collar&quot; information-technology jobs, she wrote in a letter to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no simple policy change that could spread tech's success to parts of the country that are reeling. Facebook employs relatively few people. Apple manufactures its products mostly in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and says reproducing its intricate ecosystem here would push up prices drastically for iPhones. Amazon has created tens of thousands of jobs in its warehouses across the country but is also blamed by critics for forcing small retailers out of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two companies were invited to the meeting on Wednesday but are not showing up: the ride-hailing company Uber and the short-term home rental service Airbnb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps it is merely coincidence, but both companies are at the forefront of the debate about jobs and the digital economy. Fans say they provide flexible work for those who need to supplement their incomes. Critics say they are poor substitutes for full-time jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airbnb said that its chief executive, Brian Chesky, was traveling overseas, and that nothing more should be read into his absence. &quot;We look forward to working with the incoming administration, and others in Washington, on a range of issues,&quot; said Nick Papas, a company spokesman. He declined to say where Mr. Chesky was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Uber spokesman said its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, was in India this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple has already drawn the president-elect's scrutiny over jobs. &quot;One of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States,&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in late November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, in what perhaps could be seen as a pre-emptive strike, Apple was revealed to be negotiating a major investment in a technology fund celebrated by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last week for its jobs-making potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple has held discussions about potentially participating in a $100 billion fund to be run by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, according to a person briefed on the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SoftBank's founder, Masayoshi Son, pledged last weekto the president-elect that his company would invest $50 billion in the United States and create some 50,000 jobs. After Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweeted that news, some pointed out that the fund had been created before the election and that much of the investment would probably have been in this country no matter what.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apple's discussions with SoftBank, which was the first Japanese telecommunications company to sell the iPhone in Japan, are not close to completion, the person briefed on the talks cautioned. And the discussions began well before Mr. Son's meeting with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The talks were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. Apple declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silicon Valley was largely opposed to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a candidate - sometimes vocally, sometimes quietly. In the wake of his election, there is a shift in attitudes. Perhaps it is simple pragmatism, but more conciliatory voices are being heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post - a frequent scourge of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> during the election - tweeted his congratulations. &quot;I for one give him my most open mind,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Catz, the co-chief executive of Oracle, was even more enthusiastic. &quot;I plan to tell the president-elect that we are with him and are here to help in any way we can,&quot; she said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on Tuesday, one big tech name met Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ahead of the rest. Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and now primarily a philanthropist, was at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in the early afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a good time,&quot; Mr. Gates said. &quot;We had a good conversation about innovation, how it can help in health, education, the impact of foreign aid and energy, and a wide-ranging conversation about power of innovation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
