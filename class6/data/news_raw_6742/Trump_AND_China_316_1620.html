<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the first presidential debate in the books, both candidates returned to the campaign trail on Tuesday and intensified their criticism of each other from afar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a rally in Melbourne, Fla., on Tuesday evening, a confident and loud Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strode on stage and rifled off his greatest hits from the debate the night before, acclaiming his critiques of Hillary Clinton and routinely pointing to her extended tenure in government as a detriment. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And, this being Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he bragged about the ratings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That was an exciting evening for me folks,'' he said, adding, ''And it set the all time record for debates and maybe television, who knows.'' (Nearly 84 million tuned in, the most ever for a debate, but not quite Super Bowl.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He spoke before a packed crowd at an airplane hangar, lined rail to rail, each face shown bright by extra houselights hung by the campaign for the filming of an apparent advertisement. The candidate mixed in highlights from the debate with his standard stump speech, as his campaign plane sat just to his right, occasionally illuminated by the lightning strikes in the distance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At one point, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> looked to his red, white and blue plane to illustrate a common point from the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''See that plane, see that plane? That plane was built in America,'' he said. ''Now that same company is going to start building these planes in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repeats personal attacks against a former Miss Universe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, tried to refine some of his answers from Monday's debate in an interview on Fox News. However, he may have made matters worse for himself when he continued to disparage a Miss Universe pageant winner, Alicia Machado, for gaining weight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She was the winner and she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem,'' said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who was the pageant's executive producer at the time. ''Not only that -- her attitude. And we had a real problem with her.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Already struggling to appeal to suburban women, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may have dug a deeper hole by doubling down on the remark. The Clinton campaign was eager to seize upon it as fresh evidence that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is sexist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton appeared to be emboldened by her debate performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many commentators on both sides of the political spectrum deemed Mrs. Clinton's effort a success because of her preparedness and quick wit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked in a gaggle on her campaign plane what she thought about speculation that her opponent might not appear in the next two debates, Mrs. Clinton told reporters that she would be happy to have the stage to herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite highlighting online polls that declared him the winner, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that the debate moderator, Lester Holt, was overly tough on him and blamed technical difficulties at his podium for the appearance that he had the sniffles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> theory that he was given a faulty microphone at the debate, Mrs. Clinton quipped, ''Anyone who complains about the microphone is not having a good night.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here's what we know about Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fact-checkers continued to analyze statements made during the debate, and one in particular by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is likely to provide fodder for more questioning during the homestretch of the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not push back against Mrs. Clinton's assertion that he paid no federal income taxes, arguing that paying as little as possible to the government is the ''smart'' thing to do. While Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> maintains that he will not release his tax returns as long as he is still being audited, The New York Times took a look at what we know about them so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Time may be running short for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to make his return public before the election, but during the debate, he said there was still a chance he would ignore the advice of his lawyers and release them. The condition, of course, would be the publication of Mrs. Clinton's missing emails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Where does the Republican ticket stand on climate change? At the moment, they are all over the map.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To recap: Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has written on Twitter on multiple occasions that global warming was a ''hoax'' perpetuated by the Chinese. On Monday night, he asserted that he never said that. But he did not say if he now thinks humans are responsible for climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> running mate, told CNN on Tuesday that he thought there was ''no question'' that human activity affected climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Asked on the same network to clarify Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> position, Kellyanne Conway, his campaign manager, lamented that his Twitter posts were getting so much scrutiny and said that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> thought that global warming was ''naturally occurring'' and not man-made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did score one victory on Tuesday: the endorsement of another ''Never </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' Republican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  John Sununu, a former governor of New Hampshire, threw his support behind the Republican nominee and urged others to do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the only candidate in this race who can bring bold change to Washington D.C.,'' he said in a statement emailed by the campaign. ''I support the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Pence ticket for their pro-growth agenda and commitment to protecting American interests.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The endorsement represented a significant change of heart for Mr. Sununu, who was chief of staff for former president George Bush. This year, he described Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in less than flattering terms, calling him someone who has been ''a loser all his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dredging up the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> avoided leveling personal attacks at Mrs. Clinton or her husband, Bill Clinton, over their history of marital problems during the debate, but he made clear that he was thinking about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In postdebate interviews, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that he refrained from dredging up the past out of respect for Chelsea Clinton, Mrs. Clinton's daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Rudolph W. Giuliani, a close ally of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, suggested that such attacks should be fair game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The president of the United States, her husband, disgraced this country with what he did in the Oval Office, and she didn't just stand by him, she attacked Monica Lewinsky,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''And after being married to Bill Clinton for 20 years, if you didn't know the moment Monica Lewinsky said that Bill Clinton violated her that she was telling the truth, then you're too stupid to be president.''</SPAN></P>
