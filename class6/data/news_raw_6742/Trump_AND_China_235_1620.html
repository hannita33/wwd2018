<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general election effort to take down Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> through television ads will begin on Wednesday, with the main ''super PAC'' supporting Hillary Clinton airing its first two attack ads on broadcast television in four swing states. The effort kicks off a multimillion-dollar campaign that will flood screens in those states in the months to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The super PAC, Priorities USA Action, had initially planned to wait until after the June 7 primary contests to introduce TV ads attacking Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the presumptive Republican nominee, but accelerated its effort against him. The group's $6 million investment includes two ads that offer scathing critiques of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments about women that will run for the next three weeks in Ohio, Florida, Virginia and Nevada. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton's most devoted donors have given roughly $80 million to Priorities USA Action to stop Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, more than the group raised in the entire 2012 election to re-elect President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The ads are the beginning of the broader Democratic campaign against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, focused on convincing suburban and working-class women that he does not respect them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Priorities USA Action said it also planned to run ads that critiqued Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business record and portrayed him as out of touch with the working-class Americans he says he represents, an approach similar to the one it used to depict the Republican nominee in 2012, Mitt Romney, as a cold corporate titan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton's allies said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mocking of a New York Times reporter's disability also effectively turned off swing voters, potentially providing fodder for future ads that depict Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as insensitive and unprepared for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Republican rivals criticized Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> similarly on his comments about women and on his business record during the party's nominating contest, but the effort came too late to stop his momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One of the super PAC's ads, called ''Speak,'' shows voters lip-syncing some of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> caustic remarks about women as they wear shirts with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> visage screen-printed on them. The other, ''Respect,'' shows quick interviews with the candidate in which he outlines his positions on abortion and Planned Parenthood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  [Video: Respect Watch on YouTube.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The super PAC had initially invested $130 million to reserve time for broadcast and digital ads that would start running the day after the California and New Jersey primaries in June. But it decided to add an additional buy to accelerate the time line, aiming to sow early doubts about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, particularly among female voters who will have a disproportionate effect on the fall election and with whom Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has shown a particular weakness in polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Female voters favored Mrs. Clinton over Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 55 percent to 35 percent, in a New York Times/CBS News poll released in March, twice the gender gap of the 2012 presidential election, when President Obama defeated Mr. Romney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton's campaign, which cannot directly coordinate with the super PAC, has tried to raise money by showing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments assailing the former secretary of state for playing the ''woman's card.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton, though, has tried to avoid directly provoking Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, relying instead on outside groups like the super PAC to carry out direct attacks. The campaign's online videos against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> have focused mostly on his policy positions and on criticism by his rivals in the Republican primaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Tuesday, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said the ''Speak'' ad had misrepresented one of his statements. ''The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. 'You can tell them to go BLANK themselves' -- was about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, NOT WOMEN!'' he wrote on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That drew a rebuke from the super PAC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Sorry Donald, but the ad isn't only about your overt sexism, it's about your divisiveness and character being unsuitable for the office of the presidency,'' Justin Barasky, a spokesman for the group, said in an email on Tuesday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview, Mr. Barasky said the group thought it had to advertise earlier after seeing the Republican ''stop </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' effort fall short. ''The decision was made recently to go up now because we learned from Washington Republicans that you can't wait to go after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' Mr. Barasky said. ''What they did was too little, too late, and we weren't going to make the same mistake.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new ads adhere to similar lines of attack taken by Our Principles PAC, the super PAC led by Republican operatives. It released an ad, ''Quotes,'' featuring female actors reciting Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> quotations about women. The ad tested highly in effectiveness, but came out only days before the Republican primary in Florida, which Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Speak'' is slightly different in that the ad uses Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> voice rather than those of actors, along with the voices of voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Our research shows most people know very little about Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Priorities PAC, said on MSNBC on Monday night, adding, ''When we tested a lot of the 'Never </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ads, we realized very quickly they really had no idea what Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been saying on the stump and what his record had been in business or toward women, and so it's our job to make sure they see it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added that the group would also be focused on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business record, an issue that numerous Republican groups and campaigns highlighted during the nominating contest. Mr. Cecil specifically mentioned Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> record of ''making ties in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and hiring people in Bangladesh.''</SPAN></P>
