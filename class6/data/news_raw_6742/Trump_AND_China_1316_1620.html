</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Here's what you need to know to start your day.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning. We're off on Monday. Your Morning Briefing will resume publishing on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know today:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Berlin suspect is dead.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anis Amri, the Tunisian wanted in the terrorist attack on a Christmas market this week, was killed by the police in a shootout outside Milan early this morning, the Italian interior minister said at a news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Amri was asked to show identification papers during a routine stop and immediately opened fire at police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, Australia says it averted a terrorist plot in Melbourne - possibly on Christmas Day - with the arrest of five people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Libyan plane hijacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All 109 passengers and crew members are now safe after their plane bound for the capital, Tripoli, was forced to land in Malta today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two hijackers who had threatened to detonate an explosive device were taken into custody, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on national defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declaration on Twitter that the U.S. should greatly &quot;expand its nuclear capability&quot; is likely to remain a major topic of discussion today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> words are at odds with decades of bipartisan efforts to reduce the role of such weapons in the military, and they can be interpreted in several ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His transition team has also begun discussions with border officials on where a wall separating theU.S.from Mexico - one of his signature campaign promises - could be built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gangster life: boring and terrifying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our reporters spent weeks with gang members in Chicago to understand what being in one means. Once well-organized operations built around drug dealing, they're now little more than dangerous cliques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we are making money, I can ignore the urge to retaliate. But if we're sitting here bored, getting high and we got guns around, it ain't nothing else to do,&quot; one member said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turning point in Syria's war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bashar al-Assad's forces now control Aleppo for the first time since 2012. While the victory will bolster the morale of his troops, his next steps are unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Assad is widely seen as lacking the military ability to both keep government-held ground and take back territories held by rebels and the Islamic State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A growing epidemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For me, the sadness of his death was surpassed only by the sadness of his solitude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a doctor referring to the social isolation of a former patient during his final days. About one-third of Americans older than 65 now live alone, and half of those over 85 do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deutsche Bank announced a tentative $7.2 billion settlement to resolve a U.S. federal investigation into the sale of toxic mortgage securities. Credit Suisse settled similar claims for $5.3 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apple has paid Nokia a royalty for the use of its patents for five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal expires on Dec. 31, however, and Apple is refusing to keep paying, resulting in dozens of lawsuits in 11 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Super Mario &quot;is rife with stale, retrograde gender stereotypes,&quot; a video game critic writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But gamemakers are trying to make competitions, or e-sports, more appealing to women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. stocks were down on Thursday. Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A garden for all seasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our latest 360 video shows how the Young family, a recipient of the New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, created a winter wonderland in the Bronx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beyond sports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of our most-read articles this week was about Steve Kerr, the head coach of the N.B.A.'s Golden State Warriors. He reflects on how his worldview was shaped by the death of his father, who was assassinated while serving as president of the American University of Beirut in Lebanon in 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also look back at the life of Rashaan Salaam, a 1990s college football star who was found dead this month at age 42. He had been working as a counselor for high school students in Colorado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rashaan was trying to save lives, but he had trouble saving his own life,&quot; a colleague said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New at the movies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We review films including &quot;Hidden Figures,&quot; which honors three black women who played vital roles in America's early space program, and Martin Scorsese's &quot;Silence,&quot; about Jesuit priests in 17th-century Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there's a scathing rebuke of &quot;Why Him?&quot;, in which James Franco plays a tech billionaire. It is &quot;trite, crass and insultingly moronic,&quot; our reviewer writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Holiday throwdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Baltic cities are in a feud over which had the world's first decorated Christmas tree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riga, the capital of Latvia, says it was first, in 1510. Tallinn, in Estonia, disputes that. Civic pride and tourist dollars are at stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recipe of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take it easy on yourself and order in, but keep this one-pot French onion soup with garlic croutons in your back pocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all know what it's like to get a less-than-ideal gift. Compare your own this season with some of the oddities our journalists have received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alissa J. Rubin, our Paris bureau chief, remembers that she was given a copper-colored, plasticky statuette of an Egyptian sphinx when she covered the war in Iraq: &quot;It had translucent bright blue eyes, and it would light up.&quot; Another one that sticks out: &quot;A Saddam watch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marc Lacey, our national editor and a former international correspondent, still has an Iraqi translator's disconcerting gift: &quot;A painting by an artist said to have painted Saddam Hussein himself, showing a man in a flowing white robe on a majestic white steed holding a sword toward the heavens. He had my face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim Yardley, our Europe editor, recalls a range of gifts when he was covering </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A plaque with a photograph of a local dam project. A few tea sets. And Olympics swag, including a stuffed doll of one of the Beijing mascots, 'The Friendlies.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Jacobs, a correspondent, remembers another gift to the Beijing bureau: &quot;a compressed Frisbee-sized disc of tea shaped in the image of the Chinese helicopter tycoon who was giving them out.&quot; No one, he says, drank the tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Happy Holidays!</SPAN></P>
