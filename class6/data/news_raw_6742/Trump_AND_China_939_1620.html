<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mr. Kasich aimed to expand on promising poll numbers with an optimistic speech criticizing Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Ted Cruz. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Kasich, the Republican primary's most moderate candidate, worked to expand on promising poll numbers in New York with a speech this morning sharply criticizing Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Ted Cruz, without mentioning them by name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the speech, the Ohio governor cast himself as a nuts-and-bolts choice who is more tolerant, more compassionate, and, as a successful state governor and a budget hawk while in Congress, more adept at handling the nation's economy. That's hardly a leap, given his opponents' vows to deport millions of immigrants, ban Muslims from entering the United States and patrol neighborhoods where they live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polls suggest that Mr. Kasich is the Republican candidate who would give Hillary Clinton the toughest battle in November, should they each become their respective parties' nominees. But he has struggled to gain traction, so far winning only his home state. He is currently in second place in New York, which votes on April 19, behind Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Mr. Kasich remains in the race in hopes that if neither Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nor Mr. Cruz, both deeply unpopular with the party's leadership, garner enough delegates necessary to win the nomination outright, he could prevail in a contested nominating convention in July.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we come together, when we unite as a country, America always wins,&quot; Mr. Kasich said this morning to the Women's National Republican Club, according to the prepared text. Though Mr. Kasich has criticized Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> misogynistic statements, he oddly did not address them in this speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr. Kasich hit </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hard on his immigration and foreign policy stances, such as they are, as part of the &quot;path to darkness&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mr. Cruz represent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have heard proposals to create a religious test for immigration, to target neighborhoods for surveillance, impose draconian tariffs which would crush trade and destroy American jobs,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have heard proposals to drop out of NATO, abandon Europe to Russia, possibly use nuclear weapons in Europe, end our defense partnerships in Asia, and tell our Middle East allies that they have to go it alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been offered hollow promises to impose a value-added tax, balance budgets through simple and whimsical cuts in 'fraud, waste and abuse.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an optimistic speech that aimed to be Reaganesque, Mr. Kasich presented plans for a first 100 days in office. They include a balanced-budget plan, a menu of tax cuts and a plan for welfare, education, Medicaid, highway infrastructure and job training back to where we live in the states and strengthening of the nation's border in combination with a guest worker program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full text of the speech is below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Two Paths&quot; </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> INTRODUCTION </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, thank you to the Women's National Republican Club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a pleasure to be here in this wonderful and historic clubhouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This organization is so steeped in history of its own as well as in the history of this city, our party and the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Women's National Republican Club was founded by leaders of the suffrage movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With their new voting rights in mind, this clubhouse was intended to be a place where women could meet and share knowledge about political issues so as to be better informed participants in the electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As new voters, women could participate in the choice between candidates and ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is in that spirit that I speak to you today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am going to talk today about the choice America faces in this election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a choice between two paths-two very different paths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we make this choice, the world is watching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world is watching because America is civilization's brightest beacon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom-loving people depend on our leadership for peace and stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civilization's enemies only seek our fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidents come and presidents go, and while the President does really matter, it's the democratic principles that have made us that leader for more than two centuries and that have been sturdy enough to transcend political and ideological differences, a civil war, two world wars, and a century of technological and societal upheaval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through it all we have remained history's greatest force for good because we have stayed true to who we are - one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This election may well be one of the most consequential of many generations because the next President will face so many complex pressures - from within and without.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will force tough decisions from not only our leaders but from each of us, and we won't always like our options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues we confront - from fighting ISIS, handling Russia, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> North Korea and the Middle East to addressing displaced workers, civil rights and the new plague of drug addiction at home as well as slow economic growth and rising debt are all &quot;CRITICAL.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The importance of making the right choices certainly cannot be under-stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can overload us if we let it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even in the face of this multitude of complex, thorny problems, clarity can emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the fog of anxiety, the seemingly endless choices can be reduced and then reduced again and reduced again and they eventually are whittled down to just two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here they are: Will we turn our backs on the ideals of America that have seen us through for more than two centuries; or, are we going to reaffirm that America is, in Ronald Reagan's words, &quot;This last best hope for man on earth?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is our choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Path to Darkness </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some, the challenges we face, the myriad choices, the potential changes that each decision presents - it could give rise to fear or anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could be paralyzing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response for some is to retreat into the past-to yearn for &quot;the way things used to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To these people, today's America is only seen as a broken place, and the people who did the breaking are &quot;the other:&quot; people with more money-or less money, people with different-sounding last names, or different religious beliefs, or different colored skin or lifestyles or - whatever...you get the idea...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have been told that, because of all this change, America has become dark, that we have succumbed and that we are no longer strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are told that we are no longer respected in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, we are even told that foreign governments are actually controlling our destiny because they have become smarter than us and tougher than us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This picture of America in economic and moral decline is, of course, always followed up with warnings of our impending destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many Americans these fears and this outlook are as real as the building we are in today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the anger they cause is real.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true, we are fighters in America, but we fight for what is good and what is right - and when we do that we win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we come together, when we unite as a country, America always wins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those who are angry or afraid, I want to assure you there is another, better way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some who feed off of the fears and anger that is felt by some of us and exploit it feed their own insatiable desire for fame or attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That could drive America down into a ditch, not make us great again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as disturbing are the solutions they offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have heard proposals to create a religious test for immigration, to target neighborhoods for surveillance, impose draconian tariffs which would crush trade and destroy American jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have heard proposals to drop out of NATO, abandon Europe to Russia, possibly use nuclear weapons in Europe, end our defense partnerships in Asia, and tell our Middle East allies that they have to go it alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have been offered hollow promises to impose a value-added tax, balance budgets through simple and whimsical cuts in &quot;fraud, waste and abuse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have been promised that unpopular laws shall be repealed simply through the will of a strong man in the White House and that Supreme Court justices will be empowered with some new extra-constitutional ability to investigate former public officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have stood on a stage and watched with amazement as candidates wallowed in the mud, viciously attacked one another, called each other liars and disparaged each other's character.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who continuously push that type of behavior are not worthy of the office they are seeking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as for me, I will not take the low road to the highest office in the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as an all-consuming fear of America in decline ends in visions of America's destruction, a political strategy based on exploiting Americans instead of lifting them up inevitably leads to divisions, paranoia, isolation, and promises that can never, ever be fulfilled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I say to you that this path to darkness is the antithesis of all that America has meant for 240 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> America IS Great </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some have a different response to the pressures they see bearing down on America-and themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would never occur to me that America would break-or could break-from challenges to our economy or security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We harden with resolve through ingenuity and coming together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can't sit by idly and expect fate or destiny to sweep in and rescue us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We always roll up our sleeves and get to work when the going gets tough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have never seen the American spirit fail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's strength is that we are bound by shared ideas, by communities and families and people who are free, creative and giving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is what makes America great, not some politician or some law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spirit of our country rests in us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, notwithstanding all our challenges, America still is great.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take any measure, whether it's life expectancy, medicine, nutrition, technology, innovation, transportation or even economic power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America's economy is still the largest and most productive in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're bigger than the next two economies - </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Japan - combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America still leads the world in making things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America is among the largest exporters of goods and services in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America is home to six out of the top ten universities in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America is the world's inventor and leads in intellectual property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't let anybody, particularly a politician, tell you that America is not great.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That doesn't mean we aren't capable of drifting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can-and we have been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, too many Americans are still being left behind-or are making it but feel betrayed by a system that became &quot;too big to fail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too many feel that government and politicians have betrayed them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a lot of Americans who ask why no one is speaking for them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is it, no one is working for you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is it, you hear all these promises from politicians and nothing comes of it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, you are right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For too long, politicians have been making promises based upon polling or what was politically expedient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is not leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leadership is the willingness to walk a lonely road with a team of people with their eyes fixed on the horizon focused on solving problems and healing our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading is serving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another Path </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a better, higher path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True leadership means pursuing it, even if it is hard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sacrifice is part of the job, however, because leaders can't lead unless they are servants first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To run for President you have to respect the dignity of a job where close to 320 million people are depending on you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our campaigns should be full of ideas that provide energy and solutions, innovations and excitement for whatever office we are running for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because we all have to look our families in the eyes and know that we raised the bar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want to be able to look my wife and daughters in the eyes and know that they're proud of me and the campaign we are running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American leadership is at its finest when it buckles on that irrepressible &quot;can do&quot; spirit that says anything is possible and that everyone can participate in America's blessings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You see, we can restore our economy, rebuild our military, make America safe from terrorism and re-engage as the leader in the world again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can do this with reasonable and proven solutions rooted in the American ideals that have seen us through tough days before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proven solutions are right in front of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We know what needs to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no better and quicker cure to America's challenges than to grow the economy and stimulate private sector job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To have the resources to solve problems we need economic strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 90s when we balanced the federal budget, paid down the federal debt, cut taxes and created surpluses, the result was a sustained period of economic growth, lower interest rates, job creation and national prosperity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesses were growing, unemployment was at historic lows and nearly anyone who wanted a job, could have one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the labor market became a buyer's market for the job seeker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was no small feat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think for a moment about what we did: for the first time since Americans walked on the moon the federal government had a balanced budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We didn't only balance the budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were also able to reform welfare, end generational dependency; reform the pentagon to strengthen our defenses, cut the capital gains tax and much more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know, I tell younger audiences about this and they look at me like I'm crazy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They don't believe it ever happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, we know it did and it can happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It just takes leadership, the will to challenge the status quo and a willingness to work across the aisle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, we have to be willing to work with the other party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe that Americans are not only fed up with Washington for what they have not done but also tired of the partisan bickering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That doesn't mean you compromise your principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think anyone would accuse Ronald Reagan of compromising his principles, but he did work with the Democrat Speaker, Tip O'Neil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's because Ronald Reagan was a leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The job of a leader is to first slow down and listen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, you set an agenda that meets America's needs and you bring everyone together to make it reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no place for dividing, polarizing, pointing fingers or trading on short term political gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hold to this philosophy of leadership because I watched great leaders practice it successfully and I've seen it work in my own experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I worked for ten years to pass that balanced budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was hard work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I became chairman of the budget committee, our team was able to get it done - even with a Democrat in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were proud when we reformed welfare and as a member of the Armed Services Committee we all came together to reform the Pentagon and realign our military services that resulted in a central command structure that allowed the services to work together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the same formula we used in Ohio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were facing an $8 billion deficit and had lost 350,000 jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a few short years we turned that deficit into a surplus of $2 billion and gave Ohioans the largest tax cut of any state in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We even repealed the death tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ohio has now created 417,000 private sector jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we continue to work to make sure that no one is left behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This can work for America again as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is why I've proposed a 100 Day agenda for when I am President.</SPAN></P>

<DIV CLASS="c15"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, we will fix social security so that we keep the promise to our seniors and future generations.&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
</LI></UL><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we do these things, we will unleash economic growth which means more jobs, higher wages, and the restoration of the American Dream that our children will inherit a better America than we received from our parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With increased stability and strength America can rebuild its military while at the same time reform the pentagon to operate like a 21st century enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will resume leadership of the world and as we do that we will treat our veterans with respect and lift them to make sure they have what they need whether it's healthcare, jobs or housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When America is strong, less dependent on debt and growing economically, we can reclaim our place as a leader in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, when America is strong and actively engaged in the world, the world is a safer place and America is a safer place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know, this is why we do these things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is about how we want our country to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You see, economic growth is not an end unto itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a means to make possible everything we want for our nation and our communities and our families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, by the way, as we have growth, we have the ability to bring in from the cold those who live in the shadows, those who are forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poor, the mentally ill, the disabled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Americans, we believe that everyone deserves a chance to get ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We give them the chance when we give them a hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone should have an opportunity to pursue their God given destiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The American Spirit </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, there is much to fix in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, there are reasons for our anxieties and fears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our country has been drifting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because we have forgotten the formula that makes us strong and caved to political considerations instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've seemed to have lost our way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are stalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are at risk of jeopardizing a better future for our children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I understand why Americans are fearful and distrustful and looking for a reason for the way they feel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was raised in a small Pennsylvania steel town where if the wind blew the wrong way, people would be out of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's awful to feel that insecurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To feel that circumstances are out of your control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To feel like nobody cares and all the institutions have abandoned you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, we Americans have overcome challenges before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some think that the anger some Americans are expressing is defined by some nostalgic look backward for simpler times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't agree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Americans are looking for is that quality of leadership we are sorely missing from the past to address today's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At each moment of crises in America, we have united as a country and a people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's always been our secret weapon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's so simple but it is also invincible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I spoke earlier about the spirit of our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, let me say, our strength and spirit does not reside with a president or any politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our strength resides within ourselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spirit of our country rests in the neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It rests in our people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are the ones with the strength to change the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The power is within each and every one of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A united America is undefeatable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are an exceptional country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's because we are the exception in history - we are not an ethnic group or religion or language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are that last great hope for earth that Reagan often spoke of, because we have shown that when people from many different backgrounds and ideas and beliefs come together with a common, noble purpose-to be free and just-we are unbeatable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two Paths </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two paths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One choice-the path that exploits anger, encourages resentment, turns fear into hatred and divides people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This path solves nothing, demeans our history, weakens our country and cheapens each of us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has but one beneficiary and that is to the politician who speaks of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other path is the one America has been down before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is well trod, it is at times steep, but it is solid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the same path our forebears took together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is from this higher path that we are offered the greater view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, imagine for a moment with me that view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fear turns to hope because we remember to take strength from each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uncertainty turns to peace because we reclaim our faith in the American ideals that have carried us upward before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And America's supposed decline becomes its finest hour, because we came together to say &quot;no&quot; to those who would prey on our human weakness and instead chose leadership that serves, helping us look up, not down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the path I believe in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the America I believe in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, this is the America I know all Americans want us to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Please, join me on this higher path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together, united, we can reclaim the America we love and hold so dear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And lift all of us up to partake in its, and the Lord's, many blessings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you.</SPAN></P>
