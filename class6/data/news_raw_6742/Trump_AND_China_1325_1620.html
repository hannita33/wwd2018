</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good evening. Here's the latest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. President Obama commuted most of the prison sentence of Chelsea Manning, the army intelligence analyst sentenced to 35 years in prison for giving a massive trove of secret documents to WikiLeaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Manning, already jailed for nearly seven years, will be freed in May. That rescues Ms. Manning, who has tried to commit suicide twice in prison, from an uncertain future as a transgender woman in a male prison.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A White House spokesman stressed the differences between Ms. Manning's clemency application and the pardon application of Edward Snowden, the security contractor who disclosed archives of top secret surveillance files and is living in exile in Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nominee for secretary of health and human services, Tom Price, is on Capitol Hill this week for his Senate confirmation hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He'll face hard questions over his trades of medical stocks. If confirmed, he'll lead the effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new report from the Congressional Budget Office said the repeal would cost 18 million people their insurance in the first year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Nigerian fighter jets hunting for Boko Haram militants mistakenly bombed a refugee camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The medical organization Doctors Without Borders said at least 52 people were killed and 200 injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This large-scale attack on vulnerable people who have already fled from extreme violence is shocking and unacceptable,&quot; said an official with the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A sense of uncertainty is taking hold around the globe as the U.S. prepares for the inauguration of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The predictably unpredictable president-elect upset the leaders of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and various European nations with provocative comments in newly published interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inauguration and related events could cost more than $200 million - possibly more than half of it for security. In Washington, which Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> calls &quot;the swamp&quot; and where 91 percent of voters went for Hillary Clinton, &quot;full-scale panic&quot; is setting in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Britain's leader backed a clean break from the European Union, its single market and its court system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a long-awaited speech on &quot;Brexit,&quot; Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted a &quot;new and equal partnership&quot; with European nations that would allow Britain to regain control of immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The Turkish authorities say the Uzbek man accused of killing 39 people at an Istanbul nightclub on New Year's Day, above, confessed after being captured. The Islamic State had claimed responsibility for the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the widow of Omar Mateen, who pledged allegiance to Islamic State as he killed 49 people at an Orlando nightclub last year, appeared in court. She is charged with aiding and abetting in the attack, and obstructing the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Almost three years after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people on board, officials called off the search in the southern Indian Ocean, the largest and costliest search in aviation history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatives of those lost were distraught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can't imagine living the rest of my life accepting that people just disappeared into thin air,&quot; said a woman whose mother was on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Above, debris was recovered on an island near Madagascar in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. We visited the Office of Presidential Correspondence, where a small army of employees and interns read the letters sent by millions of Americans to President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are tales of woe, joy, pleas for pardons or help with medical bills, a teenager's report card - all sorts of writings. The team sifts through them, and hands Mr. Obama 10 to read each night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in the last installment of our six-part series on Mr. Obama's legacy, we took a look at how the presidency changed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. A small triangular pendant found during the excavation of a Nazi death camp has intrigued Anne Frank experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's engraved with the words &quot;good luck&quot; in Hebrew. Researchers determined that it likely belonged to a 14-year-old girl: Karoline Cohn, born in Frankfurt in 1929. It was almost identical to one owned by Anne, who was born there the same year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now they're trying to determine if the girls could have been friends, or even relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Finally, Americans tend to take less time off than their counterparts in industrialized countries. One survey found the average respondent took 12 vacation days when they had 15. (In Spain, they were 30 for 30.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Guilt and worry&quot; were common rationales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So here are some tips to make sure you take that break you earned: plan early, get organized, and remember what you're owed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
