<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;American officials said they were still trying to determine whether the taking of the unmanned ship in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea was a low-level action or a strategic order.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - The Pentagon on Friday demanded the return of an underwater drone that was seized by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as an American crew was moving in to retrieve it. The episode threatens to increase tensions in a region already fraught with great-power rivalries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Chinese warship had been shadowing the Bowditch, a United States naval vessel, in the international waters of the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea when the Chinese launched a small boat and snatched the unmanned underwater vehicle, the Pentagon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ignoring radio demands from the Americans to return the drone, the Chinese ship sailed off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The episode set off one of the tensest standoffs between Beijing and Washington in 15 years and occurred a day after the Chinese signaled that they had installed weapons along a string of disputed islands in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seizure of the drone brought a formal protest from the United States at a time when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is extending claims over the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea and is watching the United States - and its incoming president - with wariness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The episode did not have the life-or-death drama of the April 2001 midair collision between a Chinese fighter jet and a Navy surveillance plane that forced the Americans to make an emergency landing on Chinese territory. Acknowledging the odd nature of Chinese sailors seizing the drone close to its American mother ship, one official here likened it to watching a thief steal a wallet in broad daylight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials said they were still trying to determine whether the seizure was a low-level action taken by Chinese sailors who spotted the drone - which the Pentagon said was conducting scientific research - or a strategic-level action ordered by more senior Chinese leaders to challenge the American presence in those waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We call upon </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to return&quot; the underwater vehicle &quot;immediately,&quot; Peter Cook, the Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement Friday, &quot;and to comply with all of its obligations under international law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident complicates already testy relations between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States, ties that have been further frayed by President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> phone call with the president of Taiwan. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> angered Chinese officials by holding a phone conversation with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, an island that Beijing deems a breakaway province of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. It had been nearly four decades since a United States president or president-elect had such direct contact with a Taiwanese leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also criticized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over its trade imbalance with the United States, its military activities in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea and its links to North Korea. Aides to the president-elect have defended Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> words and actions as important to bringing a fresh eye to a number of foreign policy issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pentagon officials said on Friday that they were trying to determine if the seizure of the underwater drone had anything to do with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the White House on Friday, President Obama was asked about the issue during a news conference, and he made clear that he viewed the question of Taiwan as especially sensitive. While the president refrained from directly criticizing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he warned his successor to carefully consider his actions and any new policy, lest he ignite what could be a significant response from Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think all of our foreign policy should be subject to fresh eyes,&quot; Mr. Obama said. But he added: &quot;For </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the issue of Taiwan is as important as anything on their docket. The idea of a One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is at the heart of their conception of a nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And so if you are going to upend this understanding, you have to have thought through what the consequences are, because the Chinese will not treat that the way they'll treat other issues,&quot; he said, adding that the Chinese would not even treat it the way they treated issues around the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, &quot;where we've had a lot of tensions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> experts said on Friday that it was unclear whether the seizure of the American drone was linked to anger in Beijing over Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, or a continuation of years of tensions over competing claims in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bowditch episode came after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> signaled on Thursday that it had installed weapons on disputed islands in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea that it would use to repel threats. In describing the new weapons deployment, a Defense Ministry statement suggested that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was further watering down a pledge made by its president, Xi Jinping, to not militarize the islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That indicated that such installations were part of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plan to deepen its territorial claim over the islands, which has created tensions with its neighbors over their rival claims and with Washington over freedom of navigation in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, one of the world's busiest commercial waterways. The United States Navy routinely sends warships to sail the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea as part of ongoing American policy meant to demonstrate that all countries have the freedom of navigation in disputed waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M. Taylor Fravel, an associate professor of political science at M.I.T. who studies </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> territorial disputes and has written on the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, called the seizure of the drone &quot;a big deal, as it represents the deliberate theft of U.S. government property and a clear violation&quot; of maritime law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By stealing a drone versus threatening the safety of the ship, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may be trying to find a way to signal its opposition to U.S. activities without creating a larger incident,&quot; Mr. Fravel said. &quot;Nevertheless, it will be viewed by the U.S. as a clear challenge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bowditch, an oceanographic ship, was operating in international waters and carrying out scientific research, said Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. The drone was part of an unclassified program to collect oceanographic data, including salinity in the sea, clarity of water and ocean temperature, factors that can help the military in its collection of sonar data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese Navy ship, which had been shadowing the American ship, approached within 500 yards of the Bowditch before seizing the drone, which American officials say was around 50 nautical miles northwest of Subic Bay, the Philippines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the case, the Pentagon said that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had no right to seize the drone. &quot;This is not the sort of conduct we expect from professional navies,&quot; Captain Davis said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Swaine, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, called the theft &quot;low-level provocation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This doesn't involve lives,&quot; Mr. Swaine said. &quot;It involves the Chinese grabbing something that belongs to the United States. The normal thing to do in these cases is, you issue a d&eacute;marche and demand it be returned ASAP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, criticized the Obama administration for what he called a failure to provide a &quot;strong and determined U.S. response&quot; to Chinese actions in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. &quot;Freedom of the seas and the principles of the rules-based order are not self-enforcing,&quot; he said. &quot;American leadership is required for their defense. But that leadership has been sorely lacking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no immediate comment from Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or his transition team.</SPAN></P>
