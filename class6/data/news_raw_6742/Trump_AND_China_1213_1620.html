<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will hold the next rally in his &quot;thank you&quot; tour in Michigan tonight, following his stop in Iowa on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We look at Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pick for labor secretary, Andrew F. Puzder, a fast-food executive who has been a critic of increasing the federal minimum wage, and at how Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> choice to run the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, could affect efforts to promote alternatives to fossil fuels.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, the incoming president will be credited as an executive producer in the latest installment of the reality TV show &quot;The Apprentice,&quot; which will feature Arnold Schwarzenegger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Impeachment vote in South Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Park Geun-hye has been suspended from office as the Constitutional Court considers whether to formally remove her from the post because of a corruption scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are the accusations against Ms. Park, and some of the contenders to replace her, including Ban Ki-moon, the departing U.N. secretary general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Crisis in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over Memorial Day weekend, The Times tracked every shooting in the city. We returned to the blocks where most of the violence occurred, in the 11thpolice district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about desperation, decadence, depression and rage,&quot; the Rev. Marshall E. Hatch Sr., who has given eulogies for at least 12 victims of violence this year, says of the district. &quot;It's the concentration of all of that, all in one place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our latest 360 video tours one of the city's deadliest neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Guilty verdict against Dutch politician. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geert Wilders, the far-right contender to become the next prime minister of the Netherlands, was convicted today of inciting discrimination for saying in 2014 that the country would be safer with fewer Moroccans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wilders received no punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> War in Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Syrian Army has stopped combat operations in Aleppo to evacuate civilians, according to Russian officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But residents said that they could hear drones and tank fire, and that they feared government forces were closing in on the remaining few rebel-held neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aftermath of Indonesia earthquake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A two-week state of emergency has been declared in Aceh Province, where a 6.5-magnitude earthquake killed more than 100 people and injured hundreds this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New evidence of Russian doping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 1,000 athletes in over 30 sports have been implicated in the latest investigation into the nation's doping program. The report builds on the work conducted by a Canadian lawyer that was released this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Hassan Rouhani of Iran has signed a wave of oil deals with European and Asian energy companies in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our officials are in a rush to sign contracts with big oil companies in order to have leverage when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> enters the White House,&quot; said an economist with close ties to Iran's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Microsoft acquired LinkedIn for $26.2 billion. But there are ample reasons to be skeptical that the deal, the biggest by far in Microsoft's history, will pay off, our reporter observes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Jordan owns the right to his name in Chinese characters, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> highest court ruled, in a landmark decision for future trademark cases brought by foreign companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. stocks were up on Thursday. Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In memoriam: John Glenn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first American to orbit Earth died on Thursday at 95.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Glenn also had a decades-long career as a U.S. senator from Ohio. At 77, he got his wish to return to orbit and became the oldest person to go into space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite his incredible achievements, he often played down his heroic status. &quot;I don't think of myself that way,&quot; he said in an interview a few years ago. &quot;I get up each day and have the same problems others have at my age.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The year's best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of our film critics picked &quot;Moonlight&quot; and the documentary &quot;O.J.: Made in America&quot; among their favorite movies of 2016. Read their full lists here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also compiled a list for the finest works on the small screen, which isn't easy, one of our TV critics writes: &quot;The idea that a critic can watch all the television there is today, let alone isolate the 10 best works among wildly different genres, is a fiction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking of TV ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We review NBC's latest musical, &quot;Hairspray Live!,&quot; and rank the best stage productions shown on television in the past few years. One theme that has emerged: &quot;Pop stars aren't Broadway stars.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A step closer to Olympic glory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Olympic Committee voted this week to recognizecheerleading, laying the groundwork for it to apply to be part of the Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's abrief history of the sport, and some of its famous participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recipe of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Start the weekend with a &quot;Mississippi-style&quot; Chicken tetrazzini, a twist on a classic restaurant dish named after an Italian opera star.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this day in 1917, the First World War was entrenched in some of its darkest days. The Allies were in a stalemate on the Western Front, and good news was in short supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it was a huge morale booster for the Allies when Turkish forces surrendered the holy city of Jerusalem to Gen. Edmund Allenby of Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister David Lloyd George called it &quot;a Christmas present for the British people.&quot; The New York Herald's front page proclaimed: &quot;Jerusalem is rescued by British after 673 years of Moslem Rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jews in the city, inspired a month earlier by Britain's Balfour Declaration in support of a Jewish homeland, rejoiced. Some Arabs, many of whom had been conscripted by the Ottomans, danced in the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two more details:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When General Allenby entered the Old City, he did so on foot and unfurled no flags, in a sign of respect. He also deployed Muslim troops to ease sectarian tension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until he arrived, the mayor of Jerusalem had been scrambling to find a British official to whom he could cede control. An army cook who got lost while looking for food was initially asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He declined, saying, &quot;I don't want the city; I want eggs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles McDermid contributed reporting.</SPAN></P>
