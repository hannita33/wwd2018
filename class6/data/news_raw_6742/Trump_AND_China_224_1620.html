<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editorial writers and opinion columnists around the world have reacted to Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election as the 45th president of the United States. Below is a sampling of their views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Disgust Has Become the Principal Engine' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Editorial in the Reforma newspaper, Mexico</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The victory of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> confirms some lessons that everybody already knew ... but which nobody wanted to understand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The first is that disgust has become the principal engine of elections. Forget policy proposals: People are voting for personalities, not for candidates; for likability, not ideology; to reject someone, not out of conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The second was seen in Brexit and in the ''no'' to the Colombia peace plan. ... Voters do not feel represented by their government, nor by the parties. ...</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The third and perhaps most serious is that this disgust is easily exploitable through populism: telling people what they want to hear; polarizing the world into good guys and bad guys; making campaigns into reality shows; and pushing with such insistence the button of false patriotism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'Demagogic Degeneracy'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Editorial in the Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the United States were a banana republic, the outcome of this election would be damaging only for its unfortunate inhabitants. But this nation provides international security and global economic stability. One false step by the government of the United States could drag the rest of the world into turmoil that only benefits those who are careless or enemies of Western values. These are not signs of optimism. Since brazen lying was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> main electoral weapon, it's hard to know if he's being honest when he promises to govern for all Americans. What is clear is that he didn't present any credentials for occupying the world's most important political position, aside from his distinguished handling of demagogic degeneracy. God save America!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'A Moment of Great Peril'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Editorial in The Financial Times of Britain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The world waits nervously to see if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policies are as incendiary as his words. The shift to a more positive tone since the election result is a first step. But this remains a moment of great peril. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory, coming after the Brexit referendum vote in Britain, looks like another grievous blow to the liberal international order. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> must decide, by his actions and words, whether he intends to contribute to the great unraveling, at incalculable cost to the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'Europe Is Not Protected'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Editorial in the French newspaper Le Monde</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election is an earthquake, a game changer for Western democracy. Like the fall of the Berlin Wall and 9/11, this event marks the beginning of a new world where only one thing is certain: in this new place, everything that was once thought impossible, or unrealistic, is now conceivable. Each country is different, but the anger common in every one is rooted in a broad fear of globalization that focuses on two themes: immigration control and income inequality. The British cast their Brexit votes with those in mind. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> predicted his victory would be a ''Brexit times 10.'' He was right. And this is also a way of saying that Europe is not protected from the seismic shift that has just shaken Washington to the core. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Unfortunately for her, Hillary Clinton embodied perfectly the quintessence of the American political elite. Rightly or wrongly, her image reflected the status quo -- despite her having the most solid and achievable program. There are many lessons to be learned from this election. Traditional political parties must take heed. So must the media and the pollsters, who for the most part, did not predict this outcome and no longer know how to gauge public opinion. These lessons are all the more vital because those who represent the voices of protest anger, whether it be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or his European clones, have no idea how to solve these complex problems. They sell illusions, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the master illusionist. They live off simplistic arguments which threaten our democracies. From Paris, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory coming after Brexit is another prescient warning. In this new postelection world, everything is possible. The prospect that we in France are still unable to look at in the eye looms: the rise to power of the far right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'A Revolutionary Nation'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Maurizio Molinari, editor in chief of the Italian daily La Stampa, in a front-page editorial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  America is a revolutionary nation where populism asserted itself in 1829 with the election of Andrew Jackson; it's a phenomenon to be respected even by those who do not share in it. More so because it is something that affects us closely, being very similar to the discontent of the European middle class that generated ''Brexit'' and that nurtures a heterogeneous galaxy of protest movements from France, to Germany, to our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'A Synonym for Uncertainty and Ambiguity'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tatyana Stanovaya, head of the analytical department at the Center for Political Technologies, in the Russian newsmagazine Republic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has presented pro-Putin elites with a hope (largely irrational) that this force majeur -- and that's how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sudden victory can be viewed -- will break the unequivocal anti-Russian trend... Even if that hope won't materialize (and chances are high that it won't), </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory is perceived by Russian elites as a tactical advantage. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a synonym of uncertainty and ambiguity, of the old logical and axiological constructions being demolished, of a moderate, however temporary, demoralization of the American political class and of Washington's allies. Even if the Kremlin supports </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it's far from placing a bet on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as such. This is a game with an aim to cause internal chaos in the most problematic foreign policy partner of Russia ... </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election is also a moral and psychological victory for Putin by which he gains a very strong case about the crisis of traditional Western democracy and its institutions, about peoples' fatigue from politicians who ''grew detached from reality,'' about the civilizational crisis of the West where citizens have found a way to voice their protest by electing ''freaks.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'Strange Victory'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ahmad Abdel-Tawab, columnist for the state-run Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Much will be said about the strange victory of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- despite the suspicious consensus of the largest American newspapers and televisions, which predicted his defeat. The press sought to destroy him with vicious, organized campaigns, accusing him of being inexperienced and perverted, selfish and aggressive, etc. Alongside them, opinion polls that claimed to follow scientific methods claimed he would lose, putting forward numbers and percentages showing him to be the loser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That itself needs extensive study. It questions assumptions about the active role of advertising in political races, and the role of direct communication between the people whom </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relied on until he achieved his unexpected win -- which he achieved with an overwhelming majority. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We must now consider the positive points on which we can cooperate -- especially his clear statements to fight terrorism and particularly his promise to eliminate the Islamic State. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As for Hillary Clinton, her loss will bring many gains for Egypt and the Arab region. She was involved in every act of sabotage which befell the region since even before she became secretary of state. She adopted the policy of relying on so-called moderate Islam, and considered the Muslim Brotherhood group one of the moderates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'Bad for India Because He Is Bad for His Own Country'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bobby Ghosh, editor in chief, in The Hindustan Times of India</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An Islamophobe is bad for India, not least because Islam is one of India's faiths, practiced by 15 percent of its people: Anyone who seeks to harm Muslims seeks to harm 150 million Indians. A Sinophobe is bad for India because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a pillar of the global economy, of which this country is now a part. A man who harbors racist views about one set of brown people -- Latin Americans, say -- is unlikely to think well of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But perhaps most important, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is bad for India because he is bad for his own country, and the well-being of the U.S. is now closely connected to our own. There is every indication that his leadership will harm American interests, at home and abroad. Even the attempt to keep some of his more outlandish promises -- to build a wall along the border with Mexico; to tear up defense treaties with NATO, Japan and Korea; to reverse policies designed to forestall climate change -- will weaken the U.S., just when India's ties to it are at their strongest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'A Powerful Emotional Shock'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Editorial in The Global Times, a nationalist newspaper in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some people have called this a ''political uprising,'' or an American ''Cultural Revolution.'' Although these descriptions may be far-fetched, they do capture something of the current ideological and political spirit of America. Although </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name has long become familiar worldwide, the United States and the world were never mentally prepared for him to become U.S. president. ... Therefore his victory will first of all bring a powerful emotional shock. His election has left people with a feeling of their frameworks being smashed and foundations shaking. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> foreign policy will be one of the areas of greatest uncertainty. The direction of Sino-U.S. and Russian-U.S. relations will affect international relations in their entirety. ... There might be more of an element of bargaining in Sino-U.S. relations, and arguments over some key interests will sharpen, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interest in a new kind of Sino-U.S. great power relationship should be greater than Obama's, who was heavily influenced by Hillary Clinton's foreign-policy thinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'The Nightmare Has Come True'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Editorial in JoongAng Ilbo, a newspaper in South Korea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The nightmare has come true. A political outsider with no government experience has become the president of the United States, the world's most powerful country. This is a shocking and momentous event that defies common sense and conventional wisdom. He is a business tycoon prone to obscene conduct, malicious speech and eccentricity. His election is an epochal phenomenon that eclipses Brexit. The victory of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Black Swan showed how deep was American voters' distrust of the established political order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'An Inward-Looking United States'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Editorial in the Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There is no doubt that the global leadership of the United States will come into question with the emergence of a president who openly puts a priority on the interests of an inward-looking United States. If Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seriously desires to recover the strong America he called for during his election campaign, we hope he will rebuild trust and return to American values once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  'Not the Country We Thought It Was'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hugh White, professor of strategic studies at Australian National University, in The Australian Financial Review</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now we know. For 20 years, Australians have been happy to assume that America had the strength and resolve to remain the world's leading power. In particular, our leaders have assured us that we can rely on America's power and judgment to manage </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rise, to keep Asia stable and Australia safe. But now we know that America is not the country we thought it was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Americans themselves will of course be in deep shock at this outcome, and it may take some time for the shape of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> new America to become clear. But we can be pretty sure that the old image of America's role in the world, so confidently asserted by the policy elites on both sides of the U.S. political divide, has been smashed by American voters. They have elected as president a man who does not believe in the vision of American leadership on which Australia has for so long relied. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The reality is that while American political leaders and policy intellectuals have talked incessantly about America's unchallengeable power and unshakable resolve, its voters and taxpayers -- and the social-economic classes that provide most of the soldiers -- have seen money and often lives wasted in a long series of policy failures. Who can wonder that an electorate already angry about economic stagnation and poor services turn their backs on all this.</SPAN></P>
