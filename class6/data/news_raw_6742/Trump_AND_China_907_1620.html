<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to hold news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took questions from reporters this morning, his first formal news conference since July. Here are some of the highlights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It came a day after news that U.S. intelligence agencies presented Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with unsubstantiated reports that Russia had collected salacious information about him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;FAKE NEWS,&quot; he responded on Twitter. On Wednesday, the Kremlin denied having any compromising material on the president-elect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What we know about the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intelligence officials considered it so potentially explosive that President Obama and congressional leaders were also briefed on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times has checked on a number of the details in the memos - some titillating, others that would amount to extremely serious acts - but discounted them as unproven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BuzzFeed posted online the full document with unverified claims, stirring a debate about thecredibility of the news media. &quot;Not an easy or simple call,&quot; the site's editor in chief said, &quot;but publishing this dossier reflects how we see the job of reporters in 2017.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senate hearings for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rex W. Tillerson, the president-elect's choice for secretary of state, headlines today's proceedings. Up to six nominees were to face questions today, but many meetings have been rescheduled. Here's what to watch for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At his hearing on Tuesday, the pick for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions, spoke out against the use of torture and a proposed ban on Muslim immigration. He also pledged to &quot;say no&quot; if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tries to go above the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Yes, we did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tearful President Obama capped his farewell address on Tuesday night with a play on the phrase that swept him into office in 2008. He also warned Americans not to take democracy for granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;America is not a fragile thing,&quot; the president said. &quot;But the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assured.&quot; Here is the full text and video of the speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dylann Roof receives death sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jurors unanimously condemned to death the white supremacist for killing nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston, S.C., in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal law classifies the decision as a binding &quot;recommendation,&quot; and the case is likely to go through years of appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ruling affecting religious freedom in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Court of Human Rights sided with Swiss school officials who ordered a Muslim couple in 2008 to enroll their daughters in a mandatory swimming class with boys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision could set an important precedent for cases in which religious and secular values come into conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beijing-Taipei tensions escalate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sent its sole aircraft carrier into the Taiwan Strait today, a provocative move that follows a phone call last month between Taiwan's president and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taiwan, considered by Beijing to be a Chinese province, has been governed separately since 1949.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Volkswagen is on the verge of pleading guilty to criminal charges in the U.S. and paying $4.3 billion in fines to resolve a federal investigation into its cheating on emissions tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fox News secretly settled sexual harassment accusations against Bill O'Reilly, the network's top host, last summer, documents show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As many cities and states increase their minimum wages, two new studies raise questions about how effective such moves are in helping certain workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. stocks were mixed on Tuesday. Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She broke the news of World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1939, Clare Hollingworth was less than a week into her first job as a newspaper correspondent when she spotted German troops and tanks concealed in a valley, ready to invade Poland. Her story was later deemed &quot;probably the greatest scoop of modern times.&quot; Ms. Hollingworth died on Tuesday at 105.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meet Breitbart's man in Rome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas Williams, a former priest, is a new correspondentfor Breitbart News, the populist, right-wing website that is looking to expand in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lights are on in Detroit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 65,000 new streetlights, the slowly recovering city is sending a message: It's O.K. to go out after dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A bird's-eye view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Telef&eacute;rico in La Paz, Bolivia, is one of the longest aerial cable car systems in the world. It transports an average of 60,000 passengers each day. Our 360 video takes you on a ride.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norway is trying to make audio history this week. The country is beginning an experiment to switch off its FM stations and replace them with digital radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the plan succeeds, it could be the beginning of a change in how we listen to radio around the globe. Britain, Denmark and Switzerland are considering the same move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Norway, where terrestrial radio remains quite popular, was among the first countries to adopt digital radio, in the 1990s. The government's current effort is aimed at improving audio quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was also a goal in the creation of FM radio, which offers staticless, high-fidelity broadcasting. Edwin Armstrong, an American inventor, is credited with figuring out how to transmit sound by modulating the frequency of electromagnetic waves (FM) instead of their amplitude (AM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later built his own FM station to prove its worth to skeptics, though his triumph was marred by legal battles over patents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times called Mr. Armstrong one of the &quot;great inventive geniuses in electrical engineering&quot; after his death in 1954. &quot;He always preferred to be the master of his own laboratory. That he was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
