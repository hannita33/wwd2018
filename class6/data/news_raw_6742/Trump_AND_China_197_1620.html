<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vowed on Tuesday that as president, he would put an end to policies that send American jobs overseas, threatening to impose tariffs on Chinese imports and promising to punish companies that relocate their manufacturing to countries with cheaper labor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It will be American hands that remake this country,'' said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, standing before a hunk of aluminum at a recycling plant in western Pennsylvania. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But such declarations are at odds with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> long history as a businessman, in which he has been heavily -- and proudly -- reliant on foreign labor in the name of putting profits, rather than America, first. From cheap neckties to television sets, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has benefited from some of the trade practices he now scorns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Far-flung apparel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Besides construction, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is big in the clothing business. But most of his line of suits, ties and cuff links bear a ''Made in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' label. Some also come from factories in Bangladesh, Mexico and Vietnam. He has blamed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> currency manipulation to argue that it is almost impossible to find garments that are made domestically these days, or that they are prohibitively expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The answer is very simple,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told  ABC News when asked about his merchandise in 2011. ''Because of the fact that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> so manipulates their currency, it makes it almost impossible for American companies to compete.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite that claim, some companies such as Brooks Brothers continue to make clothes in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Furniture from abroad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2013, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> teamed with Dorya, a Turkish maker of luxury furniture, for his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Home brand. In a news release at the time, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization promoted the craftsmanship of the pieces, which furnish some of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hotels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The entire production process, from the moment the raw wood is cut until the product is finished or upholstered occurs in Dorya's Izmir, Turkey, production facility,'' the release said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also invested in a line of crystal bearing his name to go with his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Home line. The collection was produced in Slovenia, the home of his wife, Melania. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told The New York Times in 2010 that the production facilities were first class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I've seen factories over there; their glass and crystal works are unbelievable,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Putting Romanians and Poles to work</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not held back when it comes to his concern that undocumented immigrants are taking jobs from American workers, but he has used them on occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 1980, a contractor hired by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to demolish the Bonwit Teller building in New York and make way for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower used undocumented Polish immigrants who reportedly worked round-the-clock and even slept at the site. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that he did not know they were undocumented and later settled a lawsuit over the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last summer, The Washington Post found that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was using undocumented immigrants for the construction of his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Hotel at the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And The Times reported this year that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had employed hundreds of foreign guest workers from Romania and other countries at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that he found it difficult to find qualified local people to work there during the high season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For outsourcing before he was against it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has for years railed against trade and currency policies that he says are unfair, he has not always been opposed to outsourcing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Writing on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University blog in 2005, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> acknowledged that foreign labor was sometimes needed to keep American companies from going out of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If a company's only means of survival is by farming jobs outside its walls, then sometimes it's a necessary step,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wrote. ''The other option might be to close its doors for good.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> usually makes the case that foreign labor is necessary to keep production costs down, but in an interview with David Letterman in 2012 he also offered a humanitarian argument for outsourcing. Teased for selling dress shirts that were made in Bangladesh, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> expressed pride that he was creating jobs around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That's good, we employ people in Bangladesh,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. ''They have to work, too.''</SPAN></P>
