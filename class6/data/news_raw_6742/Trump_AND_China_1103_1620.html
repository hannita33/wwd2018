</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good morning.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We're trying something new for our readers in Asia: a morning briefing to jump-start your day.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What do you like? What do you want to see here? Email us with your feedback at asiabriefing@nytimes.com  . </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here's what you need to know: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to report that growth held stable in the third quarter, but the overall picture is a slowing economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country &quot;has reached the end of the road when it comes to its export- and investment-led growth model,&quot; one analyst said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our financial reporter looks at what could happen next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the northern city of Mosul from the Islamic State could take years, even with thehelp of roughly half of the 5,000 U.S. troops now in the country. Our reporting team sent this account from the front lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Islamic State is also on the defensive in Syria, where it has been making preparations for survival. Its propaganda arm is trying to soften the symbolic damage of losses on the battlefield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those were President Obama's words for Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as he called on the Republican candidate to stop trying to &quot;discredit the elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's unprecedented,&quot; Mr. Obama said of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accusations that the coming American presidential election is rigged. &quot;It happens to be based on no facts.&quot; Mr. Obama spoke at a news conference with the Italian prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hackedemails released by WikiLeaks revealed several of the people Hillary Clinton passed over as a running mate, including Bill Gates, her rival for the Democratic nomination Bernie Sanders and Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mrs. Clinton, who has been off the campaign trail for days, face off in their third and final debate on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will ascend the throne, possibly as early as Friday, the head of the country's military government said, reversing a statement that the coronation would not take place for a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the king died last week, the prince said he was not ready to take the throne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> once the top phone maker in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vast smartphone market, is losing ground over its handling of the troubled Galaxy Note 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South Korean company said the phone was safe even as it recalled more than two million of the phones in the United States and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an issue of deception,&quot; said a customer. &quot;They are cheating Chinese consumers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  18 employees from one of Australia's largest hotel and casino operators for charges related to &quot;gambling crimes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move raised fears that the government could be cracking down on overseas operators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is grappling with a new employment problem: how to find work for enough of the hundreds of thousands of migrants who've been streaming to the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Permanent jobs have been elusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the Beijing-based entertainment conglomerate, held an event in Los Angeles to promote its $5 billion &quot;movie metropolis&quot; in Qingdao, about 450 miles north of Shanghai. The company, which has made huge investments in the Hollywood film industry, is offering a 40 percent rebate to studios that decide to film there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around the Web</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Career Women Battle Japan's 'Salaryman' Culture.&quot; The government wants 15 percent of all private company executives to be women by 2020. It won't be easy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mars: Inside the High-Risk, High-Stakes Race to the Red Planet.&quot; Hazards include bone loss and brain damage, and that's before you get there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;India's Wushu Warrior Girl.&quot; A Muslim teenager uses a Chinese martial art to hit back at prejudice and patriarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has lost internet access, and WikiLeaks blamed Ecuador, whose London embassy has been sheltering him for four years. The Ecuadorean government reaffirmed its commitment to providing Mr. Assange political asylum but would not comment on the internet issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">, The Times's David McCraw writes dozens of lawyer letters every year. He knew, of course, that the one he wrote to Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lawyer would be different. This is how Mr. McCraw reacted to the exchange that has since gone viral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> think about winning the Nobel Prize? The Swedish Academy doesn't know. It hasn't spokenwith him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stories about Wall Street traders swindling investors. But one dealmaker and avid art collector claims he was scammed by a professor and her son, who sold him forged paintings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stock market has hit near-record heights this year, despite myriad reasons for anxiety: the U.S. presidential elections, &quot;Brexit,&quot; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic slowdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some analysts warn that a &quot;severe fall&quot; could be coming. They see a worrisome parallel in the current highs to the run-up to Black Monday, the global crash that sent stocks plummeting on this date in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 500 points in New York, a 22.6 percent decline that remains the largest in the index's history - even outstripping the 1929 plunge that heralded the Great Depression. Investors in U.S. stocks lost an estimated $1 trillion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Computerized trading systems were new, enabling a sell-off at a scale not seen before. More than 600 million shares were traded in New York, above. The American Stock Exchange's disk drives ran out of storage space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High-speed trading and communications amplified the crash around the world. Japan took record losses. Hong Kong stopped trading for the rest of the week. Europe's markets were in free fall. &quot;We've never had anything like this,&quot; a European trader said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a crisis on the scale of the Great Depression did not materialize. The drop, in the end, was far more modest than that of 2008. And the markets fully recovered within two years.</SPAN></P>
