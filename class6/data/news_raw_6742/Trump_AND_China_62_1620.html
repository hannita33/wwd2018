<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a night to celebrate strong women. Amy Schumer was the host, Caitlyn Jenner was honored and the guests included Arianna Huffington, Madeleine Albright and the actress Reese Witherspoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also included Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the crowd at Glamour's Women of the Year event on Nov. 9 sat down for dinner at the Rainbow Room, a person at Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> table asked the question that others were no doubt thinking: What would her father, who was being pilloried for remarks that struck many as misogynistic, make of her attending an event like this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> quickly broke the strained silence by saying that she was her own person. Soon after, she and her friend Wendi Deng -- Rupert Murdoch's ex-wife -- left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A spokesman for Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said she went home not because she was uncomfortable, but because it was late and she had two small children. But it was an awkward collision of the two worlds she inhabits: One as a 30-something Manhattan socialite and role model to young professional women, the other as Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> oldest daughter, biggest champion and perhaps most valuable asset.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A lot of women have come and gone over the course of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> life. But through his two high-profile divorces, numerous public romances and three marriages, Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has remained a constant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In interviews, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trumps</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, their friends and people who have done business with them described Donald's and Ivanka's relationship as especially close, with Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> holding an exalted position in the family, in their company, and even in the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> children, she is the acknowledged favorite: ''Daddy's little girl,'' as her older brother Donald Jr. once described her. When Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and her father are not together, she said, they speak as often as five times a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family business, he has given her a level of authority none of his wives, or for that matter executives, have ever had. She handles some of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization's biggest deals, including its acquisition of the Doral Resort in Miami, and its agreement to convert the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C., into a luxury hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wife, Melania, the Slovenian former model, less than comfortable on stage, Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has served as a surrogate political spouse for a candidate who may need one more than anyone else in the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cutting a starkly different image from Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> more combative and impulsive public supporters, like Chris Christie or Sarah Palin, not to mention the candidate himself, Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 34, radiates disciplined poise and practiced reserve. While her father uses Twitter as a grenade launcher, she treats her well-tended social media feeds, which are notably politics-free, as marketing tools for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization and her own line of women's clothing and accessories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On March 15, with her father in the midst of a political clear-cutting through Florida while facing accusations of stirring up racially charged violence at his rallies, she posted a photograph on Instagram highlighting the @TrumpHotels creative team in Waikiki under a serene image of a woman relaxing in a sun-dappled pool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was a fitting image for a devoted daughter who exists as an almost surreally detached counterpoint to her father's bellicosity, and yet may be his most important ally, particularly if he finds himself facing a Democratic opponent who aspires to be the first female president of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tried to do damage control after her father seemed to have made reference to Megyn Kelly's menstrual cycle. She was the unlikely star of a CNN town hall program last week with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family, talking about how her father had encouraged and empowered her. And in a recent interview at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower, Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attacked, however gently, her father's critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What bothers me is how rash people are to make claims as if they knew him and they knew his viewpoint on certain topics,'' she said. ''My father has an enormous heart and truly loves people -- all people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Inside her father's campaign, which has brazenly eschewed the advice of political experts, Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is one of a few people who can, on occasion anyway, influence the candidate's thinking. She failed to persuade Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to apologize for accusing Mexico of sending its ''rapists'' over the border, according to a person close to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak for the campaign. But, this person said, she successfully convinced her father to maintain his qualified support for Planned Parenthood in the face of Republican criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think her father really listens to her, and when I say listens to her I mean I think her father respects her a great deal, and not just because she's his daughter,'' said Carl Icahn, a longtime friend of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family. ''I don't say that lightly. I have a lot of wealthy friends who have kids and a few of them stand out, but not that many.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Born to Run an Empire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the second of three children from Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> marriage to Ivana, a former model from the former Czechoslovakia. She was 8 when she learned about her father's affair with Marla Maples from the horde of photographers waiting for her outside the Chapin School on the Upper East Side. ''Love on the Rocks,'' read the front page of the New York Daily News in the first of many stories about their contentious split.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the public imagination, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had become a symbol of greed and excess. To Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he remained a doting father. And unlike Donald Jr., who did not speak to their father for a year, Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> never blamed him for the divorce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At Chapin, a close friend recalled, Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would check in with him almost every day, calling him -- collect -- from a pay phone tucked away in a janitor's closet. On weekends, he often brought her to visit his various construction sites, or whisked her and her friends off to Palm Beach with him on his jet to play golf and order room service at Mar-a-Lago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After eighth grade, Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parents sent her to boarding school at Choate Rosemary Hall in Connecticut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In college, she was featured prominently in the 2003 documentary ''Born Rich,'' as part of a cast of heirs and heiresses reflecting on their extreme privilege. Most of her co-stars spoke about the corrupting influence of wealth on their young lives. By contrast, Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seemed to idealize her family, speaking about how proud she was of her parents and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name, and showing off her childhood bedroom, with its sweeping view of Central Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There was no hint of teenage rebellion on or off the screen,'' recalled the film's producer, Dirk Wittenborn. ''She had a message to deliver and she delivered it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sought a degree of independence, taking up modeling in part to have her own spending money. (''She's got the best body,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said of his daughter to Howard Stern in 2003. ''She made a lot money as a model -- a tremendous amount.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But she never strayed far from her father. After Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sophomore year at Georgetown, she transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, his alma mater, majoring in real estate. She would soon go to work for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A childhood friend of Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Tamara Goldstein, remembers standing on the roof of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower with her in the summer of 2004, shortly after they had both graduated from college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''How amazing is it that I have an opportunity to change the actual landscape of this skyline,'' Ms. Goldstein recalled Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over the years, Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began to assume more responsibility and autonomy within the family business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In the past, he'd have 10 deals going with lots of different lawyers and nondescript employees,'' said Thomas Barrack, a real estate investor who sold the Plaza Hotel to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 1988 and has remained close to the family since. ''But nobody really had the authority to do anything. That all changed with Ivanka.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Her father still has the final say over what to buy and how much to pay for it, but Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> now personally negotiates almost all of the company's major deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She is very, very trusted by me,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in an interview. ''She has great real-estate instincts and great political instincts.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those who have sat across the table from her describe her as atypically calm and even-tempered in an industry often characterized by threats and bluster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She's been thrust into this environment of high-testosterone real-estate males, and she never loses her cool,'' said Michael Ashner, the chief executive of Winthrop Realty Trust, which sold the Doral to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization in 2011 for $150 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In CNN's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family interview last week, Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cited her power within the family business to defend his attitude toward women. ''So for me, his actions speak louder than the words of many politicians who talk about gender equality but it's not evidenced in their daily employment practices,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Her style may be more low-key than her father's, but like him, Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has also been accused of engaging in hyperbole. A 2010 lawsuit claimed that she, as well as her father and older brother, had in public statements drastically overstated the number of units that had been sold in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SoHo to make the luxury condominium project appear financially healthier than it really was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his co-defendants settled the case, agreeing to refund 90 percent of the plaintiffs' deposits, while admitting no wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ran into some trouble with her own business recently, when 20,000 of her Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-brand scarves were recalled for violating the United States' flammability standards. They, like some of her father's own clothing products, were manufactured in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the kind of outsourcing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is fond of criticizing on the stump.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  From Park Avenue to Politics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and her husband, Jared Kushner, were married in 2009 at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Golf Course in New Jersey. To marry Mr. Kushner, Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had converted to Judaism under an Orthodox rabbi, and she recalled her father wearing a skullcap beneath a huppah erected on the 18th green. Guests were given white flip-flops with the words ''Jared'' and ''Ivanka'' engraved on the insoles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kushner's father, Charles Kushner, had also made a fortune in real estate and was a Democratic power broker in New Jersey. But he was perhaps better known for his fall than his rise. Not long before Jared Kushner and Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> met, Charles Kushner went to prison for tax fraud, election law violations and witness tampering. Among other things, he had hired a prostitute with a hidden camera to entrap his brother-in-law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and her husband now live in a penthouse on Park Avenue with their three young children. Jared Kushner is also doing his part to help sand his father-in-law's rough edges. He has made phone calls on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> behalf to influential Republicans, while the newspaper Mr. Kushner owns, The New York Observer, has been championing his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, meanwhile, has traveled across the country with her father, joining the populist swirl of rallies, polling stations, senior centers and late-night McDonald's runs. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to-go order is two Big Macs; Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who keeps kosher, sticks to the fries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She opened Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign headquarters in New Hampshire, recorded an ad for him in Iowa explaining to voters how to caucus -- ''just write down the name </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and you are done'' -- and has been a fixture on the victory stage, most of the time while pregnant with her third child. (She cannot, however, vote for him in Tuesday's New York primary because she did not switch her party registration from unaffiliated to Republican until late 2015, too late to participate.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She gave birth back home in late March, just as her father was taking to Twitter to attack Senator Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If her brothers, Don Jr. and Eric, have demonstrated a knack for pouring gas on their father's fires, sitting for an interview with a white supremacist radio host (Don Jr.) or comparing waterboarding to a frat-house hazing ritual (Eric), Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> douses flames.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last fall, after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said that the Fox news anchor Megyn Kelly had ''blood coming out of her wherever,'' and criticized Carly Fiorina's physical appearance -- ''Look at that face. Would anybody vote for that?'' -- Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took to CNN to defend her father's treatment of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the recent interview at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower, she said: ''People ask me from a gender perspective, 'He said this and this about women,' and I've said, 'Have you looked at the things he's said about men? Why would our gender be treated differently?' ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> support for her father's candidacy has been unwavering, his emergence as the Republican front-runner has not been without its complications for her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His polarizing campaign has the potential to do lasting damage to the family business she now effectively runs with her brothers. Already, the chef who committed to opening a Spanish restaurant in the new </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hotel in Washington has backed out, citing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> disparaging comments about illegal immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also has her own brand to protect. She avoids advocating her father's proposals and keeps her praise general, trying to balance her dual roles as Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, businesswoman, and Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Donald's devoted and trusted daughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''For all of the naysayers,'' said Ms. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower interview, ''there are many, many more Americans who are deeply inspired by what he's saying, and trust him and love him.''</SPAN></P>
