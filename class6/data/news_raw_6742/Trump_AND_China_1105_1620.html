<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIMA, Peru -- President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, with his ''America First'' campaign slogan, sees an America that has for years been taken for granted by weaker nations and is too quick to intervene in intractable conflicts far away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in his final news conference on his last foreign trip as president, President Obama argued on Sunday for a foreign policy in which America continues to take on the biggest global problems of the day, lead where others stand on the sidelines and help the least fortunate. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama pointed out that before the order imposed in large measure by the United States after World War II, war and famine ravaged the globe. He said that while the United States could not maintain global order on its own, it was the linchpin in ensuring that it continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is an important country, he told reporters in Lima, the final stop on his tour, but the Chinese did not organize the Paris climate talks, help write the agreement to reduce global warming or undertake the negotiations ensuring that all parties agreed to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Russia is a very significant military power, but they're not worrying right now about how to rebuild after a hurricane in Haiti. We are,'' Mr. Obama said, his voice rising. ''And I've said before, that's a burden that we should carry proudly.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama's final overseas trip while in office was supposed to be a valedictory tour, but it has instead been one long exercise in crisis counseling, as he seeks to reassure foreign leaders and audiences that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will not upend alliances and trade relationships that presidents from both major parties have spent decades carefully constructing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His toughest task was here, at a summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group, which helped bring forth the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade accord that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has vowed to kill. Peru, like the rest of Latin America, has also been made uneasy by the prospect of a sudden shift in United States immigration policy under Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The atmosphere during this trip has been noticeably different from that of previous ones. Mr. Obama's schedule has had surprising gaps, when he seemed to have little to do, and staff members -- out of their jobs in two months -- have been unusually somber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of the leaders Mr. Obama has met with have grown wistful. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, not known for emotional frankness, seemed genuinely moved when she said Wednesday that ''taking leave from my partner and friend, well, yes, it is hard.'' And on Saturday, President Xi Jinping of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> commended Mr. Obama for his intensive focus on their relationship, noting that the two had met nine times, including three times in 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia betrayed no obvious regret when he met with Mr. Obama for a few minutes on the sidelines of the summit meeting here. Mr. Obama has blamed Russia for deepening the humanitarian crisis in Syria and accused it of meddling in the United States election by hacking into the emails of the Democratic National Committee. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, meanwhile, has praised Mr. Putin and has openly called for improving ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin looked grim in their brief chat, which Mr. Obama said was ''candid and courteous.'' He said he had asked Mr. Putin if they could end the slaughter in Syria or complete an agreement in Ukraine before Mr. Obama left office. At its end, Mr. Obama said, ''O.K.,'' before a brief and probably final handshake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Obama ranked the problems resulting from alleged Russian hacking far below those generated by fake news being circulated on social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The concern I had has less to do with any particular misinformation or propaganda that's put out by any particular party, but a greater concern about the general misinformation from all kinds of sources, domestic, foreign, on social media, that make it very difficult for voters to figure out what's true and what's not,'' Mr. Obama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If elections are ''full of fake news and false information and distractions, then the issue is not going to be what's happening on the outside,'' he added. ''The issue is going to be what are we going to be doing to ourselves from the inside.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The remarks followed similar comments at a news conference in Berlin on Thursday in which Mr. Obama was sharply critical of the role Facebook and other social media companies play in spreading false news -- a remarkable change in tone for a man who has spent so much of his presidency praising the transformational and beneficial effects of social media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, published a detailed post early Saturday describing ways the company was considering dealing with the problem of fake news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his news conference on Sunday, Mr. Obama suggested, for the first time, that he would continue to be active politically when his presidency ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said that at first, he would ''get some rest, spend time with my girls, and do some writing, do some thinking.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But he added that he reserved the right to speak out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislation issue but go to core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think it's necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I'll examine it when it comes,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then he said, to laughter, ''But what I do know is that I have to take Michelle on vacation.''</SPAN></P>
