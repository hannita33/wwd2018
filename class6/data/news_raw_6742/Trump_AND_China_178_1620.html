<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEXICO CITY -- There was dismay in Britain, applause in Russia and silence in Japan. French populists found hope, Mexican leaders expressed concern and Germany's vice chancellor offered an allusion to his country's dark past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his first speech as president of the United States, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> showed the world he could be as divisive abroad as he is at home. His vow to place America first -- and his threat to upend longstanding alliances, trade deals and many other tenets of the liberal democratic order the nation has chosen for nearly 70 years -- was received across the globe with fear, silence and glee, sometimes within the same country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In searching for a historical analogy, some in Britain reached back to the 1930s, when a bleaker vision of the world prevailed with America on the sidelines. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> imposed unusually tight state control over coverage of the inaugural, though state media highlighted ''violent'' protests in the United States. In the Philippines, nationalists set fire to an effigy of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, while the country's president welcomed his American counterpart's apparent willingness to stop telling other leaders how to govern.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Britain, Prime Minister Theresa May said she would tell a skeptical Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> how important NATO and the European Union are for European and world stability. ''With the threats we face, it's not the time for less cooperation,'' Mrs. May, who is supposed to travel to Washington soon, told The Financial Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nationalist movements embraced Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> words as a validation. The far-right French politician Marine Le Pen, a serious candidate in presidential elections this spring, declared that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory had opened ''a new era in the cooperation between nations.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mixed reaction reflected the global uncertainty about what a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency would look like -- and the divided world into which he steps. A fractured landscape of self-interest -- whether from rising nationalist movements in many European countries, an emboldened Russia or longstanding allies such as Britain or Japan -- underscored the confused, and often contradictory, responses. He is, in some ways, a Rorschach test for a polarized world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Time to buckle your seatbelts and cross your fingers,'' said Marcos Troyjo, a Brazilian economist and diplomat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For those hoping the president would sound different from the candidate, there was little comfort in his address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Germany, Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel warned of a ''drastic radicalization'' in American politics and said Berlin stood ready to fill the void left by an isolationist Washington. The only thing missing was a denunciation of Parliament as a ''gossip chamber,'' he added, using a term that fascists applied to German institutions in the 1920s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany would approach relations with Washington through the traditional channels of existing international agreements, including the Group of 20, which Germany will host this year. ''Even when there are differing opinions, possibilities and compromise are always best found through respectful exchange with one another,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For a world confronting a tide of populist rage, his words both soothed and frightened. President Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande of France, battling nationalist currents in his own country, did not even wait for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to give his address before offering his take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are in an open world economy, and it is not possible nor advisable to want to be isolated from the world economy,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Mexico, which Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has made a whipping boy for the false promise of trade and the threat of migration, the response from President Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto, who plans to deliver his own address on foreign policy on Monday, was almost immediate. On Twitter, after a congratulatory note, he wrote: ''Sovereignty, national interest and the protection of Mexicans will guide our relationship with the new government of the United States.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And an influential member of the president's governing party, Manlio Fabio Beltrones, warned in a speech after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inaugural Address that ''a weak and offended neighbor is not a good ally.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet the response was not all bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There were the usual gestures of cooperation, mixed with hope that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> angry and nationalistic words would not mean an American retreat from global responsibility. There was also joy, whether among nationalist parties or global powers long at odds with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Russia, where often vicious mockery of Barack Obama has for months been a state-sponsored national sport, responded with glee to Mr. Obama's departure from office and the arrival of President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The inauguration received blanket coverage on state media, with Rossiya 24, a round-the-clock television news channel, broadcasting the entire ceremony and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> address live, along with scenes of anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demonstrators smashing shop windows in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stirring particular delight among Russian politicians and commentators were Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remarks in his inaugural address about the need ''to unite the civilized world against radical Islam.'' One of Russia's biggest gripes against Mr. Obama was that he criticized President Vladimir V. Putin for supporting the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, a position that Moscow presented as tantamount to supporting terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In France, Ms. Le Pen, the National Front leader, lauded the British vote to leave the European Union and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory. ''In 2016, the Anglo-Saxon world woke up,'' she said. ''In 2017, I am sure it will be the year of peoples across the continent rising up!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Le Pen was to join other far-right leaders from Germany, Italy and the Netherlands in the German city of Koblenz on Saturday, just a day after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inauguration, at a conference to consult and celebrate what they consider a popular shift in their direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And in saying nothing, some world leaders seemed to embrace the new reality, seeking to accommodate a galvanizing political force whose message has been echoed in mass movements across continents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, who was the first world leader to meet with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after his election in November, said nothing publicly after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> speech. But in a congratulatory message to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> after the inauguration, the Japanese news media reported, he called Japan's alliance with the United States an ''axis of Japan's foreign and security policies,'' even though Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was vocal as a candidate in attacking Japanese trade practices and questioning American military support for the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which also offered no public response, the silence was notable for another reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It appeared to have been codified in an explicit directive. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Digital Times, an American-based website that tracks Chinese media and reports regularly on leaked orders from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> propaganda apparatus, published a directive that forbade the country's online news organizations to run photographs of the inauguration or to include it among their top five news stories of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Notwithstanding a few aberrations, the words of analysts were less muted, freed from the constraints of political niceties and the obligation of world leaders to work with the new American president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Japan, Goro Hashimoto, a special editor at the right-leaning Yomiuri Shimbun, the world's largest-circulation newspaper, compared Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> speech to President John F. Kennedy's inaugural address -- and not favorably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''When I heard Kennedy's speech when I was a child, I was so excited,'' he said. ''He talked about American values as well as the benefits for the world. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> didn't talk in that way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zhang Zhe, a Chinese student who is pursuing a doctorate in political science at Brown University in Rhode Island, watched Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inauguration with his parents. The picture Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presented of ''American carnage,'' he said in an email, did not register with the family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''My parents have only been in America for a few months and they don't know much about it, but even they could not bear what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said,'' Mr. Zhang wrote. ''My father asked me, 'This president, why does he describe the United States as a society that is worse off than </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> old feudal society?'''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The shift in policy left some determined to forge a path without the United States as the leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We can't sit around &amp; hope for US support &amp; cooperation,'' the former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt wrote on Twitter. ''Europe must take its destiny &amp; security in its own hands.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, amid the hand-wringing of establishment voices worried about a return to a less globalized world, there was a silver lining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The upside today is that the demagogues of the 1930s did not have to stand for re-election,'' wrote Josef Joffe, the publisher and editor of Die Zeit, the German weekly, wrote in The Guardian.</SPAN></P>
