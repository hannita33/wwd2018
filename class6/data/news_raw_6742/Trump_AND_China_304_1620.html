Among the political experts I speak to, the debate is between those who are betting on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and those who think that someone else (usually Rubio) still has a strong chance. The betting markets on the eve of the debate showed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a 74 percent chance of becoming the Republican nominee, and Rubio with a 24 percent chance. Of course Ben Carson and John Kasich are also part of the debate, but the focus is on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Cruz and Rubio as the front-runners. Here's my play-by-play from the debate, in the form not of a column but simply an assortment of my tweets during the debate. It's journalism on the fly - and here goes!</SPAN></P>
