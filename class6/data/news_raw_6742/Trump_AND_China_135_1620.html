<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> released a plan last month outlining thepriorities for his administration, many of which were repeated at most of hiscampaign rallies and events. He can accomplish some of his promises entirelyon his own, but others require Congress or pose other significant obstacles.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be able to use his authority to reverse executive actions taken by President Obama. He will also have significant latitude to carry out new immigration policies, though they would require an ambitious bureaucratic effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in almost all speeches.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Suspend immigration from ''terror-prone regions''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> controversial call to ban all Muslims from the United States seems to have evolved into a promise to bar people from certain regions rather than religions. He will have the power to carry out this plan, but it would make sweeping use of executive authority and require an ambitious bureaucratic effort not likely to move as quickly as he envisions. MORE &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in almost all speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  End foreign trade abuses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says he will direct his commerce secretary and trade representative on Day 1 to identify and end alleged abuses. The White House has plenty of leeway to penalize other nations it accuses of undercutting American manufacturers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in most speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Choose Supreme Courtnominee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has released a list of 21 possible candidates vetted by conservative legal groups to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The nominee will then be subject to approval by the Senate. MORE &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in about half of speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Leave the Trans-Pacific Partnership</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since the deal was never approved by Congress, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will not have to do anything to get out of the pact. MORE &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in about half of speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Label </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a currency manipulator</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has repeatedly accused </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of keeping its currency artificially cheap, though many economists believe the renminbi is overvalued, not undervalued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in about half of speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Limit federal regulations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promised to eliminate two existing federal regulations for every new one. The executive branch has the power to undo regulations through the same lengthy bureaucratic process that is used when they are created. MORE &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in a few speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Roll back environmentalregulations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could undo the Obama administration's environmental rules through the same lengthy bureaucratic process that was used when they were created. (In some cases, Congress could also vote to undo them.) He has also vowed to ''cancel'' last year's Paris climate agreement. The United States remains legally bound to the plan for four years, but there would be no legal consequences or economic sanctions if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not follow through with the commitment to limit carbon emissions.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in a few speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rescind Obama's actions on guns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 100-day plan says he will ''cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama.'' The gun actions are some that he frequently cited. MORE &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in a few speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Approve the Keystone XL pipeline</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he will lift ''Obama-Clinton roadblocks'' on energy infrastructure projects like the Keystone XL pipeline. He could grant the State Department the permit that the Obama administration has denied for the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in a few speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tighten lobbying restrictions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he will issue a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying for a foreign government and a ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for United States elections. His transition team has already asked administration appointees to sign a form agreeing to the policies. MORE &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in a few speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Freeze federal hiring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pledged to implement a hiring freeze on the federal workforce. Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan put freezes into effect during their presidencies, but a 1982 comptroller general report determined that the ''freezes have not been an effective means of controlling federal employment.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in a few speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Overturn protections for certain undocumented immigrants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The 100-day plan does not specifically cite the immigration actions, but Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he will overturn them. One Obama administration program protects immigrants who came to the United States as children. Another program, which was blocked by the courts, offered protection to a broader group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in a few speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cancel payments to U.N. climate programs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seems to be referring to money committed by the Obama administration to the Green Climate Fund, created to help poor countries control their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in a few speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Propose term limits on Congress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can propose an amendment to the Constitution, which would require a two-thirds majority in Congress to advance. But Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said the measure would not be on the agenda. MORE &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Might Need Congress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans may or may not need the help of Congress, depending on a variety of factors, including whether they would require new funding or a change in current laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in almost all speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Deport undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he will begin removing the two million to three million people he says fall into this category on his first day in office. But it may be difficult to carry out the deportations quickly without violating due process and without needing more money from Congress.MORE &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in almost all speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Renegotiate or withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would have to bring Mexico and Canada back to the table and get Congress to approve a new deal, but the United States can withdraw from the treaty six months after giving written notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in almost all speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Impose tariffs on companies moving overseas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Constitution bans the imposition of tariffs specifically aimed at a single company. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has a lot of power under existing law to impose broader tariffs without getting approval from Congress, but it is possible he may want to do something that requires new legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in about half of speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stop funding ''sanctuary cities''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he will cancel federal funding to cities that have curtailed their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. But because Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not given a detailed proposal, it is unclear whether he would have the authority to do so without Congress. Several Democratic mayors of major American cities have said they will oppose his plan. MORE &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Needs Congress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will need to work with Congress to carry out some of his significant proposals, including repealing the Affordable Care Act and building a wall along the border with Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in almost all speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Repeal and replace Obamacare</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Congress is unlikely to be able to repeal the entire law without a supermajority of 60 votes in the Senate, but it can eliminate parts of the law with a simple majority. Last year it passed a bill that would have eliminated the law's Medicaid expansion, premium subsidies and the requirement that all Americans buy insurance, but Mr. Obama vetoed it. Experts say repealing just these select parts of the law could lead to market chaos, and an estimated 22 million Americans would lose coverage. MORE &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in almost all speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Build a wall</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he will work with Congress to pass a bill that finances the construction of a southern border wall ''with the full understanding'' that Mexico will reimburse the United States. (Mexico has said it will not pay for the wall.) If he is able to get Congress to fund the wall -- a big if -- Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would still have to overcome a myriad of environmental and legal hurdles in order to move forward. MORE &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in most speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  End Common Core</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he will work with Congress to introduce an education bill that will, in part, end Common Core. However, it is unclear how Congress would get rid of Common Core when the federal government did not create it. Governors and state boards of education developed and voluntarily adopted the standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in most speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pass a security bill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plan includes the elimination of defense spending caps, changes to veterans' health care and new screening procedures for immigration. Many of his defense priorities align with Republicans in Congress, but he is likely to face opposition from Democrats and from Republicans wary of increased spending and of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> views on national security. MORE &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in about half of speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cut taxes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Congressional Republicans are also eager to pass tax reform, and their proposals share a lot of common ground with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plan, which would significantly cut taxes on businesses and most types of income. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that the plan would cut revenues significantly. While Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> insists the cuts would be paid for through economic growth, there is not evidence from previous tax cuts that growth would increase at those levels.MORE &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in about half of speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pass an infrastructure bill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says his plan to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure projects over 10 years would be paid for through leveraging public-private partnerships and encouraging private investment through tax incentives. Infrastructure spending is a shared priority with congressional Democrats, who have said they believe they can work with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the issue. MORE &raquo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in about half of speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pass an ethics bill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 100-day plan does not give details on his ethics bill proposal, but includes an oft-repeated objective to ''drain the swamp'' of special interests in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in a few speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Restrict lobbying by former members of Congress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also called for a five-year ban on lobbying for former members of Congress and their staff, an increase from the current two-year ban for senators and a one-year ban for House members. Congress is unlikely to pass this measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in a few speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pass a child care bill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposal includes allowing child care and elder care tax deductions, incentives for employers to provide on-site childcare, and tax-free savings accounts with matching contributions for low-income families. Democrats in Congress are also hoping to be able to work with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mentioned in a few speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pass a law enforcement bill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has proposed a bill that would create a new violent crimes task force and increase spending on resources for law enforcement and federal prosecutors. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would need to galvanize support from a Congress in which many lawmakers believe that the tough-on-crime policies of the 1990s were counterproductive.</SPAN></P>
