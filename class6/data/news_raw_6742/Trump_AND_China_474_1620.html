<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following is a transcript of the remarks by Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on immigration in Phoenix on Wednesday, as transcribed by the Federal News Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">TRUMP</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: Wow. Thank you. That's a lot of people, Phoenix, that's a lot of people. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thank you very much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The state that has a very, very special place in my heart. I love people of Arizona and together we are going to win the White House in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, you know this is where it all began for me. Remember that massive crowd also? So, I said let's go and have some fun tonight. We're going to Arizona, O.K.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This will be a little bit different. This won't be a rally speech, per se. Instead, I'm going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I've just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the president of Mexico, a man I like and respect very much. And a man who truly loves his country, Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And, by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns, and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the leadership and friendship between Mexico and the United States. It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile. And, in the end we're all going to win. Both countries, we're all going to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations. And in a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration we're going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries, but it's going to be a fair relationship. We want fairness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly. Sadly, sadly there is no other way. The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them. The politicians won't talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That's the way it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Today, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians. It's all you can do. Thank you. Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Let me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you the American people. Doesn't serve you. When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, lower wages. Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thank you. But if we're going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and it's impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it's just not going to work out. It's our right, as a sovereign nation, to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then there is the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced. I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders. So many people, so many, many people. So sad. They will be joining me on this stage in a little while and I look forward to introducing, these are amazing, amazing people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process, called Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody and then was released into the U.S., think of it, into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weak, weak policies. Weak and foolish policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large. Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top student in her class one day before her death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open-border policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa, Arizona. A lot of you have known about Grant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary, who had also been released from federal custody, and they knew it was going to happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another victim is Kate Steinle. Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an illegal immigrant, deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home, 90 years old and defenseless. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long, who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal. And they knew it was going to happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, a great woman, according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never, ever deported, despite the fact that everybody wanted him out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, in our prisons and jails together, had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names, 25,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. And this is what we get. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And they're hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But these facts are never reported. Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing, the needs of people living here illegally. In many cases, by the way, they're treated better than our vets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not going to happen anymore, folks. November 8th. Not going to happen anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AUDIENCE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump! Trump! Trump!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be -- and honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be three million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Frankly our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But whatever the number, that's never really been the central issue. It will never be a central issue. It doesn't matter from that standpoint. Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Only the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing America -- you know this, this is what they talk about, facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. And, they also think the biggest thing, and you know this, it's not nuclear, and it's not ISIS, it's not Russia, it's not </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> it's global warming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To all the politicians, donors, and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well being of the American people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nothing even comes a close second. Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated, but she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  No, she's only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity. So important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We will be fair, just, and compassionate to all, but our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona. You know it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Obama and Hillary Clinton support sanctuary cities. They support catch and release on the border. They support visa overstays. They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, criminals from detention. And they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On top of that she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country. Our citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where they come from. I always say Trojan horse. Watch what's going to happen, folks. It's not going to be pretty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time. And even yesterday, when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria. What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders if we can call them that. What the hell are we doing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hard to believe. Hard to believe. Now that you've heard about Hillary Clinton's plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan. And do you notice...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And do you notice all the time for weeks and weeks of debating my plan, debating, talking about it, what about this, what about that. They never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesn't want to get into the quagmire. It's a tough one, she doesn't know what she's doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from Federal Immigration offices, very great people. Among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country, who represent workers, not corporations, very important to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I also worked with lawmakers, who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years. And most importantly I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies. So important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Number one, are you ready? Are you ready?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We will build a great wall along the southern border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AUDIENCE: Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Mexico will pay for the wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One hundred percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it. And they're great people and great leaders but they're going to pay for the wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We will use the best technology, including above and below ground sensors that's the tunnels. Remember that, above and below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Above and below ground sensors. Towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and Mexico you know that, will work with us. I really believe it. Mexico will work with us. I absolutely believe it. And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today. I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I'm sure they will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Number two, we are going to end catch and release. We catch them, oh go ahead. We catch them, go ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Under my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And they'll be brought great distances. We're not dropping them right across. They learned that. President Eisenhower. They'd drop them across, right across, and they'd come back. And across.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end. We will take them great distances. But we will take them to the country where they came from, O.K.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Number three. Number three, this is the one, I think it's so great. It's hard to believe, people don't even talk about it. Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Zero. Zero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Zero. They don't come in here. They don't come in here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to federal data, there are at least two million, two million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, two million people criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect -- say hello to the police. Boy, they don't get the credit they deserve. I can tell you. They're great people. But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can't do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn't like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They're gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beyond the two million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled, but their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They're going to be gone. It will be over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They're going out. They're going out fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moving forward. We will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We will terminate the Obama administration's deadly, and it is deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do, crime all over the place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's over. That's over, folks. That's over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  My plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately. We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction. There's no common sense, there's no brain power in our administration by our leader, or our leaders. None, none, none.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On my first day in office I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ... to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. Strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And then we get them out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another reform I'm proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed. And they will go face, believe me. They're going to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We're going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Within ICE I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, O.K.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Maybe they'll be able to deport her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The local police who know every one of these criminals, and they know each and every one by name, by crime, where they live, they will work so fast. And our local police will be so happy that they don't have to be abused by these thugs anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There's no great mystery to it, they've put up with it for years, and now finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Who gave me their endorsement, 16,500 gave me their endorsement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And put more of them on the border instead of behind desks which is good. We will expand the number of border patrol stations significantly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. What they do is incredible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And getting their endorsement means so much to me. More to me really than I can say. Means so much. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Number four, block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities. Number five, cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately five million illegal immigrants, five million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (BOOING)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And how about all the millions that are waiting on line, going through the process legally? So unfair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs, including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the United States Supreme Court. Great.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty. And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country, a disaster in so many other ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And don't forget the Supreme Court of the United States. Don't forget that when you go to vote on November 8. And don't forget your Second Amendment. And don't forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And don't forget building up our depleted military. And don't forget taking care of our vets. Don't forget our vets. They have been forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton's plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. And you see what bad judgment she has. She has seriously bad judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (BOOING)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Can you imagine? In a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration all immigration laws will be enforced, will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges. That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under this current corrupt administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Number six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to data provided by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, and the national interest between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. And even right now the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that we've ever had in the history of our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Our country is a mess. We don't even know what to look for anymore, folks. Our country has to straighten out. And we have to straighten out fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The number is likely higher. But the administration refuses to provide this information, even to Congress. As soon as I enter office I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by Hillary Clinton, brutalized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (BOOING)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I call it extreme vetting right? Extreme vetting. I want extreme. It's going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in that's fine but they're going to be good. It's extreme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And if people don't like it, we've got have a country folks. Got to have a country. Countries in which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria. We have no idea who they are, where they come from. There's no documentation. There's no paperwork. It's going to end badly folks. It's going to end very, very badly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For the price of resettling one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region. Which I agree with 100 percent. We have to build safe zones and we'll get the money from Gulf states. We don't want to put up the money. We owe almost $20 trillion. Doubled since Obama took office, our national debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But we will get the money from Gulf states and others. We'll supervise it. We'll build safe zones which is something that I think all of us want to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include, and this is so important, especially if you get the right people. And we will get the right people. An ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thank you. We're very proud of our country. Aren't we? Really? With all it's going through, we're very proud of our country. For instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan. And these two countries according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified. That's what they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's what they say. They're justified. Right? And we're admitting them to our country. Applicants will be asked their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities. Attitudes on radical Islam, which our president refuses to say and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure. And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very, very few will slip through the cracks. Hopefully, none.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Number seven, we will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they've been ordered to leave the United States. Including large numbers of violent criminals, they won't take them back. So we say, O.K., we'll keep them. Not going to happen with me, not going to happen with me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And by the way, the results are horrific, horrific. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet despite the existence of a law that commands the secretary of state to stop issuing visas to these countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. And, they would comply if we would act properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In other words, if we had leaders that knew what they were doing, which we don't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries. Instead we have them all over the place. Probably a couple in this room as a matter of fact, but I hope not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to a report for the Boston Globe from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not, under any circumstances, take them back. Hard to believe with the power we have. Hard to believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We're like the big bully that keeps getting beat up. You ever see that? The big bully that keeps getting beat up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch. She had the power and the duty to stop it cold, and she decided she would not do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (BOOING)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Arizona knows better than most exactly what I'm talking about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assaults, and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder, and child molestation. We take them, we take them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (BOOING)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Number eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which we need desperately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For years Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action, never happens. Never happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hillary Clinton, all talk. Unfortunately when there is action it's always the wrong decision. You ever notice?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In my administration we will ensure that this system is in place. And, I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. We will have a proper tracking system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left. Why should they? Nobody's telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want, we'll take care of you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays pose -- and they really are a big problem -- pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system should be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the United States on expired visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant. Wouldn't that have been wonderful, right? What that could have meant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last year alone nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing these overstays will be a top priority of my administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never, ever leave, the Obama-Clinton policy, that's what it is, then we have a completely open border, and we no longer have a country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Number nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and we will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Immigration law doesn't exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out. It exists to protect all aspects of American life. The work site, the welfare office, the education system, and everything else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforced the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world. We will enforce all of our immigration laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And the same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tremendous costs, by the way, to our country. Tremendous costs. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the United States Treasury. Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Number 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people. Workers. We're going to take care of our workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And by the way, and by the way, we're going to make great trade deals. We're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to bring our jobs back home. We're going to bring our jobs back home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world, and that starts with Nafta. And now they want to go TPP, one of the great disasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We're going to bring our jobs back home. And if companies want to leave Arizona and if they want to leave other states, there's going to be a lot of trouble for them. It's not going to be so easy. There will be consequence. Remember that. There will be consequence. They're not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it into the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment. It's not going to happen. There will be consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015. Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. So true. But we now have an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration as we are following, if you think, previous immigration waves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We've had some big waves. And tremendously positive things have happened. Incredible things have happened. To ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works. Assimilation, an important word. Integration and upward mobility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Within just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records. The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms. To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society and their ability to be financially self- sufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We take anybody. Come on in, anybody. Just come on in. Not anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You know, folks, it's called a two-way street. It is a two-way street, right? We need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others. Remember, under a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration it's called America first. Remember that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To choose immigrants based on merit. Merit, skill, and proficiency. Doesn't that sound nice? And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. And that in particular African-American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African-American worker, the Latino worker. She's going to do nothing. Give me your vote, she says, on November 8th. And then she'll say, so long, see you in four years. That's what it is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She is going to do nothing. And just look at the past. She's done nothing. She's been there for 35 years. She's done nothing. And I say what do you have to lose? Choose me. Watch how good we're going to do together. Watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You watch. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest. We've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. They're decades and decades old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date. They're archaic. They're ancient. We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on auto pilot for decades, so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So let's now talk about the big picture. These 10 steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years. It's going to happen, folks. Because I am proudly not a politician, because I am not behold to any special interest, I've spent a lot of money on my campaign, I'll tell you. I write those checks. Nobody owns </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I will get this done for you and for your family. We'll do it right. You'll be proud of our country again. We'll do it right. We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above. And, when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down. Border crossings will plummet. Gangs will disappear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And the gangs are all over the place. And welfare use will decrease. We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities. We're going to rebuild them, for once and for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only. To return home and apply for reentry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Thank you. Thank you. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system -- and it will be an efficient system -- will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">TRUMP</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. We will break the cycle. There will be no amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Our message to the world will be this. You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country. Can't do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays, very importantly. People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized. It's not going to work that way. Those days are over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Importantly, in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time. And at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And the establishment of our new lawful immigration system then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Right now, however, we're in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before. All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time, immigration security. Cut it off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing. And the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These are matters of life and death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton. And do you notice, she doesn't answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She didn't go to Louisiana. She didn't go to Mexico. She was invited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She doesn't have the strength or the stamina to make America great again. Believe me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What we do know, despite the lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. Just ask the Border Patrol about Hillary Clinton. You won't like what you're hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The result will be millions more illegal immigrants; thousands of more violent, horrible crimes; and total chaos and lawlessness. That's what's going to happen, as sure as you're standing there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This election, and I believe this, is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration and reform our laws to make your life better. I really believe this is it. This is our last time. November 8. November 8. You got to get out and vote on November 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's our last chance. It's our last chance. And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment. Remember that. So I want to remind everyone what we're fighting for and who we are fighting for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I am going to ask -- these are really special people that I've gotten to know. I'm going to ask all of the ''Angel Moms'' to come join me on the stage right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These are amazing women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These are amazing people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I've become friends with so many. But Jamiel Shaw, incredible guy, lost his son so violently. Say just a few words about your child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (SPEAKER'S VOICE): My son Ronald da Silva (ph) was murdered April 27, 2002 by an illegal alien who had been previously deported. And what so -- makes me so outrageous is that we came here legally.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (SPEAKER'S VOICE): Laura Wilkerson. And my son was Joshua Wilkerson. He was murdered by an illegal in 2010. And I personally support Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for our next president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (SPEAKER'S VOICE): My name is Ruth Johnston Martin (ph). My husband was shot by an illegal alien. He fought the good fight but he took his last breath in 2002. And I support this man who's going to change this country for the better. God bless you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (SPEAKER'S VOICE): My name Maureen Maloney (ph), and our son Matthew Denise (ph) was 23 years old when he was dragged a quarter of a mile to his death by an illegal alien, while horrified witnesses were banging on the truck trying to stop him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (APPLAUSE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (SPEAKER'S VOICE): Our son Matthew Denise, if Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were president in 2011, our son Matthew Denise and other Americans would be alive today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (SPEAKER'S VOICE): Thank you. My name is Kathy Woods (ph). My son Steve (ph), a high school senior, 17 years old, went to the beach after a high school football game. A local gang came along, nine members. The cars were battered to -- like war in Beirut. And all I can say is they murdered him and if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had been in office then the border would have been secure and our children would not be dead today.</SPAN></P>
