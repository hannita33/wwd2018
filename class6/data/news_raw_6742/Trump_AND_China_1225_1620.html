</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SUIT OVER HATE MAIL EMBROILS MARVEL CHIEF   |  Isaac Perlmutter, the enigmatic billionaire chief executive of Marvel Entertainment, has become embroiled in a legal soap opera that has been playing out in Palm Beach and New York courts, </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Sloans Curve community, where Mr. Perlmutter lives, the tennis program is run by Karen D. Donnelly - a favorite of Mr. Perlmutter, who is an avid tennis player. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Harold Peerenboom, a Toronto businessman who founded a successful executive search firm, moved into the community in 2007, he learned that Ms. Donnelly worked without a contract and had not bid for the work. Mr. Peerenboom claimed that amounted to bid-rigging under Florida law and made his objection known to the homeowners' organization. The board, nudged by Mr. Perlmutter, overruled Mr. Peerenboom and reworked the agreement so that Ms. Donnelly did not have to submit a competitive bid to run the tennis complex. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Donnelly then filed a lawsuit against Mr. Peerenboom, paid for by Mr. Perlmutter, contending that she had been slandered. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Peerenboom says he was then subject to a hate-letter writing campaign. His neighbors and business associates received letters claiming that Mr. Peerenboom was a child molester and that he killed a couple who were found dead of asphyxiation. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Peerenboom has never been accused of these crimes and is now trying to compel Marvel to produce Mr. Perlmutter's emails. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case has become an example of the strange and high stakes private legal battles that executives at public companies become involved in. They do not always become public, but they do raise questions about corporate governance. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much responsibility does a public company have to investigate a controversial private matter involving a senior executive? At what point should an executive be suspended? Should a private legal matter have any bearing on an executive's work? </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very subjective,&quot; said Charles M. Elson, a professor of finance and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. &quot;That's why you have a board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VISIUM HEDGE FUND UNDER INVESTIGATION  |  Visium Asset Management is being investigated by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alexandra Stevenson reports in DealBook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund told investors that the agencies had requested information from several years ago relating to the valuation of securities in a credit fund that Visium shut in 2013. The authorities are also looking at Visium's trading of certain securities and its use of a consultant more than five years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to investors, the chief investment officer, Jacob Gottlieb, said that Visium was cooperating with the government. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear from the letter how serious the investigation is and whether any charges will be filed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One institution that had invested in the credit fund said it was recently questioned by S.E.C. investigators, according to The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the inquiry. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visium manages $8 billion of investor money and has long focused on investments in health care. It was one of the hedge funds invested in Valeant Pharmaceuticals last year, but sold the last of its shares in the fourth quarter of 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ON THE AGENDA  |  European Union finance ministers meet to discuss an agreement on a law to help curb corporate tax avoidance. A news conference will follow at 6:30 a.m. Chevron's security analyst meeting starts at 8:30 a.m. Stephen Luparello, director of trading and markets division at the Securities and Exchange Commission, will speak on regulatory issues at the International Bankers' Annual Washington Conference at 9 a.m.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WELLS FARGO CHARGED WITH FRAUD  |  Wells Fargo has been accused of fraud of its role in underwriting a $75 million municipal bond deal for a video game company in Rhode Island that went bankrupt and left taxpayers on the hook for the debt, </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Corkery reports in DealBook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Wells Fargo and the state agency that issued the bonds with failing to disclose to investors the company's true financial picture. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state agency had agreed to borrow the money in the tax-exempt municipal market and lend the proceeds to 38 Studios, the now defunct video game start-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State officials had hoped to stimulate jobs and lure other businesses to Rhode Island by lending to 38 Studios, but neither the state agency nor Wells Fargo disclosed in the bond offering documents that 38 Studios faced a funding shortfall even after it had received the bond proceeds. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unable to pay off the debt, 38 Studios declared bankruptcy, leaving Rhode Island taxpayers with the bill. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The S.E.C. said that Wells Fargo also cut a &quot;side deal&quot; with 38 Studios, which agreed to pay the bank an additional $400,000 if the bond deal closed, enabling the bank to receive twice as much money from the deal as was detailed in the offering documents. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The S.E.C. said that the bank failed to inform potential bond investors of the full extent of its economic interests. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An underwriter's 'skin in the game' is material information to investors,&quot;  said LeeAnn Ghazil Gaunt, the head of the S.E.C. enforcement division's municipal securities and public pensions unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the bank disputed the S.E.C.'s accusations.  </SPAN></P>
