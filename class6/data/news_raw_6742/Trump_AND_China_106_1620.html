</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING - The Chinese Navy on Tuesday handed back an American underwater drone it had seized, returning the device to the United States after days of contention that drew the ire of President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Chinese vessel returned the submersible drone to a United States Navy ship in international waters off the Philippines, near where it was taken on Thursday, a spokesman for the Department of Defense, Peter Cook, said on the Pentagon's website.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the Pentagon disclosed the episode on Friday and demanded the return of the ocean-monitoring device, American and Chinese officials have engaged in verbal sniping over the legality of the seizure, which took place roughly 500 miles from the coast of mainland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. In the latest announcement, Mr. Cook pressed home the official American position.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The incident was inconsistent with both international law and standards of professionalism for conduct between navies at sea,&quot; Mr. Cook said. He did not mention what condition the drone was in when it was returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has recently irked Beijing with a string of blunt comments on controversial issues including Taiwan, trade and North Korea's nuclear weapons, also took up the dispute over the drone, which is also called an unmanned underwater vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But unlike the Pentagon, he suggested that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could keep it. On Saturday, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said on Twitter that the seizure was an unprecedented act, and he later added, &quot;We should tell </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that we don't want the drone they stole back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opaque policy making, especially on military issues, has left outsiders guessing about who authorized the seizure, whether the act was meant to send a message and, if so, whether that message was aimed at Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But the way in which the Chinese ship fished out the drone with a United States Navy ship nearby suggested a calibrated action, several analysts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has drawn particular ire from Beijing for suggesting he could depart from the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> principle, which blocks Washington from diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The Chinese government insists that it has a sovereign right to Taiwan, which has its own democratically elected government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see the snatched drone as a calculated act of coercive diplomacy approved at the top,&quot; Patrick M. Cronin, the senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, said in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe Beijing accelerated plans to create an early test for the new administration because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> publicly called into question the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy and because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> judged it safer to provoke Obama than an unpredictable </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; Mr. Cronin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement by Mr. Cook, the Pentagon spokesman, made clear that the episode would not shake American determination to maintain a military presence in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, where busy shipping lanes intersect with volatile rivalries over territorial claims. He said the United States would &quot;continue to fly, sail and operate in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea wherever international law allows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Obama administration says the United States does not take sides in the territorial disputes but wants to preserve freedom of navigation in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, including for United States Navy ships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rapidbuildup of naval and coast guard forces in the region, and its construction of military facilities on artificially created islands, has alarmed Southeast Asian nations that also claim islands in the sea. The Chinese government says the American presence there is provocative, and it has said so again since the drone was seized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> firmly opposes the frequent appearance of U.S. military aircraft and vessels in waters facing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for close-in reconnaissance and military surveys,&quot; Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters in Beijing on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When reporters pressed Ms. Hua on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reasoning, she asked, &quot;Are you implying that the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea is in the pocket of the United States?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a brief online statement on Tuesday from the Chinese Ministry of National Defense did not mention tensions over the United States presence, merely confirming that it had &quot;smoothly completed&quot; the return of the drone after &quot;friendly consultations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese officials have said that their military had a right to pull the drone from the sea more than 50 miles northwest of Subic Bay in the Philippines. They said the Chinese ship had done so out of safety concerns for passing vessels. Many foreign experts in international law have scoffed at that explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the dispute prompted an outburst of condemnation toward American policy from hawkish Chinese commentators. Chinese nationalist ire could grow if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continues challenging Beijing, especially on Taiwan and the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a commentary published Monday, Fan Jinfa, a commodore with the Chinese Navy, said the seized drone was part of an American effort to map and monitor conditions in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea to improve tracking of Chinese submarines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The undersea battleground, especially in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, will become a new domain of Chinese-American rivalry,&quot; Commodore Fan wrote in the commentary published on the website of People's Daily, a newspaper. He said of the drone dispute: &quot;The malign intent of the Americans in unilaterally and publicly stirring this up was glaringly clear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
