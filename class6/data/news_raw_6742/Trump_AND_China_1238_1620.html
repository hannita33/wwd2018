</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SHALE BARON IS CHARGED IN RIGGING OF LEASES  |  The Justice Department charged Aubrey K. McClendon, an Oklahoma wildcatter, with conspiring to suppress the prices paid for oil and natural gas leases, </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clifford Krauss reports in The New York Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McClendon is accused of orchestrating a conspiracy in which two oil and gas companies colluded not to bid against each other for the purchase of leases in northwestern Oklahoma from late 2007 to early 2012. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Justice Department said the companies decided who would win the leases and the winner would allot an interest in the leases to the other company. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land,&quot; said William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the antitrust division. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Mr. McClendon denied all charges and argued that he has worked to create jobs and help Oklahoma's economy while providing energy for the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The charge that has been filed against me today is wrong and unprecedented,&quot; he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. McClendon, an audacious chief executive at Chesapeake until he was forced to step down three years ago, became a billionaire as the company aggressively outbid competitors for land leases and drilled highly productive wells in virtually every major shale gas field in the country. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With him at the helm, Chesapeake and a handful of other companies helped turn the United States into an energy exporter  and pioneered hydraulic fracturing in newly explored shale fields. They ended up producing a glut of natural gas that sent them to the brink of bankruptcy as gas prices collapsed. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chesapeake's stock price has been sinking for five years now, especially since it was revealed that Mr. McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and used it as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans used mostly to pay for his share of the cost of drilling those wells. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gordon Pennoyer, a spokesman for Chesapeake, said the company was cooperating with the antitrust investigation and did not expect to face prosecution or fines related to the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TENURE VOTING COULD SHIFT POWER BALANCE  |  It is time to consider &quot;tenure voting,&quot; a system in which shareholders accumulate more votes the longer they hold stock,<BR>Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor column.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dual-class stock is all the rage - some 13.5 percent of initial public offerings included some type of dual-class structure, according to Dealogic. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This creates a culture of &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots,&quot; where a vote is worth everything or nothing. The founders control the company and wield influence more or less with impunity. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea can work well in principle, allowing the founders to look to the long term. And when one share counts for one vote, too often the vote doesn't count. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But neither model reflects an increasingly complicated reality. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In tenure voting, more votes are awarded for a longer holding period with the intention of empowering shareholders who stick with the company. The founders may still have a larger voting bloc, but long-term institutional investors would grow over time, allowing some measured shareholder activism. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are indications that shareholders value the power to vote too. Google's &quot;no vote&quot; shares, for example, trade at a small discount to its one-vote shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SABMILLER SELLS STAKE IN TOP BEER  |  A state-backed brewer agreed to buy out SABMiller's 49 percent stake in the maker of Snow, the world's best-selling beer,<BR>Chad Bray and Michael J. de la Merced report in DealBook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anheuser-Busch InBev is hoping the sale to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Resources Beer will help ease regulators' concerns about its nearly $104 billion merger with SABMiller. The deal values SABMiller's stake at about $1.6 billion and is one of several transactions being undertaken in order to appease regulators. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABMiller agreed to sell its stake in MillerCoors in the United States for about $12 billion in November. Asahi Group Holdings of Japan has also agreed to buy Peroni and Grolsch, as well as parts of SABMiller's European operations, for about $2.8 billion. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All these transactions are contingent on SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch Inbev completing their merger. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ON THE AGENDA  |  Exxon Mobil's analyst meeting starts at 9 a.m. The February ADP National Employment Report will be published at 8:15 a.m.  Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state, will be on Fox Business at 8:30 a.m. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Beige Book will be published at 2. p.m. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EVEN TRADERS ARE CONFUSED BY STOCK EXCHANGE PRICES  |  Computer-driven American stock markets have become so complex that at any moment in time more than 800 different pricing possibilities are being offered to trading firms across 12 official exchanges, according to a report by the Royal Bank of Canada,<BR>Nathaniel Popper writes in DealBook. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complexity is a result, in part, of the constant jockeying among exchanges to win business from the biggest traders, many of which are so-called high-frequency trading firms that make money by capitalizing on small changes in prices. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RBC Capital Markets, found that the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and other exchanges make frequent small tweaks to their prices, influencing trading behavior in ways that are hard for even sophisticated investors to understand. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some big mutual fund companies said that before seeing the research even they had not realized how convoluted the system had become. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one exchange highlighted in the research, EDGX, the pricing tiers, for example, include the &quot;Investor Tier,&quot; the &quot;Ultra Tier,&quot; the &quot;Mega-Step-Up Tier 1&quot; and the &quot;Mega-Step-Up Tier 2,&quot; among others. These tiers, though, were just the first layer of complication that big investors have to navigate to determine the price of buying or selling a stock. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the hundreds of pricing structures, the brokers actually buying and selling stocks can be given incentives to make decisions that are not in the best interest of clients. The opaque pricing structures can make it nearly impossible for investors and even brokers to determine what they will pay for a given trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research is likely to strengthen the hand of IEX, a company that is  asking regulators for approval to become an official stock exchange. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The founders of IEX were the protagonists in the Michael Lewis book &quot;Flash Boys&quot; and are hoping to provide a more straightforward way to trade stocks. One tool they are proposing is a speed bump to slow down trading.</SPAN></P>
