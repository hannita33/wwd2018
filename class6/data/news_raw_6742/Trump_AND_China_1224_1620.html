<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Here's what you need to know to start your day.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Electoral College meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's electors gather today to cast their ballots for president and vice president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is projected to win, but his loss of the popular vote to Hillary Clinton has renewed a focus on the event, as have the findings by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russian hackers worked to undermine Mrs. Clinton's campaign.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electors rarely go against a state's results. Their votes will be counted in Washington on Jan. 6. Here's what to expect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bipartisan call for hacking inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, have calledfor a select committee toinvestigate Russian cyberattacks aimed at influencing the presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> top advisers said on Sunday that the reports about the hacking lacked conclusive evidence. The president-elect has sought to discredit the intelligence agencies' findings, saying they were a partisan attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Escalating humanitarian crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to one million people are trapped in the Iraqi city of Mosul, running low on food and drinking water and facing the worsening cruelty of Islamic State fighters, our reporters said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Syria, the removal of residents from Aleppo and nearby villages proceeded tenuously after rebels set fire to several buses. The U.N. Security Council will vote today on sending monitors to observe the evacuation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This would give us collectively the tools to avoid another Srebrenica,&quot; France's ambassador to the U.N. said, referring to a massacre of civilians in Bosnia in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turmoil at the I.M.F.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christine Lagarde,the chief of the International Monetary Fund, was found guilty today of criminal charges tied to the misuse of public funds during her time as France's finance minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The surprise verdict won't result in jail time, the judge said, but it may force her from her post at the I.M.F.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S.-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> standoff ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beijing agreed to return an underwater drone that it had seized in international waters, the Pentagon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Allies and observers will find it hard not to conclude this represents another diminishment of American authority in the region,&quot; an international relations expert said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Company's slavery ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Alive, slaves were among a white man's most prized assets. Dead, they were considered virtually worthless. Life insurance changed that calculus,&quot; our reporter writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her article focuses on the policies New York Life sold in the 19th century to cover slaves, and how their descendants are coming to terms with that past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finland will try a bold experiment next year: givingcash tounemployedpeople, without conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roughly 2,000 residents without jobs will be picked at random to receive the money. The government is eager to see how they spend it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ireland will appeal the E.U.'sorder to collect a record $14 billion in taxes from Apple, arguing that the bloc overstepped its authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wall Street forecasters are delivering their market predictions for the coming year. Our columnist figured they had about a 50-50 chance of being correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, a statistician said, &quot;They are much worse than random chance alone would predict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. stocks finished down on Friday. Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A suicide   bomber disguised as a disabled man killed at least 48 people in Yemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Corpus Christi, Tex., lifted a four-day ban on its drinking water after tests showed no contamination from a chemical leak at an asphalt plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In memoriam: Dr. Henry J. Heimlich, 96, whose antichoking technique has been credited with saving 100,000 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zsa Zsa Gabor, 99, an actress who left an imprint on American celebrity with her own form of glamour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&quot; was No. 1 at the North American box office, collecting an estimated $155 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bringing the Paleolithic era to life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 50 years after the Lascaux caves in France were closed to the public, visitors can see reproductions of their prehistoric art. Our 360 video offers a glimpse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Robot cats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lifelike felines aren't the year's hottest holiday gift; they are being used to help patients with dementia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For a lot of our residents, it's a chance to be a caregiver, and to be in an active, empowered role again,&quot; a director of a nursing home said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An overdue parting. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1959, Barbara Roston of Brooklyn checked out &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; from a public library.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She returned the book this month, 57 years late. No late fee was charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recipe of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Try this four-ingredient roast chicken dish, which could become a weeknight favorite. While it cooks, watch an interview with our food critic Pete Wells, who shares some of the secrets of his trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's begin the week talking about holiday spirits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dried hibiscus flowers steeped with ginger mean it's Christmastime in Jamaica. Mulled wine with port and brandy make for a fine glogg in Scandinavia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christmas by the beach comes with coquito, a Puerto Rican rum-based cocktail. Recipes are like heirlooms for many families there, and flavors include chocolate and banana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flour derived from orchid bulbs binds sahlab, a creamy Middle Eastern beverage. In Lithuania, poppy milk, made from poppy seeds steeped in water and honey, is served on Christmas Eve as part of the Twelve Dishes feast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British tradition of wassailing in exchange for a bowl of hot mulled cider goes back centuries, as does eggnog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most historians agree that eggnog, a concoction of egg, milk and bourbon, originated in medievalEngland and eventually made its way to North America in the 1700s. A recipe from 1958 ran in The Times nine years ago, as the beverage was making a comeback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its popularity had dimmed by the end of the previous century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans appeared unwilling &quot;to sacrifice future well-being for the sake of a momentary gratification,&quot; a writer lamented, &quot;even though sanctioned by the precept and example of our ancestors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever your drink of choice is, sharing is the key ingredient. Happy holidays.</SPAN></P>
