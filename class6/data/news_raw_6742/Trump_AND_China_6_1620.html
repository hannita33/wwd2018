<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;In many of the president-elect's international development ventures, his business partners have close ties to foreign governments.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MANILA - On Thanksgiving Day, a Philippine developer namedJose E. B. Antonio hosted a company anniversary bash at one of Manila's poshest hotels. He had much to be thankful for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October, he had quietly been named a special envoy to the United States by the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte. Mr. Antonio was nearly finished building a $150 million tower in Manila's financial district - a 57-story symbol of affluence and capitalism, which bluntly promotes itself with the slogan &quot;Live Above the Rest.&quot; And now his partner on the project, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, had just been elected president of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the election, Mr. Antonio flew to New York for a private meeting at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower with the president-elect's children, who have been involved in the Manila project from the beginning, as have Mr. Antonio's children. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trumps</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Antonios have other ventures in the works, including </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-branded resorts in the Philippines, Mr. Antonio's son Robbie Antonio said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will continue to give you products that you can enjoy and be proud of,&quot; the elder Mr. Antonio, one of therichest men in the Philippines, told the 500 friends, employees and customers gathered for his star-studded celebration in Manila.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Antonio's combination of jobs - he is a business partner with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, while also representing the Philippines in its relationship with the United States and the president-elect - is hardly inconsequential, given some of the weighty issues on the diplomatic table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them, Mr. Duterte has urged &quot;a separation&quot; from the United States andhas called for American troops to exit the country in two years' time. His antidrug crusade has resulted inthe summary killings of thousands of suspected criminals without trial, prompting criticism from the Obama administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Situations like these are already leading some former government officials from both parties to ask if America's reaction to events around the world could potentially be shaded, if only slightly, by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family's financial ties with foreign players. They worry, too, that in some countries those connections could compromise American efforts to criticize the corrupt intermingling of state power with vast business enterprises controlled by the political elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is uncharted territory, really in the history of the republic, as we have never had a president with such an empire both in the United States and overseas,&quot; said Michael J. Green, who served on the National Security Council in the administration of George W. Bush, and before that at the Defense Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The globe is dotted with such potential conflicts. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> companies have business operations in at least 20 countries, with a particular focus on the developing world, including outposts in nations like India, Indonesia and Uruguay, according to a New York Times analysis of his presidential campaign financial disclosures. What's more, the true extent of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> global financial entanglements is unclear, since he has refused to release his tax returns and has not made public a list of his lenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In aninterview with The Times on Tuesday, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> boasted again about the global reach of his business - and his family's ability to keep it running after he takes office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've built a very great company and it's a big company and it's all over the world,&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, adding later: &quot;I don't care about my company. It doesn't matter. My kids run it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a written statement, his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his family were committed to addressing any issues related to his financial holdings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Vetting of various structures and immediate transfer of the business remains a top priority for both President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, his adult children and his executives,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a review by The Times of these business dealings identified a menu of the kinds of complications that could create a running source of controversy for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as well as tensions between his priorities as president and the needs and objectives of his companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Brazil, for example, the beachfront </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotel Rio de Janeiro - one of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> many branding deals, in which he does not have an equity stake - is part of a broad investigation by a federal prosecutor who is examining whether illicit commissions and bribes resulted in apparent favoritism by two pension funds that invested in the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> real estate ventures in India - where he has more projects underway than in any location outside North America - are being built through companies with family ties to India's most important political party. This makes it more likely that Indian government officials will do special favors benefiting Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> projects, including pressuring state-owned banks to extend favorable loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ireland and Scotland, executives from Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> golf courses have been waging two separate battles with local officials. The most recent centers on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization's plans to build a flood-prevention sea wall at the course on the Irish coast. Some environmentalists say the wall could destroy an endangered snail's habitat - a dispute that will soon involve the president of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in Turkey, officials including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a religiously conservative Muslim, demanded that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name be removed from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Towers in Istanbul after he called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. More recently, after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> came to the defense of Mr. Erdogan - suggesting that he had the right to crack down harshly on dissidents after a failed coup - the calls for action against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Towers have stopped, fueling worries that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policies toward Turkey might be shaped by his commercial interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has acknowledged a conflict of interest in Turkey. &quot;I have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul,&quot; he said during a radio interview last year with Stephen K. Bannon, the Breitbart News executive who has since been designated his chief White House strategist.&quot;It's a tremendously successful job. It's called </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Towers - two towers, instead of one. Not the usual one. It's two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These tangled ties already have some members of Congress - including at least one Republican representative - calling on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to provide more information on his international operations, or perhaps for a congressional inquiry into them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You rightly criticized Hillary for Clinton Foundation,&quot; Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, said in a Twitter message on Monday. &quot;If you have contracts w/foreign govts, it's certainly a big deal, too.#DrainTheSwamp&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David J. Kramer, who served as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor during the Bush administration, said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> financial entanglements could undermine decades of efforts by Democratic and Republican presidents to promote government transparency - and to use the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to stop contractors from paying bribes to secure government work abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will make it a little harder to be able to go out and proselytize around these things,&quot; Mr. Kramer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his family seek no special advantages from foreign governments, officials overseas may feel compelled to help the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family by, say, accelerating building permits or pushing more business to one of the new president's hotels or golf courses, according to several former State Department officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The working assumption on behalf of all these foreign government officials will be that there is an advantage to doing business with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> organization,&quot; said Michael H. Fuchs, who was until recently deputy assistant secretary at the bureau of East Asian and Pacific affairs. &quot;They will think it will ingratiate themselves with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration. And this will significantly complicate United States foreign policy and our relationships around the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Mr. Fuchs said, American diplomats in countries where Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> companies operate, fearful of a rebuke from Washington, may be reluctant to take steps that could frustrate business partners or political allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another question is, who will be responsible for security at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Towers around the world, especially in the Middle East, which terrorism experts say may now become more appealing targets as symbols of American capitalism built in the name of the president?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is clear is that there has been very little division, in the weeks since the election, between Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business interests and his transition effort, with the president-elect or his family greeting real estate partners from India and the Philippines in his office and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> raising concerns about his golf course in Scotland with a prominent British politician. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> daughterIvanka, who is in charge of planningand development of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization's global network of hotels, has joined in conversations with at least three world leaders - of Turkey, Argentina and Japan - having access that could help her expand the brand worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in the interview with The Times on Tuesday, acknowledged that his move to the Oval Office could help enrich his family. He cited his new hotel a few blocks from the White House, which the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization has urged diplomats to consider patronizing when in town to meet the president or his team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal law does not prevent Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from taking actions that could benefit him and his family financially; the president is exempt from most conflict-of-interest laws. But the Constitution, through what is called the emoluments clause, appears to prohibit him from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government entity, a standard that some legal experts say he may violate by renting space in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in New York to the Bank of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or if he hosts foreign diplomats in one of his hotels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be because, psychologically, occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was before, O.K.? The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I can't help that, but I don't care,&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, adding, &quot;The only thing that matters to me is running our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert D. Blackwill, a former National Security Council member who also served as ambassador to India during the Bush administration, said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> still had a chance to demonstrate that he could manage these challenges once he was sworn in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let's listen and not prejudge,&quot; said Mr. Blackwill, a Republican who was so critical of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that he endorsed Hillary Clinton. &quot;I want to see what he does as president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRAZIL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nation Under Pressure, Ventures Under Scrutiny</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jr., the president-elect's oldest son, gushed with triumphalism when he announced a deal in 2014 to attach the family name to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotel Rio de Janeiro, a lavish 171-room beachfront project featuringcavernous suites with private plunge pools and a 4,000-square-foot nightclub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an exciting time to develop our first project in South America and the perfect location to do so,&quot; the younger Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (his brother Eric is also involved in the family business) said at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But just two years later, the venture is embroiled in a criminal investigation in Brazil, pointing to unfulfilled promises that are casting a pall over both the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business empire and the president-elect in their dealings in Latin America's largest country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anselmo Henrique Cordeiro Lopes, a crusading federal prosecutor in the capital, Bras&iacute;lia, opened an investigation in the weeks before the American election into $40 million in investments made by two relatively small Brazilian pension funds in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotel Rio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hotel inquiry is looking at why the funds - Serpro, which invests on behalf of retirees of a state-controlled information technology firm, and Igeprev, which manages the pensions of public employees of the sparsely populated Tocantins State - put so much of their capital into the venture, which is owned by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brazilian partner, LSH Barra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in 2014, the hotel might have seemed like a good deal. Brazil was about to host the World Cup soccer tournament that year, while Rio was preparing to be the venue for the 2016 Summer Olympics. At the same time, Rio, the nerve center of Brazil's energy industry, had been bolstered by large offshore oil discoveries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Brazil's economy began to weaken in 2014, undermined by falling commodities prices, colossal graft scandals and political instability that culminated in the ouster this year of President Dilma Rousseff, who was replaced by her vice president, Michel Temer. The result: Brazil is still grappling with its most severe economic crisis in decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hotel officially opened for the Olympics, but months later remains unfinished. The top floors of the property, whose design evokes a futuristic pyramid, are closed. Parts of the hotel still resemble a construction site, including the second floor, where pleasure-seekers were supposed to mingle in a nightclub overlooking the Atlantic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The examination of the project by Mr. Lopes, the federal prosecutor, has already found a series of &quot;highly suspicious&quot; potential irregularities warranting a criminal investigation, according to court documents. &quot;It is necessary to verify if the favoritism shown by the pension funds to LSH and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization was due to the payment of illicit commissions and bribes,&quot; Mr. Lopes said in documents filed in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his filings, Mr. Lopes said the size of the hotel investments relative to the overall holdings of the small pension funds reflected a highly unusual level of risk, especially for an unfinished venture that failed to capitalize fully on the demand for accommodations during the Olympics. Going further, Mr. Lopes positioned the inquiry within a broader investigation of public pension funds, pillars of the Brazilian economy that often work in tandem with large state-controlled banks and energy companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first took interest in a Rio hotel venture in 2012, when Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was having lunch in Florida with Paulo Figueiredo Filho, a businessman who is agrandson of Jo&atilde;o Figueiredo, the last autocrat of Brazil's 21-year military dictatorship, which ended in 1985. The younger Mr. Figueiredo spearheaded the hotel venture until recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brazilian partner, LSH, said it was innocent of any wrongdoing in connection with the investments by the pension funds, and was cooperating with the criminal inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan Garten, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization's general counsel, said in a statement issued Friday that the investigation was not targeting Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or his company - given that it does not own the hotel - and &quot;has no knowledge whatsoever regarding any governmental inquiry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> projects is unfolding at an awkward time for the Brazilian authorities. Foreign Minister Jos&eacute; Serra, Brazil's top diplomat, publiclydeclared in July that a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency would be a &quot;nightmare.&quot; Although President Temer has formally congratulated Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on his victory in a letter, he is still among world leaders who have not yet spoken by telephone with the president-elect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if Brazil's executive branch actively tries to seek warmer relations with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, officials will face obstacles if they try to quell the investigation. Brazil differs from some other countries in Latin America where presidents can easily exert pressure on prosecutors and judges, with the judiciary steadily growing more independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Brazilian diplomats could try to avoid the problem of referring to the investigation when dealing with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration, but that's about all they can do,&quot; said Maur&iacute;cio Santoro, a political scientist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. &quot;This is something that could hang over relations between the two countries for years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potential Pitfalls in Dual Roles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side of the world, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jr. had other projects he was pushing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2012, he flew into Mumbai for a brief meeting with the state's chief minister at that time, hoping to salvage a residential tower representing the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization's first planned project there. He was hoping the chief minister, Prithviraj Chavan, would intervene on his behalf to get the permission needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants recall the meeting differently: Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> partner, Harresh Mehta of Rohan Lifescapes, said development regulations had changed, leaving the project in limbo, and they hoped Mr. Chavan could formalize a policy so that the project could continue. Mr. Chavan said that in a 30-minute meeting, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his partner were &quot;requesting a concession that could not be given.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of the meeting, in any case, it was fairly clear that the younger Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presence had not worked any magic. The project was shelved soon after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He thought the name was so big, we would bend backwards to satisfy him, but that was not the case,&quot; Mr. Chavan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalpesh Mehta, managing partner of Tribeca Developers of Mumbai, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization's development partner in India, confirmed that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jr. had met with the chief minister, but disputed the claim by Mr. Chavan that he had sought a special favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The notion that a request was made by Donald Jr. to waive any regulations is absolutely false,&quot; Mr. Mehta said in the statement, which was issued Friday. &quot;The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization does not get involved in the regulatory aspects and/or interacting with government officials related to its projects in India.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This example, analysts here say, points to a potentially serious ethical hazard for a United States president who is also a real estate mogul in India, with five projects underway. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was operating much like other developers in India, who cozy up to politicians - officially or unofficially - to push projects through the bureaucracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often, they must obtain as many as 60 permissions and building permits from government officials, including bureaucrats &quot;whose main goal in life is to attract rent,&quot; said Saurabh Mukherjea, the chief executive of institutional equities at Ambit Capital, a leading investment bank in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> projects, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Towers Pune, is in fact under investigation by local authorities after another builder alleged that one of its permits was fraudulent. Panchshil Realty has disputed that accusation, saying the permit in question was not required for the construction. The very nature of the country's real estate business, however, underscores larger concerns about potential damage to American efforts to discourage corruption in business abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In India, real estate is the main vehicle politicians and businessmen have used to invest so-called black money, on which taxes have not been paid. In cities, where land is scarce and extraordinarily valuable, special favors from top political leaders can lead to windfall profits, and negotiations between developers and officials are informal affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is so routine for developers to pay bribes at every step of the approval process that many bureaucrats have informal rate sheets showing exactly how much must be paid to each official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians not only pressure the bureaucracy to approve their pet projects, sometimes even when they are against local regulations, they also squeeze government banks to give out favorable loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top officials might &quot;think in some way the U.S. president will help them,&quot; and &quot;can put in a friendly word with the banks&quot; to extend loans for around 8 percent interest, rather than the characteristic 15 percent, said Vikas S. Kasliwal, the chief executive officer and vice chairman of Shree Ram Urban Infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the son goes himself, if the son is willing to go and meet the prime minister of India, or the urban development minister, that is a very big thing,&quot; he said. &quot;They will think the president is meeting them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another pitfall is that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> partners in major projects are, in some cases, politicians themselves. Most major Indian developers have some sort of alignment, direct or indirect, with regional political leaders, who can assist in acquiring the necessary permits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first projects in India, which are expected to increase in number over the next year, follow this pattern: His partner for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Towers Pune is Panchshil Realty, owned by a family that has a close and longstanding family relationship with one of the state's most powerful politicians, Sharad Pawar, the head of the small but influential Nationalist Congress Party. (Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was photographed - in an image distributed on Twitter but since taken down - with executives from Panchshil Realty on Nov. 15.) Mr. Pawar's daughter, Supriya Sule, a member of Parliament, holds a 2 percent share in Panchshil's parent company, she said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> partner in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower Mumbai is the Lodha Group, founded by Mangal Prabhat Lodha, vice president of the Bharatiya Janata Party - currently the governing party in Parliament - in Maharashtra State. The Lodha Group has already negotiated with the United States government; it announced a landmark purchase of a property, known as the Washington House, on tony Altamount Road, from the American government for 3.75 billion rupees, almost $70 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His partner in an office complex in Gurgaon, near New Delhi, is IREO, whose managing director, Lalit Goyal, is the brother-in-law of a Bharatiya Janata member of Parliament, Sudhanshu Mittal. Mr. Mittal, in an interview, has denied having any connection with the real estate company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suraj Hegde, the secretary of the All India Congress Committee, a national body of Indian National Congress party members, said he was troubled by the dual roles Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his family would play in Indian affairs - particularly given real estate's important role in India's fast-growing economy, and the clout the United States has on the world stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Basically this is the globalization of lobbying across countries, which then tries to establish monopoly over real estate,&quot; Mr. Hegde said in an interview. He added that he was already calling for an independent parliamentary investigation of such maneuvers, including Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> real estate ventures in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Establishing monopoly at the cost of small players by business connections to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is very worrisome,&quot; he said. &quot;This is not at all healthy for a democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TURKEY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mixing Business, Politics and Islam</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business interests in Turkey are emblematic of two weighty contradictions for a businessman turned politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a candidate, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> railed against moving American jobs overseas and promised to do something about it. As a businessman, he invested in a partnership with a furniture company here, making luxury furniture in the firm's factory in western Anatolia and selling it in the United States and worldwide - a partnership that apparently remains active.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the candidate inveighed against Muslims and threatened at least a temporary ban on their entering the United States. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the businessman has in recent years had some of his biggest expansions overseas, including in Muslim countries like Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and even Azerbaijan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most visible Muslim-world symbols of that contradiction is in the bustling commercial district of Sisli, on the European side of Istanbul, where a pair of cantilevered modernist towers, nearly 40 stories high, bear Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey's leader, Mr. Erdogan, visited </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Towers Istanbul - one holds luxury apartments and one office space, with a shopping mall connecting the two - after their completion in 2012, with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appearing as part of the celebration the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We look forward to this being the first of many world-class developments undertaken together in Istanbul and throughout Turkey,&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in a statement issued during the visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Video: Donald and Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> visited Istanbul in 2012 after the completion of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Towers Istanbul.  Watch on YouTube.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond real estate, there is the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization's 2013 partnership with Dorya International, a luxury furniture maker with a factory in Manisa Province, near the city of Izmir, to build pieces sold under the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Home Collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the presidential campaign demonstrated how the goals of his business and politics ventures can come into direct conflict, particularly once Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in December proposed barring Muslims from entering the United States, implying that all Muslims might pose a terrorist threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We regret and condemn </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> discriminatory remarks,&quot; Bulent Kural, the manager of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Towers Mall, wrote in an email to a reporter at the time, as he announced that the mall was considering removing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name. &quot;Such statements bear no value and are products of a mind that does not understand Islam, a peace religion, at all. Our reaction has been directly expressed to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family. We are reviewing the legal dimension of our relation with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Erdogan weighed in on the issue, too, saying, &quot;The ones who put that brand on their building should immediately remove it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> next move helped re-establish his standing. After a failed coup in Turkey in July, he defended Mr. Erdogan's crackdown on dissidents, saying in an interview with The Times that the United States has to &quot;fix our own mess&quot; before trying to alter the behavior of other nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think we have a right to lecture,&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in the interview.&quot;Look at what is happening in our country,&quot; he added, referring to violence in the United States. &quot;How are we going to lecture when people are shooting policemen in cold blood?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In between his two remarks - one infuriating the president of Turkey, the other comforting him - the calls for the renaming of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Towers Mall ended. But much more is at stake in relations between the United States and Turkey than a shopping mall and two skyscrapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey is a key player in United States efforts to combat the Islamic State in the Middle East, and sits next door to Syria as the United States has armed rebel groups in an attempt to remove Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, from power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent postelection telephone call between Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mr. Erdogan suggests that business and political roles will continue to be mixed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a Turkish journalist, Amberin Zaman, writing in the independent online news outlet Diken, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told the Turkish leader that he and his daughter - who participated in the call - admired both Mr. Erdogan and Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business associate in the towers, whom he called &quot;a close friend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Zaman, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, said no government officials had disputed her account of the conversation. &quot;I'm of the opinion they were quite happy for this to be published,&quot; she said. A spokeswoman for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> declined to comment about the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jennifer Harris, who served on the staff of the National Intelligence Council and on the State Department's policy planning staff, said the twin hats that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his family would be wearing in Turkey would almost certainly complicate the jobs of American diplomats there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It makes me wonder if the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration will use the power of the state to help political or business allies and hurt political adversaries and business rivals,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE PHILIPPINES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Stance Toward Duterte?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Duterte's antidrug campaign has led to the summary deaths of thousands of suspected criminals at the hands of police and vigilantes since he took office June 30. The killing has been condemned by human rights activists - and the Obama administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August, Elizabeth Trudeau, a State Department spokeswoman, said the United States was &quot;very deeply concerned&quot; about reports of &quot;extrajudicial killings by or at the behest of government authorities of individuals who are suspected to have been in drug activity in the Philippines.&quot; She added, &quot;We have also made our concerns known.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question now, former State Department officials say, is just what kind of a stand the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration will take as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his family balance their personal and financial ties with foreign policy demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Antonio first met Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> casually in the 1990s and has been his business partner in the Philippines for five years. President Duterte named him special envoy to the United States as the Philippines angrily pushed back at President Obama for criticizing his deadly campaign. At the time of the appointment, Mrs. Clinton was leading in the polls in the United States presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Duterte has made clear that he does not appreciate American meddling in his country's domestic affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am a president of a sovereign state, and we have long ceased to be a colony,&quot; Mr. Duterte told reporters in early September, before a scheduled meeting in Laos with Mr. Obama that never took place. &quot;I do not have any master except the Filipino people, nobody but nobody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Duterte handpicked Mr. Antonio as his intermediary with the United States, said his press secretary, Ernesto Abella, because of his business success, his previous experience as a special envoy to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Philippine president's &quot;deep intuition about people.&quot; The appointment will be advantageous for the Philippines, Mr. Abella added, because Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> already knows Mr. Antonio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been sworn in, Mr. Antonio flew to New York and visited </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower, where he met with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> children, who are executives at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization - which oversees the president-elect's real estate ventures. This was a business trip, not a diplomatic one, Robbie Antonio, Mr. Antonio's son and the managing director of the family business, said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two families are considering new ventures as they finish work on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tower in Makati City, a financial center within metropolitan Manila that is one of the country's wealthiest enclaves and home to many of the nation's elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The $150 million tower - one of the tallest in the Philippines - is on the gritty side of Makati about two blocks from Manila's most notorious red-light district, where it is common to see prostitutes soliciting business and people sleeping on sidewalks. Completion, originally scheduled for this year, is now expected in 2017. About 240 of the 260 units have been sold, said Kristina Garcia, the director for investor relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are bringing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to the Philippines because we believe that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> exemplifies the best quality of real estate anywhere in the world,&quot; Mr. Antonio said in a 2011 video promoting the project - in which Mr. Antonio is identified as &quot;ambassador&quot; and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also appears. &quot;It also exemplifies luxury and it exemplifies exclusivity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the interview at the celebration in Manila on Thursday evening, Robbie Antonio said he had little doubt of his father's priorities: He will put the Philippines' interests above those of his company. &quot;It is for the good of the country now,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr. Fuchs, who helped oversee United States relations with the Philippines as the deputy assistant secretary of state until early this year, said he was deeply troubled by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> overlapping priorities, particularly given the long list of globally significant issues in play with the Philippines. These include planned joint military exercises in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, the fight against militant Islamic groups based in the country's southern islands, and the human rights abuses taking place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we already have is a blurring of the lines between official and business activities,&quot; Mr. Fuchs said. &quot;The biggest gray area may not be a President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> himself advocating for favors for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization. It's the diplomats and career officers who will feel the need to perhaps not do things that will harm the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization's interests. It is seriously disturbing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IRELAND and SCOTLAND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over a Tiny Snail, Big Concerns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vertigo angustior snail is only two millimeters long. But it punches above its weight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The endangered little snail has helped stall Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans to build a sea wall to protect the coastline along his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Golf Links course on the west coast of Ireland, in County Clare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists, as well as surfers, list a host of concerns about the proposed wall, particularly its potential impact on sand dunes. Along with the snails, a patch of the dunes near the course is protected by European Union rules. But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> organization has said the golf resort development might be dead in the water without the sea wall, and many locals welcome the business and the jobs it brings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The battle is likely to be decided next year in front of a national planning board, in the weeks or months after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is inaugurated on Jan. 20, several people said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The planning board was overhauled in the 1980s to insulate it from political meddling, and it now has the confidence of environmentalists. But there is little precedent for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> situation, which could involve a public hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can be long, they can be lively, and a lot of things could be aired,&quot; said Sean O'Leary, the executive director of the Irish Planning Institute, which represents the majority of the country's professional planners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the national planning board had considered a development proposed by a politician before, but that was a holiday home that the Irish president wanted to build.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The scale is slightly different,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local officials have said the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization needs to resubmit its application by the end of the year. In a statement, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization said it was &quot;considering all potential coastal protection options at present&quot; and would be in contact with the local authority before Christmas. The snail, the statement said, &quot;is thriving on the site.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Its only material threat is that presented by coastal erosion,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[Video: A video by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization advertising its golf course in Scotland.  Watch on YouTube.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> golf courses in Scotland and Ireland have remained at the fore in the president-elect's mind, even in recent days. Shortly after his election, he urged a group of &quot;Brexit&quot; campaignersled by Nigel Farage, the head of the U.K. Independence Party, to fight against wind farms in Britain. Wind farms have been a favorite target of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in both Britain and Ireland, where he has railed against proposed installations as a potential blight on the views from his resorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a spokeswoman for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> initially denied that the matter had been raised with Mr. Farage's group, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> conceded during his interview with The Times this past week that &quot;I might have brought it up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony Lowes, an activist who runs a group called Friends of the Irish Environment, said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had once called him because Mr. Lowes's group also happened to oppose a proposed wind farm near Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Irish course on environmental grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He certainly hates wind farms, that's for sure,&quot; Mr. Lowes said about the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His group decided against working with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and is now a leading opponent of his planned sea wall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The dune system will not be able to develop naturally,&quot; Mr. Lowes said. &quot;It will be starved of the sand it needs to develop and evolve and it will die.&quot; He added, &quot;The whole system there is alive and mobile and moving, and the wall is intended to stop that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> representatives have advanced a number of rationales for the sea wall, with the most straightforward being that they simply want to buffer the land from a continuing erosion problem. The proposal has previouslyattracted attention because an environmental-impact statement submitted by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> team highlighted the risks of climate change and its influence on &quot;coastal erosion rates.&quot; That was a noteworthy claim, since Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has called global warming a hoax perpetrated &quot;by and for the Chinese.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Irish government has zealously courted Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. When he visited the course in 2014, he was greeted on the airport tarmac in Shannon with a red carpet, a harpist, a violinist and a singer whose voice cut through the runway clamor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malachy Clerkin of The Irish Times called it &quot;a preposterous welcome&quot; and &quot;the worst kind of forelock-tugging.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many locals, however, support Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> development. Hugh McNally, the owner ofMorrissey's Bar in Doonbeg Village, about two miles from the course, said the issue had been &quot;sensationalized by the media&quot; because of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> connection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll give you an example,&quot; he said. Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical company, announced last year that it wouldclose a plant in nearby Clarecastle, causing the loss of more than 200 jobs. &quot;If someone told them you'd save those jobs by building any wall, everyone would do it,&quot; he said. &quot;The only reason people are objecting here is because of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE WORLD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Transition and a Business Plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family appears to have been preparing for the transition to the Oval Office and ways to capitalize on it both in the United States and around the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April, even before Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had secured the Republican nomination, his business moved to trademark the nameAmerican Idea for use in branding hotels, spas and concierge services, according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. It was one of more than two dozen trademark applications that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and members of his family filed in the United States and around the world while he was running for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The applications offer a glimpse of where the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trumps</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may intend to focus their business endeavors. Last month, representatives of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization in Indonesia, where Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been pursuing two hotel deals, filed trademark registrations for use of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name in connection with hotel management. Similar filings have been made in Mexico, Canada and the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has filed at least 25 trademark registrations for her brand of clothing, cosmetics and jewelry in the United States, Canada, the European Union and Mexico since the beginning of the year, most recently in October. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wife, Melania, filed an American trademark application for a line of jewelry in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he prepares for the presidency, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has made at least one concession so far, he said in the interview with The Times this past week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In theory, I can be president of the United States and run my business 100 percent, sign checks on my business,&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said, before later adding, &quot;but I am phasing that out now, and handing that to Eric </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Don </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for the most part, and some of my executives, so that's happening right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
