<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is reopening mines amid worries about power supplies, demonstrating how difficult it will be to wean its giant economy from coal dependence.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JINCHENG, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - America's uncertainstance toward global warming under the coming administration of Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has given </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a leading role in the fight against climate change. It has called on the United States to recognize established science and to work with other countries to reduce dependence on dirty fuels like coal and oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is a problem: Even as it does so, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is scrambling to mine and burn more coal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lack of stockpiles and worries about electricity blackouts are spurring Chinese officials to reverse curbs that once helped reduce coal production. Mines are reopening. Miners are being lured back with fatter paychecks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> response to coal scarcity shows how hard it will be to wean the country off coal. That makes it harder for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the world to meet emissions targets, as Chinese coal is the world's largest single source of carbon emissions from human activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> watchers, the turnabout also has contributed to questions about the fate of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> current crop of economic planners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in Jincheng, a smoggy city in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coal country, the about-face has led to a steady hum of activity. On a recent afternoon, other trains stopped to make way for two electric locomotives, their horns blowing, pulling more than 50 empty coal hopper cars ready to be filled. Large coal-carrying trucks now form half-mile lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allan Zhang, an electrician who works at a mine here, said his employer had raised monthly pay by nearly 50 percent since the summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago brought &quot;the autumn of coal, and 2015 and earlier this year were the winter of coal,&quot; Mr. Zhang said. &quot;Now is the springtime of coal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revival of coal production shows the flaws in the country's half-finished evolution from central planning to the free market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coal problems stem from a series of official decisions that ramped up activity from energy-intensive industries even as they curbed mining output. Speculators in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> volatile financial markets, already prone to producing bubbles, ran up the price of coal. Weather and other setbacks haven't helped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coal still produces almost three-quarters of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> electricity, despite ambitious hydroelectric dam projects and the world's largest program to install solar panels and build wind turbines. Coal use in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also produces more emissions than all the oil, coal and gas consumed in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I get a kick out of people in the West who think </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is decarbonizing, because I see no sign of it whatsoever,&quot; said Brock Silvers, a Shanghai banker who has previously served on the boards of two Chinese coal companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Troubled by pollution and worries about rising sea levels, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> moved in recent months to rein in coal. Coal production dropped 3 percent last year - a result of that effort, but also a sign of slowing economic growth as well as a gradual shift in the Chinese economy toward American-style consumer spending and away from exports and heavy manufacturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That prompted the International Energy Agency to offer an optimistic reassessment this autumn: Chinese coal use peaked in 2013 and would now decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reversal now is prompting skepticism. &quot;There is still a peak coming,&quot; said Xizhou Zhou, the head of Asia and Pacific gas and power analysis at IHS Energy, a global consulting group. &quot;It's still going to increase.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IHS Energy forecasts that Chinese coal demand will not peak until 2026.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannes Tr&uuml;by, a senior coal and power analyst at the International Energy Agency, said that long-term trends in the Chinese economy meant that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coal use would decline over all. But with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stepping up production now, he said, &quot;We cannot exclude the possibility of a transient spike in coal demand in the next couple years that might take demand above 2013.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coal situation has put </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> powerful economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, under pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many executives and Chinese political experts predict that coal problems could be the final straw in a long list of difficulties that could lead President Xi Jinping to replace the agency's director, Xu Shaoshi. Mr. Xu is 65, an age at which Chinese ministers often retire, unless they are kept on to serve their terms or are promoted to vice premier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those experts, Christopher K. Johnson, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that such a move &quot;would be consistent with other recent personnel changes&quot; by Mr. Xi, who is chief of the Communist Party, to eliminate officials beholden to other factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That could clear the way for Mr. Xu to be replaced by Liu He, a deputy director of the agency who is close to Mr. Xi. Agency officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a matter of policy, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says it is still committed to global efforts to stem climate change. When environmental officials from around the world gathered in Marrakesh, Morocco, to discuss climate change this month, Xie Zhenhua, the leader of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> delegation, took an indirect swipe at Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, saying, &quot;a wise leader will follow the global and historical trend.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, cutting emissions looked easier for Beijing to achieve. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> electricity consumption was stalling, and many coal-fired power plants began operating only half the time. But state-owned coal mining enterprises, flush with loans from state-owned banks, kept building more mines, leading to losses and dropping coal prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began closing smaller, privately owned mines, cutting production while clamping down on some of the places that have made Chinese coal mining so dangerous. Just last summer, economic planners told mines they were not allowed to operate more than 276 days a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But developments were coming together to push prices up. Chinese investors piled into Chinese commodities markets, betting prices would rise. This became a self-fulfilling prophecy, as more speculators rushed in and bought more coal when prices rose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unusually hot summer and early autumn added to power demand. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> banking regulators decided to let banks release a flood of mortgages to home buyers to bolster economic growth. That produced strong demand for electricity from the steel and cement industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along the way, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had a run of bad luck. Flooding disrupted mines and rail routes last spring. A government decision to withdraw many trains from service this year for a new safety improvement campaign made it difficult to deliver supplies quickly. As a result, Chinese coal prices almost doubled from the start of this year until early November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's actually quite fascinating, how all of these things have come together,&quot; said Arnoud Balhuizen, the president of marketing and supply at BHP Billiton, the Australian mining giant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent weeks, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> changed course. It halted most coal trading on commodities markets and encouraged state-owned mines to sign long-term contracts at low prices with power stations. This month, the National Development and Reform Commission raised the number of days that mines could operate to 330 days per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will most likely be able to avoid blackouts, said Chang Yijun, the president of Shanxi Fenwei Energy, a regional coal consulting firm, who added that remaining output caps like the 330-day rule would still limit growth in emissions of greenhouse gases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents in mining towns are delighted. An avenue here in Jincheng is lined with huge billboards, each carrying the same cheery message: &quot;Coal prices are going up, and miners are smiling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zhang, the mine electrician, said that his mine's work force had shrunk from 300 two years ago to a maintenance crew of eight early this year, but that it had now expanded to 60 and the mine was still hiring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mine's stockpile of coal has nearly vanished. As more coal is hauled up from far underground, it is trucked away within two hours. &quot;Last spring, there were no lines of trucks,&quot; he said. &quot;Now there are so many.&quot;</SPAN></P>
