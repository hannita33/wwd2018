</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To read newspapers like this one, you might think that almost nobody has endorsed Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Ah, but maybe that's because The Times is, as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> puts it, ''totally dishonest,'' ''failing'' and ''a disgusting fraud.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In truth, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has actually attracted a broad range of endorsements that perhaps haven't received adequate attention. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For example, from terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I ask Allah to deliver America to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' a supporter of the Islamic State declared recently in an Arabic-language posting. Foreign Affairs quotes jihadists explaining that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would say and do such crazy things that he would end up helping extremist groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He must be smoking bad hashish to say such crazy things,'' one jihadist added. Supporters of ISIS say they hope </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would cause the United States to self-destruct, and that is why, as one put it, ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arrival in the White House must be a priority for jihadists at any cost!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been endorsed not only by terrorists, but also by nation states. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not the rough-talking, screwy, ignorant candidate they say he is, but is actually a wise politician,'' a columnist wrote in a North Korean propaganda magazine, DPRK Today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The magazine approved of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> threats to withdraw U.S. military forces from South Korea and noted, ''Who knew that the slogan 'Yankee Go Home' would come true like this?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then there's Russia, which seems to be not only backing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> but also perhaps releasing stolen emails to hurt the Democrats. There are also concerns that Russia will meddle with voting systems or leak other stolen materials -- or fake ones -- to try to influence the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Likewise, many Chinese leaders would like to see a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victory, according to Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution. The Chinese leaders apparently think </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would manage allies and American foreign policy poorly, thus reducing American influence and creating space for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's quite a list of influential backers -- ISIS supporters, North Korea, Russia and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. And it's matched at home by an array of strong endorsements that also, perhaps, don't receive adequate attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be best for the job,'' said the imperial wizard of the Rebel Brigade Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. ''The reason a lot of Klan members like Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is because a lot of what he believes, we believe in.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Likewise, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has the backing not only of the Republican Party but also of the American Freedom Party, a white nationalist organization. ''Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign may help remind Americans that all genocide, even against white people, is evil,'' said Bob Whitaker, who until spring was the American Freedom Party's presidential candidate, running with the campaign slogan, ''Diversity is a code word for white genocide.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The American Nazi Party's position is a bit more complicated. Rocky Suhayda, the party chairman, has predicted that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will win and that this will provide ''a real opportunity for people like white nationalists.'' But, apparently worried that Nazi support for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> might be counterproductive, he denied reports that on his radio show he had actually endorsed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Recently, the jews-media gave the Party international coverage over our last ANP radio show, where they 'claimed' that I 'endorsed' Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in another effort to 'SMEAR' the man,'' Suhayda wrote on the Nazi Party website. ''It was a typical kosher BIG LIE, as exposed and explained in Adolf Hitler's book Mein Kampf -- whereas they 'CLAIM' that Mr. Evil Nazi (me) has embraced Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for President, hence Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and myself are joined at the hip, being clones of Little Hitlerites.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So maybe </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't have the Nazi endorsement sewn up after all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He does have the backing of other prominent figures. Among them: Martin Shkreli, who as C.E.O. of Turing Pharmaceuticals raised the price of a lifesaving drug by more than 5,000 percent; Milo Yiannopoulos, recently banned from Twitter for leading internet trolls on a misogynist and racist campaign against Leslie Jones, the comedian and actress; and Alex Jones, the talk show host who has said that the Apollo 11 moon landing was faked and that no children were actually injured in the Sandy Hook school shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Washington Post published an early non-endorsement editorial, stating that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> constitutes a ''unique and present danger'' to America, but </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has won some publication endorsements -- such as one from The Daily Stormer, a white supremacist website, and one from The National Enquirer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  O.K., O.K., it's also true that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has support of tens of millions of Americans, including (sometimes grudgingly) leading Republicans, like Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell and John McCain. Yet one element that makes this election stunning is how many prominent Republicans have refused to endorse their nominee, while some have denounced him as a ''madman'' and ''bigot'' who has no more ''core principles than a Kardashian marriage.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But perhaps what's even more illuminating is the crowd that is endorsing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
