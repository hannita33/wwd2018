</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good evening. Here's the latest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. President Obama went to Capitol Hill to urge Democrats to fight to maintain his signature health initiative, the Affordable Care Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the bitter divide over the law will play out over the coming weeks, as Congressional Republicans turn to an arcane procedure called budget reconciliation to try to gut the law, which has allowed more than 20 million Americans to obtain health insurance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Intelligence officials will brief Congress on their investigation of election-related hacking on Thursday, ahead of a briefing for President-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continued to raise questions about the intelligence pointing to Russian involvement, making common cause with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is apparently moving to Washington. People familiar with the decision say she and her husband, Jared Kushner, have picked a $5.5 million mansion previously owned by a Latvian-born financier who has extensive investments in Russia and ties to a Russian opposition leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. California lawmakers are girding for ideological battles with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration over immigration, the environment and criminal justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawmakers hired Eric Holder Jr., Mr. Obama's former attorney general, to represent them in the legal fights they expect with the new White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are very, very serious,&quot; the State Senate's Democratic leader said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Already need a break? Here's our roundup of 52 places to go in 2017.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The choices, culled from hundreds of recommendations from our globe-exploring travel writers, range from the bucolic and secluded (the Ryukyu Islands in Japan) to industrial urban landscapes (the South Bronx). No. 1 is close to home: Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Turkey extended emergency rule for three months, and officials said they had identified the fugitive gunman who carried out a deadly rampage at an Istanbul nightclub on New Year's Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Recep Tayyip Erdogan insisted he would not let terrorism divide the nation. But Turkey's deep divisions are making unity difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Dylann Roof offered no apology or explanation for killing nine people at a historically black church in Charleston, S.C., in opening remarks in the sentencing phase of his trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the massacre, Mr. Roof accused black people of raping &quot;our women&quot; and taking over the country. A prosecutor read from the jailhouse journal Mr. Roof kept in the weeks after: &quot;I am not sorry. I have not shed a tear for the innocent people I killed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twelve jurors will decide whether he will be sentenced to death or life in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.  The city that supposedly never sleeps doesn't shoot as much as it used to. For the first time since at least the 1990s, New York City recorded fewer than 1,100 shootings in a calendar year. The 335 murders in 2016 almost tied the record low of 333.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a sharp contrast with Chicago - about half New York's size - which ended the year with 762 murders, the most in two decades, and more than 3,500 shootings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. New &quot;restorative justice&quot; programs are allowing crime victims and their survivors to meet with the people who upended their lives. Offenders can try to come to terms with their acts - and victims or their families can finally ask, &quot;Why?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple above met with the drunken driver convicted of killing their 21-year-old son, with powerful results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mother's offer of a hug &quot;changed my life,&quot; the man said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. We visited Liberty City in Miami, to meet with the makers of &quot;Moonlight,&quot; the critically acclaimed coming-of-age film set there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both filmmakers grew up in the area and are familiar with the poverty and struggle of the public housing projects, but also with their moments of community and beauty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Above left, Barry Jenkins, who directed, and Tarell Alvin McCraney, who wrote the semi-autobiographical screenplay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Finally, Ronaldo and Messi have some competition coming. From </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's No. 1 fan, President Xi Jinping, is bent on transforming his nation into a great soccer power, spending vast sums to lure talent from Europe and South America and try to upgrade its poor-to-middling rankings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real Ronaldo declined an offer of $105 million a year, his agent says.</SPAN></P>
