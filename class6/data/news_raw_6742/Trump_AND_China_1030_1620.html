</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next president will have to set the direction of the fight against terrorism, define America's role in the Syrian war, which has created a refugee crisis that is destabilizing Europe, and address the tensions between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and its neighbors that could turn into military conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet few of the presidential candidates have offered much sense of how they would actually take on these critical problems, and none, other than Hillary Clinton, inspires any confidence in this arena. The truth is, foreign policy will very likely dominate the next administration, as it has dominated much of the Obama presidency. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state, is the most experienced in foreign affairs among the candidates and is strongly supported by much of the Democratic Party's centrist foreign policy establishment. She is likely to continue on President Obama's path, though there is a concern that she might be too willing to intervene militarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator Bernie Sanders, Mrs. Clinton's Democratic rival, has repeatedly invoked the disastrous Iraq war, which he voted against, to deflect from the scant attention he has paid to foreign policy more broadly. While Mr. Sanders says the Islamic State, or ISIS, must be stopped, he has admitted he has no real solution to the threat. He talks vaguely of America having a support role in Syria while Saudi Arabia and Iran take the lead in sending ground troops against ISIS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton wanted to do more to help the rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad in Syria; she also supported the American intervention in Libya. She is calling now for a no-fly zone in Syria to protect civilians, which some Republicans have also advocated. Mr. Obama, like the Pentagon, has resisted that idea, which risks drawing America deeper into the Syrian conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the Republican side, the candidates have placed more emphasis on increasing military spending, which often leads to a reliance on military solutions over diplomacy. Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who revels in his ignorance of world affairs, often switches positions and has yet to put together a team of foreign policy advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator Marco Rubio may be the most hawkish contender. He is the only one still defending the Iraq war and praising President George W. Bush who ''kept us safe.'' Gov. John Kasich wants to arm the Ukrainian forces and believes it is ''time we punched the Russians in the nose.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When it comes to the Islamic State, most of the Republicans favor more bombing. Senator Ted Cruz has thundered about ''carpet-bombing'' the extremists, which would indiscriminately kill civilians. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has proposed sending American troops back into Iraq to take over the oil facilities. He is apparently unaware that ISIS pumps most of its oil in Syria and that any such oil grab would stoke anti-American sentiment. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> endorses waterboarding and other forms of torture. He seems to not understand that such practices are war crimes, banned by American and international law, erode the country's credibility and provoke more radicalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Syria, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mr. Sanders have said it would be unwise for the United States to topple Mr. Assad, pointing out that the region would be more stable if Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya and Iraq's Saddam Hussein had stayed in place. Yet, to solve the North Korean nuclear threat, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> should make North Korea's leader ''disappear,'' and Mr. Kasich argues for regime change, both risky options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All the Republican candidates have rejected the agreement that has constrained Iran's nuclear program, yet none has offered a credible alternative. Mrs. Clinton, who helped begin negotiations with Iran, and Mr. Sanders both support the deal. Mrs. Clinton is taking a much harder line in demanding that it be strictly enforced and that sanctions be tightened because of Iran's ballistic missile tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The next president will have to manage an unstable world where challenges are becoming more complex, from the aggressive policies of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Russia, to the India-Pakistan nuclear arms race and America's role in Asia. Voters know more about Mrs. Clinton's views than those of the other candidates. They deserve a fuller discussion on these issues from all of them.</SPAN></P>
