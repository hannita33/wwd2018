</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON - President Obama said on Thursday that the United States would retaliate for Russia's efforts to influence the presidential election, asserting that &quot;we need to take action,&quot; and &quot;we will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments, in an interview with NPR, indicate that Mr. Obama, in his remaining weeks in office, will pursue either economic sanctions against Russia or perhaps some kind of response in cyberspace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Obama spoke as President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Thursday again refused to accept Moscow's culpability, asking on Twitter why the administration had waited &quot;so long to act&quot; if Russia &quot;or some other entity&quot; had carried out cyberattacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president discussed the potential for American retaliation with Steve Inskeep of NPR for an interview to air on Friday morning. &quot;I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our election,&quot; Mr. Obama said, &quot;we need to take action. And we will - at the time and place of our choosing.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday morning, the Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, batted away the warning. &quot;It is necessary to either stop talking about it, or finally produce some evidence,&quot; he told the Interfax news agency. &quot;Otherwise, it all begins to look quite unseemly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House strongly suggested before the election that Mr. Obama would make use of sanctions authority for cyberattacks that he had given to himself by executive order. But he did not, in part out of concern that action before the election could lead to an escalated conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mr. Obama invokes sanctions on Russian individuals or organizations, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could reverse them. But that would be politically difficult, as his critics argue that he is blind to Russian behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, pressure grew on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Congress for him to acknowledge intelligence agencies' conclusions that Russia was behind the hacking. But aides said that was all but impossible before the Electoral College convenes on Monday to formalize his victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said privately in recent days that he believes there are people in the C.I.A. who are out to get him and are working to delegitimize his presidency, according to people briefed on the conversations who described them on the condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect's suspicions have been stoked by the efforts of a group of Democratic electors, as well as one Republican, who called this week for an intelligence briefing on the Russian hacking, raising the prospect that votes in the Electoral College might be changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his Twitter posting on Thursday, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggested that the government's conclusions on Russian hacking were a case of sour grapes by Mr. Obama. The president-elect falsely stated that Mr. Obama had waited until after the election to raise the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asked, although the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., formally blamed Russia on Oct. 7 for cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and other organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September, meeting privately in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Obama not only complained, the White House says, but also warned him of consequences if the Russian activity did not stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those in his own party, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> refusal to accept the evidence that Russia was the perpetrator was raising growing concerns, with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina saying he would not vote for Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nominee for secretary of state, unless Mr. Tillerson addressed Russia's role during his confirmation hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains to be seen whether Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stated doubts about Russia's involvement will subside after Monday's Electoral College vote. He and his allies have been concerned that the reports of Russian hacking have been intended to peel away votes from him, although even Democrats have not gone so far as to say the election was illegitimate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Right now, certain elements of the media, certain elements of the intelligence community and certain politicians are really doing the work of the Russians - they're creating this uncertainty over the election,&quot; Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, told reporters on Thursday after meeting with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many other Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator John McCain of Arizona, have publicly argued that the evidence leads straight to Russia. They have called for a full investigation, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, urged Mr. Obama on Thursday to complete an administration review quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twitter post was his latest move to accuse the intelligence agencies he will soon control of acting with a political agenda and to dispute the well-documented conclusion that Moscow carried out a meticulously planned series of attacks and releases of information to interfere in the presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as he repeated his doubts, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seized on emerging questions about the Obama administration's response: Why did it take months after the breaches had been discovered for the administration to name Moscow publicly as the culprit? And why did Mr. Obama initially opt not to openly retaliate, through sanctions or other measures?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White House officials have said that the warning to Mr. Putin at the September summit meeting in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> constituted the primary American response so far. When the administration decided to go public with its conclusion a month later, it did so in a statement from the director of national intelligence and the Homeland Security secretary, not in a prominent presidential appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said they were worried that any larger public response would have raised doubts about the election's integrity, something Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was already seeking to do during the campaign when he insisted the election was &quot;rigged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, criticized Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Thursday for questioning whether Russia was behind the attacks, referring to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> call during the campaign for Moscow to hack Hillary Clinton's emails, a remark his team has since dismissed as a joke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think anybody at the White House thinks it's funny that an adversary of the United States engaged in malicious cyberactivity to destabilize our democracy - that's not a joke,&quot; Mr. Earnest said. &quot;It might be time to not attack the intelligence community, but actually be supportive of a thorough, transparent, rigorous, nonpolitical investigation into what exactly happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he declined to confirm news reports that Mr. Putin was personally involved in directing the cyberattacks, Mr. Earnest pointedly read part of the Oct. 7 statement that said intelligence officials believed &quot;that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that language &quot;would lead me to conclude that based on my personal reading and not based on any knowledge that I have that may be classified or otherwise, it was pretty obvious that they were referring to the senior-most government official in Russia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a conference call with reporters later on Thursday, aides declined to explain Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> position on whether Russia had been responsible for the breaches or to describe what he would do about the issue as president. Jason Miller, a spokesman, said he would let Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;tweets speak for themselves&quot; and added that those raising questions about the hacking were refusing to come to terms with his victory. &quot;At a certain point you've got to realize that the election from last month is going to stand,&quot; Mr. Miller said.</SPAN></P>
