</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction Appended</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans a technology conference next week with high-profile business executives, many of whom opposed his campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; The chief executive of Carrier's parent company says many of those jobs at that plant in Indiana will now be lost to automation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Vice President-elect Mike Pence says the national security adviser-designate's son has nothing to do with the transition, and it appears he no longer does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who flies in his own private jet, appears to have ordered the cancellation of the next generation of Air Force One - via Twitter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to meet with tech industry C.E.O.s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is planning to convene a technology conference next week, according to a transition official who has seen the invitations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tech industry was almost universally opposed to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which might give the meeting a touch of combativeness. His transition team and cabinet posts draw much more heavily from Wall Street than Silicon Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is one major exception: Peter Thiel, a vocal </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> backer who is now in New York helping with the transition. Late last week, David Sacks, the chief executive of Zenefits, said he was stepping down amid conflicting reports that he will be working on the transition as well. Mr. Sacks is a longtime associate of Mr. Thiel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list of those being invited was not immediately clear, but among those expected are Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About those Carrier jobs in Indianapolis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect's move to save 1,100 jobs at a Carrier furnace plant in Indiana has been a political winner, even if it has raised concerns among economists on the left and the right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the chief executive of United Technologies, Carrier's parent company, says in the end, many of those jobs (he put the figure at 800) likely will fall to automation rather than Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with CNBC's JimCramer, the C.E.O., Greg Hayes was blunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're gonna make up $16 million investment in that factory in Indianapolis to automate to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive. Now is it as cheap as moving to Mexico with lower cost labor? No. But we will make that plant competitive just because we'll make the capital investments there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. CRAMER: &quot;Right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. HAYES: &quot;But what that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also confirmed that he feared standing up to the president-elect could be very costly to his conglomerate, which includes a lot of defense work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a cost as we thought about keeping the Indiana plant open. At the same time - and I'll tell you this because you and I - we know each other, but I was born at night but not last night. I also know that about 10 percent of our revenue comes from the U.S. government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fires at business; business holds back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president-elect has now taken shots at two American companies by name, Carrier and Boeing, which he suggested on Tuesday &quot;is doing a little bit of a number&quot; with the cost of an Air Force One redesign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That latter hit came after Boeing's chief executive told The Chicago Tribune he is leery of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This story in which Boeing CEO expressed concerns about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> views on trade posted just before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweet --https://t.co/aBvK87GzzW - Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) December 6, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How is business responding? Very cautiously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Business Roundtable conference call Tuesday to release its latest survey of how its members see the economy, Douglas R. Oberhelman, chairman of the business group and the chief executive of Caterpillar, did not criticize the president-elect's threats to punish companies if they move production abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's a great dialogue,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Oberhelman did push back on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> threat to impose tariffs on American manufacturers that export products made overseas back into the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he thinks we can negotiate better, then we ought to,&quot; he said. &quot;I do worry about retaliation with a 35 percent tariff or a unilateral action against a trading partner, especially if it's a big one like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Pence and the national security adviser-designate's son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice President-elect Mike Pence, appearing on MSNBC's &quot;Morning Joe&quot; program, said on Tuesday that the son of retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who posted a baseless fake news story on Twitter on Sunday night, has &quot;no involvement in the transition whatsoever.&quot; And indeed, Mike Flynn Jr. may have been pushed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">.@mike_pence: Gen. Flynn's son has no involvement in the transition whatsoever https://t.co/Te7XpUfxxg - Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) December 6, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The younger Mr. Flynn has sat in on some transition meetings and lists it as part of his biography. Until Monday, he had a transition email and has served as General Flynn's chief of staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Tuesday, emails to that transition address were bouncing back, and transition spokesman Jason Miller said on a morning conference call that the general's son is no longer involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discussion arose from the younger Flynn's tweet supporting the hoax that somehow Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman, John Podesta, ran a child sex-trafficking ring out of a Washington pizzeria, a conspiracy that prompted an armed attack on therestauranton Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until #Pizzagate proven to be false, it'll remain a story. The left seems to forget #PodestaEmails and the many &quot;coincidences&quot; tied to it. https://t.co/8HA9y30Yfp - Michael G Flynn (@mflynnJR) December 5, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the senior Flynn has put out conspiracy theories and fake news stories of his own on Twitter:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U decide - NYPD Blows Whistle on New Hillary Emails: Money Laundering, Sex Crimes w Children, etc...MUST READ! https://t.co/O0bVJT3QDr - General Flynn (@GenFlynn) November 3, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Pence will speak Tuesday night at a Heritage Foundation event at, where else, the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Hotel in Washington. No word yet what Heritage is paying the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization for the space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: Stop tweeting!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True, polls these days are a bit discredited, what with the election results and everything, but consider this: 56 percent of Americans think Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> uses Twitter too much. A strong plurality, 49 percent, said the president-elect's use of Twitter is a bad thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Morning Consult poll, of course, showed the usual partisan divide. Only 37 percent of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> voters said the president-elect was going a little heavy on the tweets, while 79 percent of Hillary Clinton voters thought so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then again, there were considerably more voters for Mrs. Clinton than Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless, he's tweeting anyway:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">#ThankYouTour2016 12/6- North Carolinahttps://t.co/79AHq3NC0v12/8- Iowahttps://t.co/1IuRTVwMSx12/9- Michiganhttps://t.co/2UTwAg5V87pic.twitter.com/QKGpE52Ukg - Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (@realDonaldTrump) December 5, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton defenders redouble attacks on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday morning, the liberal political action committee American Bridge rededicated itself to opposing the incoming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration at every turn, pledging to use many of the same hard-line tactics it used during the presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Elected leaders, they have to be gracious to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. That's not our role,&quot; said David Brock, the driving force behind several pro-Hillary Clinton efforts during the presidential election and the founder of American Bridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why American Bridge's advisers believe that what did not work during the election will suddenly succeed once Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> becomes president is unclear. During a conference call announcing its plans, an adviser went through the considerable resources the group can bring to bear like tens of thousands of hours of footage of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, an army of researchers digging into his background, a powerful media megaphone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American Bridge and other like-minded groups had all that during the campaign, of course. Asked what difference it all made, Mr. Brock pointed to the small comforts he could take in what was a devastating and unexpected loss: Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> historically low approval ratings, the high share of voters who say a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency frightens them, and Mrs. Clinton's success with low-income voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he added one more. &quot;We did win the popular vote,&quot; Mr. Brock noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By a lot - 2,653,958 votes and still rising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sacramento, CA: 18k new Clinton votes, 8k </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Clinton's national popular vote lead climbs to 2.65 million (2.0%): https://t.co/j58GaxfPmH - Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) December 6, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Brock did not mention - nor was he asked - whether abolishing the Electoral College would be on American Bridge's agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Ryan defends Taiwan phone call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said Tuesday that it was &quot;prudent&quot; for President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to accept a call from the leader of Taiwan, a move that has been sharply criticized as an affront to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think for him to not take a congratulatory call would in and of itself be considered a snub,&quot; Mr. Ryan told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ryan, who added that he had recently spoken to the Taiwanese president himself during a layover at a Miami airport, declined to comment on the appropriateness of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> subsequent Twitter posts about the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You think I'm going to sit here and comment on the daily tweets?&quot; he said. &quot;I'm just not going to do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ryan's defense came as evidence piles up that the call from the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, was not a simple congratulations but a thought-through effort to disrupt the foreign policy status quo. The Wall Street Journal reported that the call was facilitated by former Senator Bob Dole, who has a long history of lobbying for Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's fair to say that we may have had some influence,&quot; Mr. Dole, the former Kansas senator and Republican presidential nominee, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Republican elector won't vote for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christopher Suprun, a Republican elector from Texas, announced in The New York Times on Monday that he would not cast his vote for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when the Electoral College convenes - and a group of academics and lawyers are trying to coax more &quot;faithless&quot; electors to follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Mr. Suprun explained it:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States was set up as a republic. Alexander Hamilton provided a blueprint for states' votes. Federalist 68 argued that an Electoral College should determine if candidates are qualified, not engaged in demagogy, and independent from foreign influence. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shows us again and again that he does not meet these standards. Given his own public statements, it isn't clear how the Electoral College can ignore these issues, and so it should reject him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To give encouragement, and legal support, the Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig and the law firm Durie Tangri have teamed up to start what they are calling the Electors Trust, offering free counsel to other electors pondering Mr. Suprun's route.</SPAN></P>
