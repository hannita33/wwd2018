<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;What will the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency mean for domestic policy, foreign policy and the office of the president itself?<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> freewheeling style defies predictability. As Ross Douthat writes, &quot;Anyone who tells you, with perfect confidence, what a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration will do is either bluffing or a fool.&quot; Yet even though predictions can often be wrong, we still can't help making them - after all, humans crave some degree of certainty to navigate our lives and prepare for the future in an uncertain world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this lesson plan, we challenge students to make predictions about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency - but predictions grounded in as much evidence as they can gather. What can we expect from Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first 100 days in office? And as the months progress and students keep an eye on the news, how many of their predictions will turn out to be accurate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Below, we suggest activities and resources to help students better understand the implications of inaugurating a new president. What will a President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> mean for domestic policy, foreign policy and the office of the president itself? Students will have a chance to make evidence-based predictions, to voice their opinions and to take action to help create the country and world they want to see.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_________</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warm Up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ask students to answer the question below. They may choose to freewrite, create a two-column list or a mind map, or use any other method that helps them brainstorm. After they are finished, invite them to share their ideas with a partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are your hopes and fears for the new president? Why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After, you may want to hold a brief discussion to give students the opportunity to share their ideas with the class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Activity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explain to students that our hopes and fears are based on our predictions of what we think might happen in the future. They come from our impressions of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, derived from both the statements he has made and the actions he has taken during his campaign and his time as president-elect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal of this activity is to help students ground their predictions in fact, as much as that is possible. What has the president-elect said he wants to do? What about his cabinet picks? What is he more likely to accomplish? What will be more difficult?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've created this graphic organizer (PDF) for students to make predictions and track what happens over the first 100 days of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency, with space for students to take notes on the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prediction: What do you think President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will accomplish during his first 100 days?<BR> Evidence: What's the evidence you're using to make your prediction?<BR> Outcome: Track the news over Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first 100 days in office. Did your prediction come true? Explain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One resource that can help students generate and refine their predictions is this Times analysis of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Contract With the American Voter,&quot; (PDF) which he released during the campaign. In this contract, he pledged to &quot;clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, D.C.&quot; and &quot;protect American workers.&quot; At the heart of his promises is a plan to create jobs and grow the economy (he said 25 million new jobs with national economic growth at 4 percent a year). Is he going to do these things?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times divides these promises into three categories: doesn't need Congress, might need Congress and needs Congress. This additional analytical piece, identifying five of the most difficult and five of the easiest promises to keep, might also be helpful to students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following articles can also provide context to deepen students' understanding of the forces that will be at work in Washington:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This piece by Bloomberg offers additional analysis about the challenges Republican face now that they control the presidency and both branches of Congress.<BR> This article in FiveThirtyEight compares presidential accomplishments during the first 100 days in office. It was F.D.R.'s legislative sprint at the beginning of his first term that set the standard for all subsequent presidents.<BR> Peter Baker's article in The Times analyzes the significance of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> low approval ratings andpugnacious style heading into the inauguration, commenting that &quot;Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has approached the interregnum as if he were a television wrestling star.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using Evidence from the Transition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students don't need to depend on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign promises and past behavior to get a sense of what the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency will be like. We have had 10 weeks since he was elected president on Nov. 8 to learn more about how he might govern. Students can keep up with the latest via the Politics section, but a brief overview might include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> selected his cabinet picks, including the following nominees:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary of State - Rex W. Tillerson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil would oversee a department that has centered on alliance building and globalism, which Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he would dismantle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Tillerson was sharply questioned on his views on Russia, where he has had close business ties. He expressed reservations on climate change and said that he did not view it as the imminent national security threat that some others did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General - Jeff Sessions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senator from Alabama supports strict immigration enforcement and measures tough on crime. He would be responsible for carrying out Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;law and order&quot; platform and could change how civil rights laws are enforced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the first day of his hearing, Mr. Sessions said that the law &quot;absolutely&quot; prohibits waterboarding, and he offered no hints about a workaround to reinstate it. On the second day, testimony from Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and civil rights leader, highlighted the racial undertones of Mr. Sessions's nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education - Betsy DeVos</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party and an activist for school choice would oversee a department that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has said he wants to drastically shrink by shifting responsibilities to state and local governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her highly partisan hearing, Ms. DeVos was criticized by Democrats for wanting to &quot;privatize&quot; public education but praised by Republicans for her support of charter schools and vouchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pressured Carrier, an air-conditioner manufacturer, to keep hundreds of jobs in Indiana instead of moving them to Mexico. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has similarly leaned on car companies like Ford and General Motors to keep manufacturing in the United States. But critics were skeptical of his approach of using &quot;business-friendly tax benefits and incentives&quot; to seal the Carrier deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has escalated tensions with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and infuriated allies. The Times reports:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Germans are angry. The Chinese are downright furious. Leaders of NATO are nervous, while their counterparts at the European Union are alarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just days before he is sworn into office, President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has again focused his penchant for unpredictable disruption on the rest of the world. His remarks in a string of discursive and sometimes contradictory interviews have escalated tensions with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while also infuriating allies and institutions critical to America's traditional leadership of the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has continued to use Twitter as his 24-hour megaphone, denigrating the actress Meryl Streep and Congressman John Lewis, condemning mainstream news organizations like NBC and CNN as &quot;fake news,&quot; and even comparing the United States to Nazi Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> received briefings from the nation's top intelligence agencies that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia directed a vast cyberattack aimed at denying Hillary Clinton the presidency and installing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the Oval Office. The intelligence agencies also presented Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with a summary of unsubstantiated reports that Russia had collected compromising and salacious personal information about him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was warned by the government's top ethics monitor that his plan to place his vast business empire in a trust controlled by his two oldest sons was wholly inadequate and would leave the president vulnerable to &quot;suspicions of corruption.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students can select one or more of the topics above to research further. Then they can make predictions with even more detail and a more thorough understanding of these complex issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take Action (As an Extension to the Lesson)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Write President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a letter expressing what you want - or don't want - him to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students may be skeptical that their letter will be read by anyone, but President Obama had a routine of reading 10 letters every day while he was working in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the fall, thousands of students published their thoughts via an initiative called &quot;Letters to the Next President.&quot; Your students might find inspiration by looking through the collection - or you might use one or two letters as a model, such as this one by Keirah from Illinois. It begins:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Future President,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that you are president, will you make America great again? Will you secure America? I think that is something you should have asked yourself even before you thought about running. Me personally, I am tired of having a president for four years that doesn't live up to the changes they were supposed to make. I wish to see different. Can you actually make child care and college affordable? Can you build a good economy for us? America is corrupted, and we need someone who is dependable and determined to make it better again. It's important for us to know that this country can actually be great; all we need is respect for one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, students can write or call their elected members of Congress to express their position on important issues. Students should know that standing up for what they believe in can make a difference in our democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Follow Up With Outcomes<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the months following the inauguration, encourage students to keep up with current events to see which of their predictions turn out to be correct. One quick way is by taking our weekly News Quiz. At the end of April or in early May, when the first 100 days are over (April 29 is the 100th day of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency), students should revisit their predictions handout and fill in the third column for &quot;Outcomes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, as a class, reflect on the following through writing and discussion:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Which of your predictions came true?<BR> What did you learn - about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, about how our government works or even about yourself - by making these predictions and following up on them?<BR> Do you still have the same hopes and fears about the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency? Or have they changed in any way?<BR> What predictions can you make about the rest of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> term in office? Based on what evidence?</SPAN></P>
