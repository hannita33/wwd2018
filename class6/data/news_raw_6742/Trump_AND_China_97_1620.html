<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> financial dealings and vast web of businesses pose a number of potential conflicts as he prepares to lead the country.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next few weeks, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be deep in the throes of selecting cabinet members, reviewing potential Supreme Court justices and deciding on the top priorities for his new administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the middle of all that, he or his companies will be running golf courses in several states, managing apartment buildings in New York City and tending to properties all over the world. They will also be fighting a fraud lawsuit in San Diego, going to court against two chefs in Washington and continuing a long legal fight in Florida over airliners flying above his Palm Beach resort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A theme of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency is likely to be the clash of his duties running the country with the remnants of his decades as a hard-charging businessman. But federal rules and precedent make a couple of things clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will have no immunity from lawsuits involving his corporate ventures, thanks to a Supreme Court ruling involving Paula Jones, one of President Bill Clinton's accusers. And nothing will stop Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family from continuing to run its vast international web of businesses. Federal ethics laws and conflict-of-interest statutes that apply to other federal employees and cabinet members do not apply to the president.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is unprecedented in modern history to have the level of complexity of global substantial business relationships that the president-elect has, and the litigation that inevitably follows any complex global business venture,&quot; said Norman L. Eisen, a former special counsel for ethics and government reform under President Obama, who supported Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opponent, Hillary Clinton. &quot;It will be complicated, but not insurmountable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> faces potential conflicts on multiple fronts. He has income streams that could be affected by taxation policies he may try to get through Congress. His companies have hundreds of millions of dollars of debt from banks regulated by the federal government. In one case, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a part owner of an office building in Manhattan that carries a $950 million loan from lenders that include the Bank of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key source of his revenue is the licensing of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name, both domestically and abroad, and the value of that brand could be helped, or harmed, by actions he takes or does not take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization said it had begun the process of &quot;vetting various structures,&quot; with a goal of quickly transferring the businesses to three of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> children - Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric - along with executives. &quot;This is a top priority at the Organization and the structure that is ultimately selected will comply with all applicable rules and regulations,&quot; Amanda Miller, a marketing executive for the company, wrote in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a debate in January, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said he would put his holdings in a blind trust, an arrangement in which a public official lets a financial manager control his wealth and does not know exactly how the money is invested. But in the next breath, he acknowledged the problem with that strategy: &quot;Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, Alan Garten, a lawyer for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization, spoke of the difficulty of the task. &quot;There has been a huge event - a historic event - that has occurred,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no question that makes my job more complicated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under federal laws, executive branch employees must comply with conflict-of-interest rules that guard against being influenced by personal investments, and they must curb payments from sources outside the government. As a result, employees may have to recuse themselves from working on matters where they may have conflicts, holding certain properties or accepting money. For example, when Henry Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs executive, became Treasury secretary in 2006, he pledged to sell about $470 million in company stockto comply with conflict-of-interest rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the president and vice president were exempted from such laws, on the theory that they needed to be able to carry out their constitutional duties without restraint. So President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be able to take actions pertaining to another country even if he has business interests there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federal laws like those against bribery and receiving benefits from foreign countries still apply to the president. Enforcement would fall to the Justice Department or to Congress, which could pursue criminal or impeachment proceedings if evidence suggests laws were broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be required next year to file an updated personal financial disclosure listing his holdings, similar to the forms he has filed the past couple of years as a candidate. But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will not be required to make public his income tax returns, which he declined to do during the campaign, citing a continuing audit by the Internal Revenue Service, an agency he will now control. If he did release them, the tax returns could provide transparency into his international business dealings and other potential conflicts that may arise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As president, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will have no protection from lawsuits related to his life outside the White House, a result of the 1997 Supreme Court ruling that President Clinton could be sued by Ms. Jones in a sexual harassment case that dated to his time as Arkansas's governor. That litigation, which ended in an $850,000 settlement but no admission of wrongdoing, preoccupied Mr. Clinton in his second term and indirectly led to his impeachment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That ruling could set a trap for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - who has been accused by several women of unwanted advances, though none are currently suing him - and present a strategy for his political opponents to hamper his administration with litigation, legal experts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I anticipate that is going to be one of the first line of attacks against President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; said Richard W. Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2007, who endorsed Mrs. Clinton. &quot;It is potentially very destructive for the country as it was with Clinton.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, as Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was in Washington meeting with President Obama and congressional leaders, his lawyers were in court in San Diego for a lengthy hearing related to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University lawsuit, in which former students allege they were cheated out of thousands of dollars in tuition through deceptive promises and high-pressure sales tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has rejected the allegations. But on Thursday, one of his lawyers, Daniel Petrocelli, told the judge, Gonzalo P. Curiel - whom Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> accusedofbias because of his Mexican heritage - that he was open to discussing a settlement in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Petrocelli also said he might request to delay the trial to next year, saying more time was necessary because &quot;we're in uncharted territories&quot; in light of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election, The Associated Press reported. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University is also the subject of a lawsuit by the New York attorney general. That case will also continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his businesses are enmeshed in myriad other litigation. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been engaged in a lengthy dispute with Palm Beach County over jetliners flying over his Mar-a-Lago resort on the way to and from the nearby airport. In a lawsuit, he claimed that the noise, vibrations and emissions from the aircraft are disruptive to guests and damaging the property, including the Dorian stone and antique Cuban roof tiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in Washington, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has sued two celebrity chefs, Geoffrey Zakarian and Jos&eacute; Andr&eacute;s, after they backed out of restaurant deals at his new hotel development at the Old Post Office Pavilion after he made incendiary comments last year about Mexican immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Old Post Office project itself is a potential conflict. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization signed a 60-year deal with the federal government to redevelop and manage the building as a hotel - meaning that he will be, in a sense, his own landlord.</SPAN></P>
