<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;-&nbsp; President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> soaked in the cheers at the opening concert as the inaugural festivities began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&acirc;-&nbsp; But in downtown Washington, D.C., pro-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> revelers had to share the streets with adamant anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protesters. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; Never fear, though. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says his high I.Q. cabinet will unify the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A President-elect takes at center stage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The opening concert of the long inaugural week-to-weekend was the stuff of legend -- acts came, followed by protests, followed by withdrawals. Names were floated, like Elton John and Charlotte Church, only to have the artists publicly rebuke the invitation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But when it all finally came together, a beaming Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stood at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial on Thursday night, basking in the applause from thousands of concertgoers and vowing to ''unify our country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''But we're going to make America great for all of our people,'' the president-elect told the crowd. ''That includes the inner cities, that includes everybody.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Just hours before he was to be sworn in, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> still recalled grievances from the campaign. ''The polls started going up, up, up, but they didn't want to give us credit,'' he said. But he also turned his attention to the future, promising to work hard and saying he was looking forward to Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A tableau of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trumps</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- including the incoming first lady, Melania </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> grown children and their spouses, and his grandchildren -- then stood triumphantly at the top of the steps, framed by marble and under the gaze of the nation's 16th president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fireworks concluded the ''Make America Great Again'' concert, which featured Toby Keith and 3 Doors Down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the Candlelight Dinner, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The next president of the United States has a way with words, so let's just let him talk. At Washington's Union Station on Thursday night, he greeted honored guests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and adviser, he said, ''If you can't produce peace in the Middle East, nobody can.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To his White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, he commented, ''Nobody knew how to pronounce his name. It's a crazy name.'' The president-elect added, ''Reince was taking tremendous abuse because he went through hell.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then it was on to his re-election campaign, in 2020:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The next time, four years from now, the next time we're going to win the old-fashioned way, we're going to win because we did so well, because it was so overwhelming, the thing that we did, because it was so beautiful.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On that last point, it was not clear how he was implying he won in 2016: Russian interference? Losing the popular tally by nearly three million votes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As for Inauguration Day, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> saw a silver lining in the forecast rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If it really pours tomorrow, that's O.K.,'' he said, ''because people will realize it's my real hair.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Let the parties -- and protests -- begin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The inaugural kickoff celebration on the National Mall had been a subdued affair without protests, but at least one of the inaugural balls organized by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters has drawn protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The DeploraBall, a cocktail party organized by supporters of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and held at the National Press Club, drew several hundred protesters crowded into a city block, chanting and waving signs denouncing the incoming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sarko Sarkodie, 26, says she's part of the &quot;resistance efforts&quot; happening this week, including that dance party at Pence's house last night. pic.twitter.com/e3g1PDhu8z -- Katie Rogers (@katierogers) January 20, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sarko Sarkodie, a 26-year-old Washington resident, was part of the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm just part of the resistance efforts that have been happening this week,'' Ms. Sarkodie said. ''And they'll be happening over the next four years.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters seemed to be staying away from the event, but several people watched the scene from inside a nearby bar, where a man wearing a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> flag and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sweatpants could be seen embracing friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Steps away from the protesters, these men are shouting &quot;Deplorables!&quot; pic.twitter.com/5Z13zKkWoN -- Katie Rogers (@katierogers) January 20, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That's a brave dude, right there,'' a bystander said of the man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Several people wandered through the area in gowns, seemingly dismayed when they turned the corner to encounter the protests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But perennial presidential candidate and kid favorite Vermin Supreme made it to the show.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Peace Ball revelers lament their loss</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, a throng of people in floor-length ball gowns, dashikis, tuxedos and silk headscarves flocked to the sold-out Peace Ball: Voices of Hope and Resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I guess I was just looking for something to put my energy into and to give Obama a really good send-off,'' said Pavy Bacon, a 34-year-old Maryland resident, about why she bought a ticket to the ball. ''If you really appreciate what Obama has done, you can't help but be fearful of the next administration.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The event, which was in the works before Election Day, was not envisioned as an anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> affair. Anas ''Andy'' Shallal, an Iraqi-American artist and activist who owns the popular D.C.-based bookstore cafe chain Busboys and Poets, dreamed up the party as the ultimate celebration of the progress made under President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But as inauguration day drew closer, Peace Ball became a place for liberals to converge and comfort themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  John Osborne, a 55-year-old lawyer from Washington, D.C., perused the fourth-floor exhibits with his wife and said he came because -- on the eve of the inauguration -- he wanted to surround himself with people from all races, religions and backgrounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I wanted to be in a place that reflects the America that I see and live everyday,'' he said. ''I'm hopeful that our country will remain that way.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Expected guests included the actor Danny Glover, the Grammy-nominated artist Solange Knowles, four-time Grammy winning jazz musician Esperanza Spalding, the award-winning author Alice Walker and CNN pundit Van Jones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With such high I.Q.'s, surely they can unite the country</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Before the official festivities began, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeared at a luncheon with supporters at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Hotel, where he praised the collective I.Q. of his cabinet members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We have by far the highest I.Q. of any cabinet ever assembled,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in the remarks, which reporters heard only the first several minutes of before being escorted out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pres.-elect Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on his cabinet: &quot;We have by far the highest IQ of any cabinet ever assembled.&quot; pic.twitter.com/czBpZ4cNMD -- ABC News (@ABC) January 19, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Of course, he put himself into the high I.Q. category when he boasted, ''This is a gorgeous room. A total genius must have built this place.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  (As an aside, it is impossible to do the math, but President Obama's starters did include a Nobel laureate in physics at the Energy Department, a former president of Harvard heading the National Economic Council and the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank as Treasury secretary.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also singled out specific supporters, including Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets football team, and his pick for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> noted, wasn't at the lunch because he was being ''grilled'' at his Senate confirmation hearing several blocks away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also faulted senators for not being ''nice'' to Representative Tom Price of Georgia, his pick to be the health and human services secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Could this job help the Jets?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And speaking of Mr. Johnson, the Jets owner is expected to get one of the plum jobs in diplomacy, the United States ambassador to Britain, or as the Brits call it, ambassador of the United States to the Court of St. James's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Johnson is only the fourth ambassador to be announced by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, after Nikki Haley as ambassador to the United Nations; David Friedman, his longtime attorney, as ambassador to Israel; and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given that both Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his British counterpart, Prime Minister Theresa May, are relatively new in their roles, Mr. Johnson's ability to get Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the phone quickly could be helpful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At 5-11 this year, the Jets weren't the best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A busy day of ceremony and celebration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president-elect and vice president-elect laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then it was on to the Lincoln Memorial for the concert that opens the Inaugural festivities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Join me at 4pm over at the Lincoln Memorial with my family!#Inauguration2017 https://t.co/GQeQpJOgWz -- Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (@realDonaldTrump) January 19, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bikers for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are ready to roll</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Eric Huppert, the leader of Defenders of Liberty Motorcycle Club and local organizer of Bikers for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, stood beside a row of hulking V-twin Harley Davidsons and said he was not looking for violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Sure, Chris Cox, the founder of Bikers for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, had pledged that his members would act as a ''wall of meat'' to block anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protesters, but Mr. Huppert downplayed all that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I don't anticipate any skirmishes -- at least I hope not,'' he said. But if the safety of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters -- or even the president-elect himself -- is jeopardized, he added, ''I think these folks will be willing to jump in if necessary.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A security force beholden to no one with no rules of engagement and no real marching orders is, well, not a great idea. But Bikers for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stand by their man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  David Nichols traveled from Texarkana, Tex., with seven others to attend the Bikers for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally on Inauguration Day. The group drove for 22 hours straight, towing eight bikes on a 20-foot trailer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''He'll be a fine president -- he just has to calm down his words,'' Mr. Nichols said. ''Just don't bash people's name too much.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president-elect's choice to vouch for his unifying message: Franklin Graham</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A day before Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is to be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States, he took to Twitter to assert that he is not responsible for the nation's divisions. His champion? The Rev. Franklin Graham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;It wasn't Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that divided this country, this country has been divided for a long time!&quot; Stated today by Reverend Franklin Graham. -- Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (@realDonaldTrump) January 19, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To some, Mr. Graham's good wishes may not hold much weight. Last month on Facebook, he decried House Speaker Paul D. Ryan's failure to join him and the president-elect in ending all Muslim immigration ''until we can properly vet them or until the war with Islam is over.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He castigated Representative William Lacy Clay, Democrat of Missouri, for defending a high school student's artwork depicting a confrontation between citizens and police, depicted as pigs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And last year, Mr. Graham said of gays, ''you cannot stay gay and continue to call yourself a Christian.''</SPAN></P>
