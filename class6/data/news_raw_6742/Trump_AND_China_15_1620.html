<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- Both came to power vowing to restore their nations to greatness. But America's loud, ad-libbing president-elect, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> guarded, calculating president, Xi Jinping, are glaring contrasts as politicians, and their pairing has injected new unpredictability into relations between their governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I could not think of two more different protagonists in the great drama of U.S.-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relations,'' Evan S. Medeiros, formerly the senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, said by email. ''Personalities matter a lot in international relations, especially between great powers.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A quarrel after </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seized an underwater drone from the United States Navy has given a taste of how Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Mr. Xi's different styles could play out if bigger tensions were to break out over the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, trade imbalances, North Korea's nuclear weapons or other issues that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has raised.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has recently blared warnings at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, seemingly guided by visceral reflexes and a vague but bold set of demands. By contrast, Mr. Xi, the son of a Communist veteran, is disciplined and steely. He rarely speaks off the cuff in public. Even his seemingly impromptu gestures are often carefully choreographed, and he usually adheres to policy points when meeting foreign leaders. Mr. Xi is certainly capable of bold action, as he has shown in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, but he tends to shroud his thinking in a cloud of slogans. That leaves outsiders guessing about when and how he will act on his demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The situation could become quite combustible,'' said Jessica Chen Weiss, an associate professor at Cornell University who studies Chinese foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Xi Jinping is more measured in his public statements than Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, but the Chinese government will likely hit back quite forcefully against any radical efforts to challenge the status quo,'' Ms. Weiss said. ''The best thing the president-elect's advisers can do for our national security is to screen </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweets.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> took to Twitter on Saturday after the Chinese military confirmed that it had seized a submersible drone in waters about 50 miles northwest of Subic Bay in the Philippines. The Pentagon had revealed the seizure, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ministry of National Defense said it would return the device, which can be used to monitor undersea currents and conditions, in an ''appropriate manner.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> suggested that wasn't good enough. He said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seizure was an unprecedented act, and later added, ''We should tell </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that we don't want the drone they stole back.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> did not say how he would handle similar disputes after he is sworn. But his other comments so far suggest that he will take a blunter, less predictable course on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> than recent White House administrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This month, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke on the phone with Tsai Ing-wen, the president of Taiwan, breaking nearly 40 years of American presidents and presidents-elect avoiding direct conversation with the leader of the island, over which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> claims sovereignty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview with Fox News, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> then suggested he could depart from the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> principle, which blocks Washington from diplomatic ties with Taiwan, using that as a pressure point to seek trade concessions from Beijing. He also criticized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on trade, the buildup of military outposts in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea and its reluctance to isolate North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not used to the U.S. asserting and pushing its interests like the Chinese do,'' said Dan Blumenthal, the director of Asian studies at the American Enterprise Institute, who praised Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> blunter approach. ''If it is prepared for that, we will be able to avoid confrontation and conflict.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So far, Mr. Xi has not reacted publicly to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings. The two men had a brief but cordial call after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won the election. Chinese leaders rarely wade openly into disputes, leaving that to junior officials. But pressure for a tougher reaction to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could build in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> if he keeps lobbing out warnings, especially after he becomes president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Experts disagreed over whether </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seizure of the submersible drone was intended as a signal to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, or even authorized by Mr. Xi. But Chinese decision makers probably took into account that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> team would read it as ''a test and a warning,'' said Ni Lexiong, a naval affairs researcher at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It would be impossible for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not to react to his provocations,'' Mr. Ni said by telephone. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seems to want a foreign policy that keeps the other side guessing. But that way of working can easily lead to trouble.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Monday, an editorial in a prominent Communist Party newspaper said that Mr. Xi's government needed to be ready for rockier relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hits out with a hammer to the east and a club to the west, and his real thinking is very difficult to fathom,'' said the editorial in the overseas edition of the paper, People's Daily, using a Chinese saying that means to speak or act without rhyme or reason. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, it said, should ''stay steady on its feet, keep a good grasp of developments, calmly respond, and that's it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> calls for calm have barbs and caveats that could rile a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the Chinese defense ministry said it would return the submersible drone, it also said the Chinese ship showed a ''professional and responsible attitude'' by seizing the device, although the drone appeared to be outside even an extremely expansive view of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rightful reach in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chinese hard-liners are already urging a harsher response to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. On Saturday, Global Times, a newspaper often dominated by anti-American rhetoric, held a forum in Beijing where speakers urged tough retaliation if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> moved closer to Taiwan, and praised the seizure of the underwater drone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> isn't afraid of confrontation with America,'' Dai Xu, a former Chinese Air Force senior colonel and outspoken hawk, said at the meeting. ''Without </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cooperation, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will achieve nothing. I dare say that if he opts for confrontation with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he won't stay in office for more than four years.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another speaker, Jin Canrong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, told Global Times: ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is a dragon. America is an eagle. Britain is a lion. When the dragon wakes up, the others are all snacks.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such tough talk does not set Chinese foreign policy, but Mr. Xi and other leaders are sensitive to nationalist ire that they themselves have nurtured. Mr. Xi has summed up his vision of national rejuvenation and strength as the ''Chinese Dream,'' a theme he has promoted since taking office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pressures on Mr. Xi are likely to grow if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continues publicly excoriating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, especially on territorial issues, like Taiwan and the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, where public sentiment often favors a tough response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tends to give the new leader a grace period to settle in,'' Ms. Weiss said, citing her research about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> response to elections and new leaders. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has moved more quickly to challenge and defy </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> than other president-elects, however, so the grace period could end quickly.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American presidents know how swiftly relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can deteriorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 1999, President Bill Clinton struggled to repair ties after NATO bombs struck the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, then the capital of Yugoslavia, killing three people. The White House insisted the bombing was accidental, but the Chinese government did not believe that, and days of angry protests followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2001, a United States Navy reconnaissance plane made an emergency landing on Hainan, a Chinese island-province jutting into the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, after colliding with a Chinese Air Force jet whose pilot plunged to his death. Eleven days later, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> released the 24 American crew members, and the plane was recovered in parts over the following months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A scenario like that could unfold very differently under Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> perceives that he is being challenged, he will probably instinctively not want to be seen as weak,'' said Bonnie S. Glaser, the director of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''It will be very messy if he decides to tweet or speak publicly in a crisis before he has all the intelligence and analysis necessary.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Xi also has his domestic political timetable to worry about. He was appointed head of the Communist Party in 2012, and next year a party congress is all but certain to give him five more years in that job. But Mr. Xi must settle on a new cohort of senior officials to work under him, and during elite shake-ups the party leadership puts even more emphasis on stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The leadership has to balance those goals of preserving a more stable and predictable external environment with avoiding the perception of weakness and vulnerability,'' Ms. Glaser said. ''I tend to believe that the latter will </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the former if the Chinese leadership has to choose. Pun intended.''</SPAN></P>
