<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wayne Gretzky returned to Edmonton, the franchise he led to four Stanley Cups, for a new leadership role: partner and vice chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gretzky, the N.H.L. career scoring leader, has not held a job in a league front office since he was a part owner, coach and head of hockey operations with the Phoenix Coyotes. He left the team in 2009. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AROUND THE N.H.L. Vladimir Tarasenko had two goals and an assist as St. Louis won at Chicago, 5-2, in an opening-night matchup of Central Division rivals. Kevin Shattenkirk and Paul Stastny each had a power-play goal and two assists for the Blues, who eliminated the Blackhawks in seven games in the first round of the playoffs in April.  Jack Eichel, Buffalo's star second-year center, sustained a high ankle sprain in the Sabres' final preseason practice that will keep him out indefinitely.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Brady Passes on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tape Question</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tom Brady was not interested in answering any questions about Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Brady, the Patriots quarterback, was asked Wednesday at the end of his weekly news conference about how he would respond if his children heard </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> version of ''locker-room talk.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Brady smiled and said, ''Thank you, guys, have a good day.'' Then he walked away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made headlines recently after a 2005 video surfaced in which he was recorded making crude comments about women. He has since apologized for the comments, referring to it as ''locker-room talk.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last year, a hat bearing the ''Make America Great Again'' slogan used by the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign was spotted in Brady's locker. Brady joked about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> possibly putting a putting green on the White House lawn and said that he thought it ''would be great'' if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won the election, though he later backed off that comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NEWTON BACK AT PRACTICE Panthers quarterback Cam Newton took reps with the first-team offense after missing Monday's game against Tampa Bay because of a concussion. But Panthers Coach Ron Rivera said that Newton was still subject to the league's concussion protocol and that it was too early to know if the quarterback would play Sunday at New Orleans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  EX-BAYLOR COACH VISITS BROWNS Art Briles, the former Baylor University football coach who was fired last May amid a sexual assault scandal involving former players, attended Cleveland's practice in team gear. Browns Coach Hue Jackson did not discuss Briles's past but said that he believed Briles would have a chance to resurrect his career.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kyrgios Booed Off Court in Shanghai</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nick Kyrgios floated in slow first serves, was admonished by the chair umpire and argued with a fan before being booed off the court in a loss at the Shanghai Masters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kyrgios lost, 6-3, 6-1, to the German qualifier Mischa Zverev. During the first set, he tapped a soft serve over the net and started walking to his chair before Zverev hit his return, drawing a rebuke from the umpire Ali Nili.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When a fan yelled to Kyrgios that he should respect the game, he responded, ''You want to come here and play?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Andy Murray, Milos Raonic and the United States Open champion Stan Wawrinka all advanced to the third round, but Rafael Nadal was beaten by Viktor Troicki, 6-3, 7-6 (3).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fourth-seeded Nadal, who missed part of the season with a wrist injury and has struggled in recent tournaments, was considering ending his season early to focus on preparations for the Australian Open in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  RAIN IN HONG KONG Seventh-seeded Jelena Jankovic won the only completed match at the rain-delayed Hong Kong Open, beating the qualifier Aleksandra Krunic, 6-4, 6-3, to advance to the quarterfinals. Top-seeded Angelique Kerber was leading Louisa Chirico, 6-2, 3-6, 2-1, before their match was halted by rain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Emiliano Grillo of Argentina was named the PGA Tour's rookie of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Grillo received his award in Napa, Calif., at the Safeway Open, where he is the defending champion. He finished 11th in the FedEx Cup standings.</SPAN></P>
