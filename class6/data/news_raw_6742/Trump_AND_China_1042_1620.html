</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good morning.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We're trying something new for our readers in Asia: a morning briefing to jump-start your day.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here's what you need to know: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reported success in their opening salvos of a vast operation to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul from the Islamic State. Analysts say the battle could be a turning point in the American-led war against the militant group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forces face as many as 4,500 ISIS fighters, who have filled trenches with oil, blown up bridges, built tunnels and planted explosives in a city where more than a million civilians remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warplanes from the U.S.-led coalition are providing air support for the crucial operation, which could take months and involve nearly 30,000 troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of the Philippines is being accorded full state honors as he begins a visit to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, accompanied by a large contingent of business executives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As trade deals and investments are discussed, one major question is whether Mr. Duterte will give </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> what it most wants - scrapping an accord that gives the United States access to five military bases in the Philippines. (Above, Mr. Duterte in Brunei on Monday.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brimming with confidence and boosted by poll numbers across the United States, is beginning an ambitious assault on traditionally Republican states to further diminish support for Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spontaneous and relatively silent protests against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are emerging across America as some voters take aim at perhaps his most prized possession: his brand name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are emerging from Haiti, where a hurricane killed hundreds this month. In one ravaged area, villagers said they took shelter in caves - and will have to keep doing so until they can rebuild their homes. Until then, they'll continue to flee to the caves when it rains.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has failed to reduce its national poverty rate since 2004, with more than 13 percent of the population, or nearly three million people, still living below the poverty line, a new study says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official involved in the report criticized the country's leaders, calling the persistent problem a &quot;national shame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RT, which originated as Russia Today, called the interruption of its financial dealings a government-backed attempt to interfere with freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> top bankers in Asia, Mark Schwartz, will retire at the end of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over three decades, Mr. Schwartz catered to some of the firm's biggest clients and was central to Alibaba's $25 billion initial public offering, the biggest I.P.O. on record.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A black American doctor was in the news last week after writing on Facebook that a flight attendant seeking help for a sick passenger refused to believe she was a physician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her experience touched a nerve with other professional women of color who have faced skepticism about their credentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The episode also calls to mind the poet Phillis Wheatley's ordeals nearly 250 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kidnapped as a child in West Africa and sold into slavery, she was bought by the Wheatley family in Boston, who used for her first name that of the ship that brought her across the Atlantic. They taught her to read, and she channeled her intellect into writing poetry. Her work earned praise in both the colonies and Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Boston's most learned men, though, doubted that a slave could write so beautifully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1772, Wheatley successfully defended herself to an 18-member panel. She &quot;is thought qualified to write them,&quot; the men said of the poems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following year she toured England, where her book was released, &quot;marking the beginning of an African American literary tradition,&quot; according to Henry Louis Gates Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A letter to an acquaintance on this day in 1773 indicates that her notoriety also won her freedom. &quot;Since my return to America my Master, has at the desire of my friends in England given me my freedom,&quot; she wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in one of her poems, she addressed the pain of slavery more directly: &quot;And can I then but pray/Others may never feel tyrannic sway?&quot;</SPAN></P>
