</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emboldened by his string of presidential primary victories on Tuesday, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is taking aim at Hillary Clinton. On Wednesday he released a bizarre Instagram ad that depicts her, well, barking. Whatever. By now many Americans are realizing that when it comes to making strange noises, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is Best in Show. As proof, here's his barkin' mad Super Duper Tuesday victory speech&nbsp;in Palm Beach, Fla., uncut and uncensored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody. This was an amazing evening, this was a great evening. They just announced North Carolina.&nbsp;I don't know if they've announced Illinois yet, but we're leading by a lot so I think they're gonna announce it. Ah, Florida was so amazing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I want to thank our friends, Northern Mariana's Islands have been so incredible. And we picked up nine delegates this morning. I heard very early in the morning, nine delegates, that's a lot. And I just wanted to thank the governor, Ralph Torres, great guy, Chairman Ada, who is a fantastic man. That was a very nice start to the day, that I can tell you.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many things have been happening over the last short period of time. CNN was very nice, they came up with a poll, the poll said 49 percent to 14 and 15. We just had one from&nbsp;The Economist, just came out, 53 percent. And it's sort of interesting because I was watching the news a little while ago, and one of the commentators-who I'm not particularly fond of, but these are minor details-said, but Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doesn't get over 50 percent. Because I'm at 43, 45. Actually now, according to the&nbsp;The Economist&nbsp;I'm at 53. And I have to explain to these people, they don't understand basic physics, basic mathematics, basic whatever you want to call it. When I don't get over 50-we have four people, right? We have four people, do you understand that? So when I get 53 in this one, as an example, I had 53, and that's with four people. That's an amazing achievement just mathematically when you can get over 50 percent, so someday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someday they're gonna understand. Someday when we-when we-when we take it all they'll understand but it is really ridiculous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want to thank my family. My boy Eric, and Don, they've been working so hard.&nbsp;Ivanka and Jared have been amazing. Ivanka is home right now. In about two minutes I'll call and she's about ready to have a baby. So I don't know&nbsp;sort of thing. We've been thinking about that now for a little while. But Ivanka's been so helpful and Jared has been amazing and it's been just great. I want to thank Barron for putting up with the fact that I never see him anymore. And I want to thank Barron, I never see my Barron, and it's his birthday on Sunday, so we're very happy about that. So it's a little tough, you know, when you're going away, and.&nbsp;He goes, when are you going to be come home, Daddy, when are you coming home. I said, well in about two and a half weeks, it's pretty tough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You're traveling all over the place, it's really amazing. Yesterday I went up to Ohio, I went up to Youngstown. We had an incredible crowd and just amazing people in this country. We have so so many great people. We will, someday, in the not too distant future-if I win, otherwise it's not gonna happen, I have to be honest with you-but Apple and all of these great companies will be making their product in the United States, not in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Vietnam, and all of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we're not going to be losing our companies. You know, our companies are leaving our country rapidly. Rapidly. Whether it's Carrier Air Conditioning, whether it's Ford, whether it's Eaton. I was in Cleveland and Eaton Corp., they're leaving. And so many companies are leaving. And frankly I'm disgusted with it. And I'm tired of seeing it. And there's no reason for it. It's just gross incompetence at the highest level. We should not allow it to happen. Pfizer, great company, pharmaceutical company, they're going to Ireland. And there's so many more. You have corporate inversions. You have people can't get their money back into the country because the politicians can't get along, they can't make a deal. Everybody agrees, Democrat and Republican. Everybody agrees the money should come back. There's two and a half trillion dollars outside of this country. Everybody agrees that the money should be here, and the politicians for three years haven't been able to make a deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we could make a deal. There's an example of something that you could do. If I sat down with a few of the senators and a few of the congressmen, you could make a deal on that in ten minutes if you knew what you're doing, because everybody wants to do it. And companies are actually leaving our country to get their money. Not only because our taxes are too high-which we're gonna lower, by the way-but companies are leaving our country in order to go and get money that's their money, because there's no way of bringing it in. So we've got a-we've got a long way to go. But I think at some point it's gonna get done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has been very exciting, this whole process. We started, I was one of 17 people, senators, governors, I've had such great support. Dr. Ben Carson the other day endorsed us.&nbsp;Great guy. Great guy. Wonderful man. And Chris Christie endorsed us, that was so incredible. And today Pam Bondi came up and endorsed us, she was great, and&nbsp;she is a truly wonderful, a truly wonderful woman and the job she's done in Florida is incredible. You know, so many-we've had such incredible support. Paul Ryan called me the other day, tremendous call. I spoke with Mitch McConnell today. We had a great conversation. The fact is, we have to bring our party together. We have to bring it together. We have-We have something happening that actually makes the Republican Party, probably the biggest political story anywhere in the world. Everybody's writing about it, all over Europe, all over the world they're talking about it. Millions of people are coming in to vote. This was an example of it today. Many many more people. I'm looking at the polling booths, I'm looking at different polling booths all around the country, where it's up. And the lines are four, five, six blocks long. And the woman, one woman was in there for 40 years, she's been working the polls. And she said, we'd have two people here, we'd have three people. Now look at the line. And the line looked like it was, you know, long. It was really long. Five deep, and long. And it's just a different thing. We have a great opportunity. And the people that are voting are, Democrats are coming in, Independents are coming in, and very very importantly, people that never voted before. It's an incredible thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want to pay my respects, by the way, to Todd Palin, Sarah's husband. Sarah was here, she was incredible. She was making a speech on my behalf, and fantastic, everybody loves her. And what happened was he was in a very bad accident. He's tough as nails, he's gonna be fine. But I just want to pay my respects, by the way, to Todd and Sarah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, our theme when we started-and Melania and I came down-Yeah, sit down everybody, please. I mean, this is Mar-a-Lago, we give you seats, you don't have to stand.&nbsp;I'm looking at all these people.&nbsp;Cory, good job, Cory. Good job. And Hope and our whole-our whole squad, right? So when this began, Melania and I-and I said, gotta do it, and she was so supportive and she's been so supportive, it's been amazing. And we have to do it. We came down the escalator, and it was about trade and it was about borders. And what happened is, pretty quickly after that, and we were-we shot right up. I shot right to the top of the polls, and have been leading in the polls almost from the beginning, without fail. We went up in June. Most people said I'll never run, he's just gonna have fun, he's having a good time. This isn't necessarily-I mean, I'm having a good time. I would-you know, I'm having a very nice time, but you know what? I'm working very hard. And there is great anger, believe me, there is great anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the broadcasters was saying, is there anger? And I said to him, now see I'm supposed to say no, there's not, we love the way things are working, we love the deal you made with Iran, it's wonderful, you give them $150 billion, we get nothing, we love all the deals, the trade deals are wonderful, you lose $500 billion a year with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, we lost $58 billion a year in terms of-in terms of imbalance. It's a total imbalance. We don't make good deals anymore, we don't win anymore. As a country, we don't win anymore. And they asked, is there anger from your people, there seem to be-&nbsp;And I said, there is anger. They're not angry people. But they want to see the country properly run. They want to see borders, they want to see good healthcare, they want to see things properly taken care of. They want our military rebuilt, our military is in a very bad state. They want it rebuilt.&nbsp;Very very importantly-&nbsp;And they want the Second Amendment, by the way, protected and protected strongly. And that's going to happen. And you know what they want so badly? They want our veterans taken care of. Our veterans are treated so badly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we started, and something happened called Paris. Paris happened, and Paris was a disaster, that was-there've been many disasters, but it was Paris. And then we had a case in Los Angeles where-it was in California where 14 young people were killed. And it just goes on and on and on. And what happened with me is this whole run took on a whole new meaning. Not just borders, not just good trade deals-and we're gonna make the best trade deals you've ever seen, we've got such endorsements from Carl Icahn and the smartest people in business. And these people are going to be negotiating our deals, and they're the best in the world, we have the best business people in the world. They're gonna know-&nbsp;We're gonna have such great deals. We're gonna do so good with trade. We're gonna do so good on the border. But it took on a whole new meaning. And the meaning was very simple. We need protection in our country. And that's gonna happen. And all of a sudden the poll numbers shot up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I'm just very proud to be a part of this. I think we're going to go and we're gonna do a lot of trips over the next month. But I think we're gonna have a great victory. And I think, more importantly than anything else, we're going to start winning again. This country is going to start winning again. We don't win anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't win with our military, we can't beat ISIS. We're gonna knock the hell out of them. We don't win-We don't win at trade, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, everybody, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam, India, name the country, anybody we deal-anybody we do business with beats us. We don't win at trade. We're gonna win at trade. We're gonna make our country rich again. We're gonna make our country great again. And we need the rich in order to make the great, I'm sorry to tell you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So-&nbsp;So I'm going forward. We had a fantastic evening. I would have never thought this could happen. I guess we're waiting for one result, which possibly will be very successful, so-&nbsp;But to win the states that we won and to win by the margins, and especially-look, this is my second home, Florida. To win by that kind of a number is-is incredible. It's record-setting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And-and I have to-&nbsp;And I have to say it, I have to say it that, number one, I want to congratulate Marco Rubio on having run a really tough campaign. He's tough, he's smart, and he's got a great future, he's got a great future.&nbsp;But I have to say-and nobody has ever ever, in the history of politics, received the kind of negative advertising that I have. Record, record, record. It-by the way, mostly false. I wouldn't say 100 percent, but about 90 percent.&nbsp;Mostly false, vicious, horrible. They say it was 18 million the first week, meaning last week, and 25 million and it added up to over $40 million. And you explain it to me because I can't. My numbers went up. I don't understand it. Nobody understands it. My numbers went up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I mean it's been an interesting experience. Last week, Adam Scott won at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Doral, won the big tournament, the world championship of golf. And Adam, who's a great guy, I guess a lot of you folks saw that. But I'm watching, and we have television screens all over and we're down at this gorgeous green at Doral, and everything is working beautifully. And then a commercial comes on, the worst commercial. And I'm with these wonderful people from Cadillac and all these top executives. And I'm saying, look over there, look, don't watch it, no don't-you don't want to watch it. I'm saying, don't-aren't-isn't the grass beautiful? Look. Look, don't watch.&nbsp;And they came in waves, one after another after another. And it was brutal. And then Adam comes and he's this handsome kid from Australia, one of the greatest golfers in the world, made an unbelievable shot on the 18th hole to win the tournament, and he's a great champion. And we're giving the award. And just before-we break for a commercial, we'll be right back with our great champion from Australia, Adam Scott. And here's the commercial and I said NO and it was, two of them. Two of them. Oh what a day that was, what a disaster. What a disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unbelievable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So again I just want to congratulate everybody. This is a really interesting process. It's an amazing process. It's very tough, but it is a-by the end, if you get to the end, you can handle a lot of things, including pressure, that I can tell you, because there's nothing like it. Lies, deceit, viciousness, disgusting reporters, horrible people.&nbsp;Sure. Some are nice. Some are nice. Some-some really disgusting people back there laughed at that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And I just want to say, we're gonna go forward. And we're gonna win. But more importantly we're gonna win for the country. We're gonna win, win, win, and we're not stopping. We're gonna have great victories for our country. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Thank you.</SPAN></P>
