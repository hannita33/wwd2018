<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an election year defined by angry populism, Hillary Clinton made an optimistic economic pitch on Friday, presenting a wide-ranging plan for job growth that would provide incentives for corporations that invest in employees and strip tax benefits from companies that move jobs overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at an auto parts manufacturer in Detroit, days before Michigan holds its Democratic primary, Mrs. Clinton proposed a ''new bargain for the new economy'' that would bring back manufacturing jobs and increase collective bargaining rights. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She unveiled her economic proposal as two other presidential candidates, Senator Bernie Sanders and Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, descended on the state as the campaign entered a new phase, moving to the industrial heartland of the country, where both men are hoping their anti-free trade message resonates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A new ''clawback'' proposal she unveiled would rescind tax relief and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas. This is the latest revision to the corporate tax code Mrs. Clinton has proposed in an effort to create jobs and lift wages, which have been virtually stagnant for 15 years even as the costs of college, child care, housing and health care have soared.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She also reiterated her plan to provide tax incentives for companies that share profits with employees and her proposal to raise the federal minimum wage. Her plan would also place an exit tax on companies that move their headquarters overseas to pay a lower tax rate abroad -- known as inversions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Creating good paying jobs and raising incomes is the defining economic challenge of our time,'' Mrs. Clinton said after touring the state's largest business owned by women, Detroit Manufacturing Systems, which makes plastic assemblies for doors and dashboards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Michigan proves every day that American workers are the best in the world,'' she said. ''Companies have to start treating workers like assets to be investing in, not costs to be cut.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Addressing an audience of labor leaders, local elected officials and autoworkers, Mrs. Clinton singled out companies that she said had received tax benefits as they shipped jobs out of the country. ''They have no problem taking taxpayer dollars with one hand and giving out pink slips with the other,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But unlike Mr. Sanders, her Democratic rival, or Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mrs. Clinton did not espouse a red-hot indictment of the private sector or offer a dire assessment of the state's future. She provided a stark contrast with their messaging, which came on a day in which the government said job growth accelerated in February while wages had stagnated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm not interested in condemning whole categories of businesses or the entire private sector,'' she said. ''But I do want to send a clear message to every boardroom and every executive suite'' that ''if you desert America, you'll pay a price.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The speech was a turning point in the Democratic contest as Mrs. Clinton, who largely relied on the support of minority voters to push her to victories across the South on Super Tuesday, looks to the white, working-class voters in places like Michigan who will vote on Tuesday. Those voters propelled Bill Clinton to the presidency in 1992 and gave Mrs. Clinton a boost in her 2008 campaign, but have since abandoned the party in droves, drawn most recently to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Holding a solid lead in the race for the 2,383 delegates needed to capture the Democratic nomination and facing another debate on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton appeared less inclined to adopt Mr. Sanders's anti-Wall Street message. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This week the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center released analyses of both Democrats' plans to raise taxes, especially on the wealthy and some businesses, to pay for their respective spending initiatives. Mrs. Clinton's plans would raise $1.1 trillion in the first decade to Mr. Sanders's $15.3 trillion, mainly to pay for his proposal for government-run universal health care -- making her tax proposals ''incremental'' by comparison, said Leonard E. Burman, the director of the Tax Policy Center. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Her experience in government and in politics for a long time tells her that those are the kinds of things that she might get done,'' Mr. Burman said. ''Bernie Sanders clearly wants to just change things radically.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is unclear how effective her clawback proposal would be, and whether in the balance of a corporation's business decisions the loss of tax breaks or threat of penalties would tip the scale against moving operations out of the country. The proposal would face an uphill battle in a Congress that will most likely have at least one chamber, the House, still under Republican control after 2016.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton repeatedly alluded to the economic successes of the Clinton administration, when median family income, adjusted for inflation, increased to $56,080 in 1999 from $48,884 in 1993, compared with a decline to $51,017 in 2012 from $55,987 in 2000, according to census data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In the 1990s, we made incomes rise for everyone,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And without mentioning Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by name, she rebuffed his negative assessment of America's prospects. ''I'll tell you, when I hear people running for president who spend all their time bad-mouthing America, it really upsets me,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She named several successful local businesses, like Shinola, a luxury watchmaker, and Ventower Industries, which makes the towers used in wind turbines, as evidence that businesses have played an important part in the economic recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton's optimistic assessment of the economic recovery under President Obama stood in stark contrast to the perspectives of her opponents on both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Before Mrs. Clinton took the lectern, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> greeted a crowd in Warren, to raucous chants of ''Build the wall!'' and delivered a fiery message about taking on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and other nations that devalue their currency to hurt American workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is car country -- rapidly not becoming car country, but we're going to keep it car country,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said. ''If you get laid off on Tuesday, I still want your vote,'' he said. ''I'll get you a new job; don't worry about it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton's address was her most exhaustive yet focused on job creation, and leaned on an economic philosophy called inclusive capitalism that many of the Clintons's closest advisers adhere to. It calls on corporations to invest in employees, communities and the environment rather than relying on short-term profits that increase shareholder value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton criticized companies that are overly dependent on dividends and stock buybacks to reward shareholders. ''That's money they're not using to train their workers or give them a raise,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The approach speaks to Mrs. Clinton's belief that the private sector must be part of the solution, said Gene B. Sperling, an economic adviser in the Clinton and Obama administrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She is quite comfortable offering more tax relief to companies investing long-term in American workers and jobs,'' he said. ''And just as comfortable telling them they are going to face a much tougher tax code when they break their side of the bargain through inversions or short-term cut-and-run strategies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the economic approach of the Bill Clinton years may evoke fond memories for some voters, the policies he and his advisers advanced have also come back to haunt Mrs. Clinton's campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Friday, Mr. Sanders, hoping his populist economic message can help him regain his footing in the Democratic race with a victory in Michigan, held two rallies in the state. He criticized Mrs. Clinton over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Clinton signed in 1993 and has become a symbol of voters' frustration with free trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If the people of Michigan want to make a decision about which candidate stood with workers against corporate America and against these disastrous trade agreements, that candidate is Bernie Sanders,'' he told about 2,000 supporters in Traverse City.</SPAN></P>
