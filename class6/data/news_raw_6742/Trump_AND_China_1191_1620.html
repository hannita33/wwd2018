<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON Labor Day in 1960, John F. Kennedy kicked off the final push of his presidential campaign in Cadillac Square in Detroit with a rousing speech to thousands of United Auto Workers members. It was a nod to the immense clout of organized labor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those days are long gone. Today about 11 percent of American workers belong to unions, down from 31 percent in Kennedy's day. And that powerful autoworkers union? Its membership has plummeted to 400,000 from a peak of 1.5 million in 1979. The declines have been particularly steep in former strongholds like Michigan, which holds its primary on Tuesday, as well as Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin and other Rust Belt states that will hold primaries in the coming month. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With its shrinking ranks, organized labor, which tilts strongly Democratic, was already struggling to compete with Republican-leaning ''super PACs'' financed by wealthy conservatives like the Koch brothers, who have vowed with their allies to spend $889 million on this election. Now the labor movement is being buffeted by another force: Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whose attacks on trade deals, illegal immigrants, Chinese imports and the shifting of jobs overseas are winning over white, blue-collar workers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Can a weakened labor movement still provide the money, voters and get-out-the-vote muscle to elect the Democratic nominee in crucial swing states, as it has in the past?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Democratic strategists point to statistics they say demonstrate labor's continued influence. In union households in Ohio, President Obama beat Mitt Romney in 2012 by 54 percent to 44 percent among white voters without college degrees. But in nonunion households, he lost 39 percent to 59 percent among the same voters. In Wisconsin, the results were similar: Mr. Obama won 60 percent to 38 percent in union households among those voters, but lost in nonunion households 42 percent to 57 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Union voters helped deliver those crucial states to Mr. Obama. For one thing, unions shape their members' economic and political views long term. Just as important, unions mount intense campaigns -- with workplace fliers, phone calls and door-knocking -- to get their members to vote for the labor-backed candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''For the Democratic nominee, the labor movement is the most effective tool after the candidate's own campaign,'' said Steve Rosenthal, a former political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the nation's main union federation. He noted that even in Michigan and Ohio, where union membership is down, labor households still represent nearly a quarter of all voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, whether labor can make as big an effort this year is in question. In Wisconsin, where Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, pushed through legislation that crippled most public-sector unions, membership has fallen 44 percent since 2008, to 223,000 from 396,000. (Just 8.3 percent of Wisconsin's workers are in unions, down from 15 percent in 2008.) Unions have also lost dues money in recent years as Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana and West Virginia have enacted ''right to work'' laws allowing employees to stop paying dues or fees to the unions that represent them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A decade ago, labor's political operation was ''unmatched by anything on the right,'' said Luke Hilgemann, chief executive of Americans for Prosperity, a free-market advocacy group founded by the Koch brothers. ''Now we're spreading the message through the same means.'' The biggest difference, he noted, ''is they have seen their numbers decline and we have seen our numbers skyrocket.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Americans for Prosperity has built a nationwide campaign network based on labor's model. Mr. Hilgemann says this 35-state effort has a staff of 500, enlisted 2.8 million activists and already made 4.5 million phone calls. It remains unclear whether the group will support Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as the Kochs, along with many other conservatives, have criticized the candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some major unions are planning to create their own super PAC. Although it would have far less money than its conservative rivals, such an organization would help labor to finance even more door-to-door outreach, their traditional strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The other side has money, but we have people,'' said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And Michael Podhorzer, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s political director, said: ''All these attacks are creating a more activist culture in unions. There may be a decline in absolute numbers, but the intensity that union members feel has gone up, and so has the recognition that there are huge stakes in this election.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One big issue is the Supreme Court vacancy left by Antonin Scalia's death. With major labor-related cases pending before the court, tipping the balance toward its liberal faction could motivate many union members to turn out for the Democratic candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Labor's task has also been complicated by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose passionate attacks on income inequality, wage stagnation and trade deals have won over many union members. Union leaders, on the other hand, lean heavily toward Hillary Clinton, partly because they see her as a safer bet to win in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a result, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has refrained from endorsing either candidate, although about two dozen national unions, with more than 10 million members, have backed Mrs. Clinton, while just three support Mr. Sanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With Mrs. Clinton having a clearer road to the nomination after Super Tuesday, many Democrats are wondering whether unions can rally Sanders supporters to Mrs. Clinton in November. ''We're going to make it crystal clear to union members, whether Democrats, Republicans, independents or first-time voters, that Hillary Clinton should be their choice,'' said Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Larry Cohen, a former president of the Communications Workers of America union and now a senior Sanders adviser, said it might not be so easy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Hillary will have an issue about enthusiasm, given what's turned up in this campaign,'' he said, predicting that union members would overwhelmingly back the Democratic nominee. Still, he added: ''If Bernie is the candidate, then very few union members will back </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. If Hillary is the candidate, there'll be more.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some labor leaders say the real danger to Mrs. Clinton, at least among working-class voters, is Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Definitely some like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' said Thomas Hanify, president of the Professional Firefighters Union of Indiana. ''They like his upbeat message that we're going to make it good again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He noted Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attacks on trade imbalances and the exodus of manufacturing jobs abroad. Carrier, the air-conditioning manufacturer, announced in February that it would close a large plant in Indiana and move production to Mexico. Mr. Hanify's union has not yet endorsed anyone.</SPAN></P>
