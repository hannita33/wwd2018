</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vs. the news media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition update is grabbing attention for how it was delivered on Monday: an infomercial-style YouTube video laying out his goals for creating jobs. The video underscores how Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may try to navigate around traditional news outlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also met privately with executives and anchors at the major TV networks and was said to have called their campaign coverage dishonest. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has not held a news conference since winning the election, will meet with representatives of The Times today after saying this morning that he would not attend.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Threat to investigate Clinton is dropped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not intend to pursue inquiries into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server or the financial operations at the Clinton Foundation, which he vowed to do during the second presidential debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior adviser said the president elect wanted to &quot;move beyond the issues of the campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President-elect's business dealings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a recent meeting, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> encouraged a British politician to oppose the kind of offshore wind farms that he believes will mar the view from one of his Scottish golf courses, according to a media consultant who was present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, we look at how an obscure provision of the Constitution poses risks for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> if he continues to reap benefits from dealings with companies controlled by foreign governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deadly school bus crash in Tennessee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver was charged with vehicular homicide after at least five children were killed when the bus overturned and hit a tree in Chattanooga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly three dozen elementary school students were on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Displaced in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military campaign to oust the Islamic State from Mosul is in its sixth week. Our photographer and reporter covering the battle focus on an intensifying humanitarian crisis: the thousands of residents trying to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stories of anguish like one from a grief-stricken man searching for his parents are common. &quot;I have not heard from them,&quot; he told our reporter. &quot;I am always crying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> North Dakota pipeline protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In our latest 360 video, a lifelong resident of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation talks about his relationship to the land and the water, and his fear for their future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law enforcement officials defended their recent use of fire hoses against protesters, despite temperatures below freezing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rewriting Olympics history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fallout from revelations of Russia's state-run doping program is altering the record books for the 2008 and 2012 Summer Games, in Beijing and London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The retesting of stored urine samples has incriminated at least 40 medal winners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier we dissected the making of a fake news story. Today, we look at a Washington pizzeria that is reeling from menacing calls and online abuse after fake stories claimed it was a child-trafficking site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's endless,&quot; the owner says of the threats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worried about hacking or surveillance, or both? Here are seven steps to protect your digital life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sabra is recalling some varieties of hummus with a &quot;best before&quot; date of Jan. 23, 2017, or earlier, over listeria concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Life at call centers in India and the Philippines is the subject of a photographer's new project, which opens a window to the world on the other end of the line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How much do they earn? How important is this job for them? Does it help their families or not? I wanted to have answers to this,&quot; he writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. stocks were up on Monday. Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obama to hand out prestigious award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Ellen DeGeneres, Robert De Niro, and Bill and Melinda Gates will be among the 21 Americans receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom today.<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the nation's highest civilian honor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kanye West hospitalized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exhaustion has landed the rapper in the hospital, and he has canceled the remainder of his tour, his representative said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Onstage in Sacramento on Saturday night, Mr. West delivered a long, meandering speech on politics and the music industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In memoriam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">William Trevor, an Irish writer, has died at 88. He focused his mournful, darkly funny short stories and novels on &quot;the sadness of fate.&quot; Here are excerpts from some of his works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Historic gastronomist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarah Lohman may have one of the best jobs in the world. Ms. Lohman searches old cookbooks to recreate forgotten dishes as a way of studying the effects of earlier cooking on modern eating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of her most notable endeavors was drinking like a man in colonial America following accounts that had her slugging whiskey, hard cider and a hot toddy before noon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recipe of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bake a frittata with spicy Italian sausage, broccoli rabe and cheese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ah, the family road trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every country with cars knows the drill, and this week the United States will see some of its busiest traveling days of the year with the Thanksgiving holiday. AAA predicts that 43.5 million Americans will be on the roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What to do as you're going over the river and through the woods to Grandmother's house?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While modern-day comforts, apps and back-of-the-seat screens have made it easier to pass the time while on the road, the games of yesteryear can offer a twinge of nostalgia for adults and a tablet-free option to entertain the kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it's spotting roadside novelties - as in I Spy or Bingo - or vehicles from different states (or countries) - as in the license plate game - most games are variations on a scavenger hunt. (Punch Buggy, which depends on spotting a dwindling supply of old Volkswagen Beetles, could just be an exercise in frustration.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Britain, car snooker adapts the rules of the variant of billiards on which it's based, requiring players to spot vehicles of different colors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, The Times also collected favorite travel games from readers (one is titled &quot;Guess What I Saw&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps in the aftermath of a contentious election, getting to dinner might be more fun than the destination itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Stanford contributed reporting.</SPAN></P>
