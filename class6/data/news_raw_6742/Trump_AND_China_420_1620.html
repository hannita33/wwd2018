<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Even if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> meant everything he said about Putin during the campaign - and that's doubtful - repairing relations is unlikely.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOSCOW - Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shocking triumph in the American presidential election will have some unusual foreign-policy repercussions. During the campaign, Democrats frequently tried to damage Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> standing by claiming that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was working for and supporting the Republican nominee. Now many may believe that America's huge political upset could even be described as a victory for the Kremlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the idea peddled by American news media that Mr. Putin supports Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is far removed from reality. Proponents of this idea have blithely ignored the assessments in mainstream Russian news media and by Russian analysts, which have never been particularly enthusiastic about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a lot of concern in Russia about what will happen to American foreign policy once Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is inaugurated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main problem with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is that no one - including the president-elect himself - seems to know what he will do as president, especially in the area of foreign policy. His statements on foreign relations so far have been confusing and, at times, contradictory. His aides and advisers also appear to have a broad range of conflicting views on America's foreign and defense policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is more, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will have to find an accommodation with the Republican Party establishment. His administration's foreign-policy and defense appointments may well become a bargaining chip in that difficult process. As a result, some very unexpected figures, including outspoken hawks, may be put at the helm of the State Department and the Pentagon. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> own apparent preference is to focus on domestic matters, especially the economy, so he may yet delegate foreign policy and defense to the established Republican elite, which is clearly hostile to Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering all of this, no one in the Kremlin, where people closely follow American politics and intelligence reports, would seriously consider betting on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike much of the American and international news media, Russian analysts and commentators have never underestimated Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Even though he was sometimes compared to Vladimir Zhironovsky, a flamboyant and outspoken Russian populist, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was more often viewed as a strong and charismatic right-of-center leader. Some Russian commentators even reckon he may more resemble Ronald Reagan - a successful president pursuing a tough unilateral line on foreign and domestic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the longer term, however, Moscow can take comfort from some trends in American politics that have been put into stark relief throughout 2016. On foreign policy, both Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign and Bernie Sanders's Democratic primary bid highlighted a renewed American proclivity toward isolationism. Large segments of the American public are tired of endless military campaigns in the Middle East, and weary of the burden of America's foreign commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more important, it has become clear over the past two decades that globalization has not been such an unalloyed boon for the United States as some wish to portray it. In fact, it is the industrial heartland of America that has borne the brunt of the displacement caused by the breakneck globalization advocated by the Washington elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key question now is whether America's nascent isolationism will translate into policy. Even if it does, it won't happen soon. The American political elite remains almost universally interventionist and supportive of globalization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, as Russia tries to figure out what to expect from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency, it has very little reason to hope that the new president will offer any major concessions or strike any major deals with Moscow, regardless of what he said during the campaign. And Moscow has very little to offer to Washington at the moment. There are few areas for possible cooperation. Even if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does want to improve relations with Russia, he will find out when he moves into the Oval Office that the United States has little to gain from such an improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is why there is no reason to expect - either now, or in the foreseeable future - that America and Russia will strike some grand deal to divide the world into spheres of influence. Even more modest compromises seem unlikely. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration will have no incentive to make overtures to Moscow, such as taking a softer stance on Ukraine or easing the sanctions on Russia. Besides, for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> any softening toward Russia would face opposition from within the Republican Party and in the American foreign policy and defense communities. The new president is unlikely to be willing to pay the steep domestic political price, especially since improving relations offers no tangible benefits to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basic problems in Russian-American relations stem from Moscow's fundamental aspiration to return to the global arena as a great power, and even to contemplate integration into the American-led, pro-Western world order only on the condition of being recognized as a great power that dominates most of its former Soviet neighbors. These Russian aspirations will remain unacceptable to any American administration for years, if not decades, to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's only one way this could change, though it is a scenario that many Americans may find uncomfortable to contemplate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the event of further major deterioration of America's positions in the global arena - for example, if the United States is dragged into a confrontation with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> while remaining mired in the Middle East - Russia may look like a more appealing ally, or at least a less appealing adversary. A confrontation with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and other foreign-policy complications, might force Washington to seek a rapprochement with Russia, in the same way that rivalry with Germany had once forced the British Empire to put aside its longstanding differences with Russia and sign a pact in 1907. But for this scenario to come to pass, Moscow will have to remain firm and unyielding for as long as it takes.</SPAN></P>
