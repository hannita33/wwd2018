<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> victories on Super Tuesday, his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination made him a frequent target during their 11th debate, held Thursday night in Detroit. A closer look at the accuracy of some of their claims, and his:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senator Marco Rubio of Florida claimed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inherited more than $100 million. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  PROBABLY NOT THAT MUCH Mr. Rubio has repeatedly asserted that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not really as self-made as he has made it seem, saying Thursday that he received an inheritance of at least $100 million. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has called that claim far overstated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is undeniable that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inherited quite a bit of money from his father, Fred </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sr., who was in the real estate business, but it is unclear exactly how much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In January, The New York Times reported that at the release of Fred </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will, ''the bulk of the inheritance, at least $20 million,'' was to be divided among Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his siblings and their descendants. STEVE EDER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> says he has beaten Hillary Clinton in many general election polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  JUST THE OPPOSITE In response to Mr. Rubio's claim that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the only candidate who consistently loses to Mrs. Clinton in national polls of a hypothetical general election, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> retorted that he has beaten Mrs. Clinton plenty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to a handy list of polling data compiled by the website Real Clear Politics, Mrs. Clinton has beaten Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in virtually every one of them dating back to May. It is true, though, that her lead over Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has diminished since July. JONATHAN MAHLER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rubio said two-thirds of the votes cast to date have gone against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  THE NUMBERS ADD UP Fifteen states have held Republican nominating contests thus far, and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has received about 3.4 million votes out of the 9.8 million that have been cast. Though Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been the leading vote-getter, those numbers mean about 66 percent, or two-thirds, have voted for others. THOMAS KAPLAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said ''every other country we do business with, we are getting absolutely crushed on trade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NOT EVERY COUNTRY The United States has indeed been dealing with consistent overall trade deficits for decades, and in recent years, the biggest were with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japan, Germany and Mexico. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the United States records trade surpluses with some countries and territories, including Hong Kong, the Netherlands, the United Arab Emirates and Australia, according to the Census Bureau. And last year, it ran a trade surplus with Canada for the first time since 1990. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  MEGAN TWOHEY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas claimed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> repeatedly donated to Mrs. Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  HE DID, OVER AND OVER As he challenged Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> conservative credentials, Mr. Cruz said the businessman had donated to Mrs. Clinton 10 times over the years, including four checks to her 2008 presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Campaign finance records back up Mr. Cruz, though one of the presidential donations was ultimately refunded. STEVE EDER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gov. John Kasich of Ohio said he held 200 town hall-style meetings in New Hampshire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NOT THAT MANY Mr. Kasich focused intently on New Hampshire, and he was prolific with his events there. But he inflated the number of town hall-style meetings, in which he takes questions from the audience, that he held in the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His total count for town halls topped 100, but not by much. He celebrated what his campaign said was his 100th town hall on Feb. 5, just four days before the state's primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kasich did make other kinds of appearances in New Hampshire that are not included in that tally. A count by New England Cable News put him at 190 total campaign stops. THOMAS KAPLAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Mr. Rubio had the ''No. 1 absentee record'' in the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NOT AN EXAGGERATION Mr. Rubio has previously faced criticism during the campaign for missing Senate votes. That is not unusual for a senator running for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is correct in saying that Mr. Rubio has been the worst offender among current senators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Senate has held 370 roll call votes since the beginning of 2015, and Mr. Rubio has missed 148 of them, or 40 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The second-worst offender is Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a former presidential candidate, who has missed 30 percent of the votes in that period. Mr. Cruz is next on the absenteeism list, having missed 29 percent. </SPAN></P>
