</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contempt that Hillary Clinton and Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> express for each other will continue to play out in vitriolic sound bites. But their profound differences on what to do about the economy and the struggling middle class are far more important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''This election will be won by whichever candidate convinces middle-class voters they are better for their jobs and future prospects,'' said Stephen Moore, an economist at the Heritage Foundation and an adviser to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gene B. Sperling, a leading economic official under President Bill Clinton and President Obama, and an adviser to Mrs. Clinton, said, ''This is about whether economic forces hollow out the middle class or whether those forces strengthen the middle class, creating jobs and higher wages.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the economy has recovered from the 2008 crisis, the unemployment rate has shrunk to less than half of what it was eight years ago and wages have started to rise. But median average family income, in real dollars, is less than it was 10 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the issue voters say is their top concern, the two presumptive nominees offer radically different remedies. Mrs. Clinton goes out of her way to show that most of her initiatives are paid for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in defiance of Republican orthodoxy, seems unfazed by debt. He proudly says that borrowing fueled his business ventures and has even suggested that as president, he might try to negotiate down American debt obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mrs. Clinton's agenda includes calls for a higher minimum wage, 12 weeks' paid leave for chronically ill workers and parents with a newborn, more funds for job training and education, especially higher education, and a $275 billion infrastructure plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She would raise taxes by $1.1 trillion over the next decade, the Tax Policy Center estimates. These raises are mainly aimed at wealthier Americans and include higher capital gains taxes on assets held for longer periods, a larger estate tax for wealthy heirs, and closing some corporate loopholes and advantages enjoyed by hedge fund and private equity executives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These increases will be offset, however, by a subsequent middle-class tax cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, by contrast, has offered huge tax cuts, which policy experts estimate will cost $9 trillion to $11 trillion over a decade. He also vows to end or soften many federal regulations, which he calls job killers. Look for him to focus on a pro-growth energy policy that his camp calculates would split two of Mrs. Clinton's important constituencies: labor and environmentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the core of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proposals for job creation involves getting tough on trade by renegotiating previous treaties and imposing heavy duties on imports, particularly from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or Mexico. Although international laws and the need for congressional approval could inhibit such actions, a president does have flexibility to impose some trade sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the coming months, each candidate will be pressed to provide more specifics; Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been especially vague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has delegated two advocates of supply-side tax cuts to revise his plan to make it less costly. One of them, Mr. Moore of the Heritage Foundation, says the objective is to cut the projected deficit by at least two-thirds, to around $3 trillion over a decade. This, he says, would be achieved primarily by limiting deductions for upper-income taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Sperling suggests that a middle-class tax cut, higher education and a larger infrastructure plan ''are candidates for expansion'' by Mrs. Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Until more specifics are forthcoming, it is difficult to gauge the economic impact of either candidate's plans. Several economic analyses, including those by Moody's Analytics and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have estimated that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> plans, primarily because they rely on protectionism, deportation of undocumented workers and debt, would throw the economy into a recession. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rejects that contention and says that he would create growth of 6 percent a year, a level last achieved in 1983.</SPAN></P>
