<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hardly a day goes by that President Rodrigo Duterte fails to come up with some new way to poison the relationship between the Philippines and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the Philippines began annual joint military exercises with the Americans, but Mr. Duterte has threatened that this will be the last time. He has also favorably compared his extrajudicial killings of drug addicts to the Holocaust, drawing so much condemnation that he later apologized. Still, the allusion suggested a new wave of vigilante deaths to come, on top of the more than 1,300 victims tallied so far. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Riding high in the polls, Mr. Duterte, a bullying leader with a vulgar mouth and volatile temperament, has been compared to Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and seems determined to shake up Filipino foreign policy as much as domestic policy. In so doing he could undermine not only relations with the United States but, more broadly, stability in Asia, which is already threatened by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> increasingly aggressive efforts to assert control over most of the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has a long history with the Philippines, a former colony that became independent in 1946 and signed a mutual defense treaty with Washington in 1951. The relationship has had its ups and downs, including controversy over two key naval bases that lately have been reopened to American forces. With the Obama administration rebalancing American interests in Asia as a counterweight to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the relationship with the Philippines is more important than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the three short months since he took office, Mr. Duterte has called President Obama a ''son of a bitch,'' threatened to evict American special operations forces training Filipino troops to fight terrorists on the southern island of Mindanao, and hinted at new alliances with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This could all be bluster. Mr. Duterte's senior aides have assured American officials that nothing will change, and so far there has been no effort to remove the special forces. And despite Mr. Duterte's flirtation with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Beijing is still blocking Filipino fishermen from their traditional waters in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. The Philippine peso has fallen, and credit rating agencies have warned that they could soon downgrade the country's creditworthiness. Some American lawmakers, meanwhile, have suggested cutting aid to Manila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So far, the Obama administration has held fast, reaffirming its commitment to the alliance while issuing statements against Mr. Duterte's violation of the rule of law and disregard of human rights. It is not an easy situation to manage, however, given Mr. Duterte's volatility and erratic ways. The hope is that in time he will temper his ideas. But a lot of damage could be done to his country and its ties to America in the meantime.</SPAN></P>
