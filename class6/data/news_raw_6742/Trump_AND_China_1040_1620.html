</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YAHOO IS SAID TO COLLECT FINAL BIDS Final bids for Yahoo's core internet business are due Monday, Vindu Goel and Michael J. de la Merced report in DealBook. The board is set to make a decision soon afterward, according to people briefed on the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sale of the business, which includes Yahoo's search, email, advertising and media operations, brings an end to a largely unsuccessful effort to turn around the company, and several rounds of bidding, during which Yahoo's business has continued to deteriorate. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bidders include the telecommunications giants Verizon Communications and AT&amp;T, several private equity firms and a Quicken Loans co-founder, Dan Gilbert, who is getting financial backing from Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. The offers will vary depending what assets are included, but Wall Street expects the business to fetch as much as $6 billion, including intellectual property and land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several bidders acknowledged that they had run into what one called &quot;hairy&quot; issues, but no deal breakers have emerged so far. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sale has, however, been slowed by some unpleasant revelations about expensive decisions made by Marissa Mayer, the chief executive. The biggest surprise was Yahoo telling bidders in June that they could be on the hook for more than $1 billion in immediate payments to Mozilla, which makes the Firefox web browser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2014, Yahoo promised to pay Mozilla at least $375 million a year to make Yahoo the default search engine on Firefox - about $100 million more than Google was paying for similar prominent, according to Yahoo and Mozilla filings. Ms. Mayer personally negotiated a provision that gave Mozilla unusual leverage to demand all remaining payments upfront if Yahoo were sold, according to people briefed on the terms of the contract. Mozilla would have to show that the change in Yahoo's ownership was hurting the Mozilla brand and degrading the search experience, said people briefed on the terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Any winning bidder would be under pressure to continue Ms. Mayer's heavy investments in search, which she championed despite the long odds of success against Google.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bidders are also trying to determine how much they have to pay out in severance if they cut staff. Ms. Mayer and the board have handed out hefty stock awards to keep Yahoo employees from jumping ship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FIRMS OFFER TO HELP NEW LAWYERS PAY STUDENT DEBT Law firms are starting to contribute cash to help their newly hired lawyers meet monthly payments on education loans that can be as large as a mortgage payment on a house, Elizabeth Olson reports in DealBook. Some law firms already help their junior lawyers refinance with lower-interest loans, but others are going a step further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe, a large firm founded in San Francisco that specializes in technology, energy and infrastructure law, plans to announce on Friday that it will contribute a monthly amount to its new associates to offset accumulated education debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other firms are beginning to embrace the idea, too, seeing debt as a big worry for their entry-level lawyers. Ward and Smith, a 91-person regional law firm based in New Bern, N.C., is introducing a similar student loan repayment benefit to help its new lawyers tackle their debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ward and Smith is working with Gradifi Inc., a Boston company that tailors student loan payment programs for companies and, increasingly, for law firms. Tim DeMello, the founder and chief executive of Gradifi, said that an additional 20 law firms are looking at starting the benefit this year. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More firms are likely to adopt this benefit because they need to compete to attract and retain lawyers and to present themselves in ways that attract and retain clients,&quot; said Jack Zaremski, founder and president of Hanover Legal Personnel Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies in other sectors, like the mutual fund giant Fidelity and the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers already have loan repayment programs to attract and retain millennial employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orrick is offering $100 a month for starting lawyers for 18 months. After that, the junior lawyers will be eligible to receive a bonus from the firm. The program, which starts Sept. 1, is being offered to associates who are on the track to becoming partners as well as to those who choose the less intensive career associate track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's pretty rare that someone comes here with no debt,&quot; said Siobhan A. Handley, Orrick's chief talent officer, who worked with Social Finance Inc. to devise the firm's tuition benefit. &quot;With fewer students choosing law schools, fewer law school grads choosing big firms, and women leaving the profession faster than men, we wanted to distinguish ourselves in the market,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Graduates arrive at law firms with an average of $185,000 in student debt, compared with $75,000 a decade ago, Mark Kantrowitz, a higher-education expert who tracks student debt, estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The programs are not without drawbacks. Law firm contributions are taxed as earnings and economists point out that they benefit one class of employees, the debtors, over others. They also draw from the same employee benefit pool that could be used to augment other benefits like health insurance.<BR> ON THE AGENDA Citigroup and Wells Fargo will publish their second-quarter results at 8 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BAYER RAISES BID FOR MONSANTO The German industrial giant Bayer raised its all-cash takeover bid for Monsanto on Thursday, Michael J. de la Merced reports in DealBook. It increased its offer to $125 a share from $122 a share. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bayer's new offer - still the largest takeover bid by a German company - comes after weeks of discussions between the two companies. Monsanto rejected Bayer's initial bid and has held discussions with another big chemical maker, BASF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are convinced that this transaction is the best opportunity available to provide Monsanto shareholders with highly attractive, immediate and certain value,&quot; Werner Baumann, Bayer's chief executive, said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bayer said its offer was not subject to financing, with loans that would be provided by five major banks. It also proposed a $1.5 billion breakup fee if the merger ran afoul of government regulators. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two companies operate on separate sides of the agriculture business - Monsanto is known for its genetically modified crop seeds, while Bayer makes pesticides and aspirin - but regulators may scrutinize the deal closely to see if it would put more pricing pressure on farmers. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monsanto said it would review the new offer. Shares of Monsanto were up 2.3 percent in midday trading on Thursday, though at $103.55 they were still well below the offer, suggesting some investor skepticism.<BR>Contact  amie.tsang@nytimes.com<BR>MERGERS &amp; ACQUISITIONS &raquo;</SPAN></P>
