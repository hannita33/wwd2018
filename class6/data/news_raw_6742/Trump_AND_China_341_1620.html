</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Get used to the sound of that, my environment-oriented friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this end times for environmental progress or, more specifically, climate progress?<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bad news about climate change is, in a way, the good news: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main&nbsp;forces determining emission levels of heat-trapping carbon dioxide will be just as much out of President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hands as they were out of President Obama's. The decline in the United States has mainly been due to market forces shifting electricity generation from coal to abundant and cheaper natural gas, along with environmental regulations built around the traditional basket of pollutants that even conservatives agreed were worth restricting. (Efficiency and gas-mileage standards and other factors have helped, too, of course.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the unrelenting rise in greenhouse-gas emissions in developing countries is propelled by an unbending reality identified way back in 2005 by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, when he said, &quot;The blunt truth about the politics of climate change is that no country will want to sacrifice its economy in order to meet this challenge.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, as well, other fundamental forces will continue to drive polluted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and smog-choked India to move away from unfettered coal combustion as a path to progress. An expanding middle class is already demanding cleaner air and sustainable transportation choices - just as similar forces enabled pollution cleanups in the United States in the last century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why the Paris Agreement on climate change will continue to register progress on emissions and investments in clean energy or climate resilience, but only within the limits of what nations already consider achievable (as others will be explaining in detail because the first post-Paris round of negotiations is under way right now in Marrakech).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long ago, Jesse Ausubel, a veteran Rockefeller University analyst of global resource and environmental trends, asserted that, &quot;in general, politicians are pulling on disconnected levers&quot; at the intersection of energy and environmental policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In climate arena, politicians mostly pull on &quot;disconnected levers&quot; (Ausubel @RockefellerUniv) http://t.co/5RLHMB6CYh http://t.co/CnxnP8aZVf</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Andy Revkin (@Revkin)16 Dec 14</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I wrote in 2014, that doesn't mean environmental agendas by politicians are useless, and environmentalism remains vital as a result. But what approach is most workable, particularly under a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration with Congress in Republican control?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is it end times for 20th-century-style us-them environmentalism?<BR><BR>That's up to the movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One response to a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency will be to double down with more pipeline blockades and other efforts to &quot;keep it [carbon] in the ground.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not saying there's no utility there. As I wrote on Monday, the Dakota Access Pipeline actions have brought much-needed attention to some longstanding grievances of Native Americans, including the diversion of environmental risks from the neighborhoods of more empowered constituencies onto Sioux lands and waterways. And revealing, and pressing, the banks financing&nbsp;the pipeline project is great.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But timing matters. Thinking ahead, for example, to the next congressional race, in 2018, I'd recommend avoiding the tactics used by those who tried to make the Standing Rock action as much about climate and carbon as Native American justice. With that in mind, I think it's worth including a section I cut from my Monday post - a section&nbsp;I held off running at the time following Mark Twain's dictum about the value of &quot;unsent letters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The section dealt with Bill McKibben's message in an Op-Ed article in The Times explaining &quot;Why Dakota is the New Keystone.&quot; I felt it was a mistake for McKibben (an old friend from decades spent in parallel, but divergent, tracks on climate change) and others to make this a green litmus test for Hillary Clinton:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the final hours of an incredibly consequential presidential race in which every vote - centrist or liberal - will play an important role, I was discouraged to see him use this moment to criticize Hillary Clinton's campaign for &quot;ugly silence&quot; in not jumping to the ramparts on this.<BR>Is there any logic to this at the end of an extraordinarily divisive campaign in which polls are tightening? Let me know if you see it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late last week, the pressure from the left did elicit a response from the Clinton campaign, which was predictably, and woefully, parsed, as Evelyn Nieves describes in The Nation today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is forcing that statement a victory?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should this have been made an Election Day issue?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I guess we'll find out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We just found out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course Clinton's defeat was a devastating political death of a thousand cuts - many self inflicted, others not. But this strategy of the green left was surely in the mix because it negated real concerns of working people facing economic uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obama recognized the importance of taking such concerns into account in hist great &quot;South By South Lawn&quot; climate conversation with the scientist Katharine Hayhoe and the actor and activist Leonardo DiCaprio:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think it is important for those of us who care deeply about this - and Katharine is a wonderful example of the right way to do it - to not be dismissive of people's concerns when it comes to what will this mean for me and my family. Right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So if you're a working-class family, and dad has to drive 50 miles to get to his job, and he can't afford to buy a Tesla or a Prius, and the most important thing to him economically to make sure he can pay the bills at the end of the month is the price of gas, and when gas prices are low that means an extra 100 bucks in his pocket, or 200 bucks in his pocket, and that may make the difference about whether or not he can buy enough food for his kids - if you just start lecturing him about climate change and what's going to happen to the planet 50 years from now, it's just not going to register. [Watch the video here.]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what do environment-minded citizens, including journalists, do next?<BR></SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's plenty to do, much of which is continuing lines of effort that are already under way - as with communities and organizations and media identifying a host of problems, from Volkswagen's cheating to continuing leakage of methane from &quot;super-emitter&quot; sources in our oil and gas infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll be trying to do what I've done for a very long time - hold people in power accountable for actions or inactions that can result in harm or betterment. There are green glimmers amid the most polarizing sound bites of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign. One came in his responses to the questions posed by the Science Debate organization:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perhaps we should be focused on developing energy sources and power production that alleviates the need for dependence on fossil fuels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's a statement I plan to hold him accountable on. I wrote on it in my piece on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> choice to run the transition at the Environmental Protection Agency - Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night, I sent Ebell a note asking for his new contact information. I'll be getting in touch as soon as he's up and running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's another answer </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> team provided to the Science Debate folks:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">[T]he federal government should encourage innovation in the areas of space exploration and investment in research and development across the broad landscape of academia. Though there are increasing demands to curtail spending and to balance the federal budget, we must make the commitment to invest in science, engineering, healthcare and other areas that will make the lives of Americans better, safer and more prosperous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'll be keeping track on that front, as well, given the critical role invigorated basic research will have in accelerating a transition from the fuels of convenience to clean-energy choices that can work not only here, but everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Postscripts | First, keep in mind that I've restricted my comments here to environmental policies. I'm as troubled as anyone else seeking a welcoming, equitable, informed and enterprising America in what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rhetoric has fueled and could do going forward&nbsp;if not modulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Here's the latest Warm Regards podcast, focused on the implications of the election, laying out heartfelt concerns of a climate researcher (Jacquelyn Gill of the University of Maine), a deeply concerned meteorologist (Eric Holthaus) and yours truly:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Gary W. Yohe, an economist at Wesleyan long focused on energy and climate, noted another important factor that will limit </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> options and offer environmentalists a powerful prod:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should be noted that carbon emissions were identified as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act (that was passed by Congress under the Nixon Administration and amended under Clinton). This finding was confirmed by the Supreme Court. All three branches of the federal government therefore agree that the Administration, through the E.P.A. must, by law, do as much as it can to reduce emissions to reduce damages and minimize human health risks. This is what the Obama Administration has been doing. Were the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Administration to ignore this legal imperative, it would be sued by the E.D.F., the Nature Conservancy, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and/or.... for being derelict in meeting their statutory obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Read Brad Plumer's analysis at Vox for some more on both the concern side and the hope side - ignoring the awful headline, which doesn't reflect what he wrote. (this was the hopeful tweet):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, the climate fight is *not* yet lost altogether. There are reasons for hope, too. https://t.co/Feop2e7wJo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- brad plumer (@bradplumer)9 Nov 16</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Tom Yulsman of the University of Colorado, Boulder, journalism program, posted this:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Andy Revkin (@Revkin)9 Nov 16</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- David Roberts at Vox worries that &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election marks the end of any serious hope of limiting climate change to 2 degrees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Here's a good piece by Joe Romm at Climate Progress noting that the trend away from coal is relentless, while the prospects for cabinet appointments and science funding are dire. The tweet has an early version of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;first 100 days&quot; vision:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> go down in history as the man who pulled the plug on a livable climate? Good Romm @climateprogress post... https://t.co/eajWOwuT2n</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Andy Revkin (@Revkin)9 Nov 16</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Stavins, a Harvard economist focused on energy and climate, wrote a short piece for The Times listing the many steps </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can take to undo Obama's administrative steps, but noted a glaring inconsistency in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> own pledges:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the campaign trail, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> promised to &quot;bring back&quot; the coal industry by cutting environmental regulations. That may not be so easy. The decline of that industry and related employment has been caused by technological changes in mining, and competition from low-priced natural gas for electricity generation, not by environmental regulations. At the same time, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has pledged to promote fracking for oil and gas, but that would make natural gas even more economically attractive, and accelerate the elimination of coal-sector jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moving from sound bites to concrete steps may be </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> biggest challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Paul Voosen at Science Magazine's news side does a good job summarizing what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can do here: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sobering Paul @voooos roundup of ways #potusTrump could undermine climate action from #UNFCCC to cabinet level. https://t.co/Kt4XFdLznN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Andy Revkin (@Revkin)10 Nov 16</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And now David Roberts and Brad Plumer have posted a super-sobering list of areas in which Republicans, both in Congress and the White House, can muck things up - particularly if Senate Democrats can't retain filibuster power:</SPAN></P>
