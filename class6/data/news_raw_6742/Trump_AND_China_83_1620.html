<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- The Chinese military, in a move analysts described as a challenge to President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strident criticism of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, has deployed an aircraft carrier to patrol the contested South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, officials said on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ship, which is known as the Liaoning and is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first and only aircraft carrier, was spotted leading five other Chinese warships this week in patrols near the coasts of Taiwan and Japan. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> claims the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea as its own despite objections from neighboring countries and the United States. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chinese military experts called the deployment of the Liaoning a long-overdue challenge to American military dominance in the Pacific. Several said the move appeared aimed at testing Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has antagonized Beijing with acerbic words and actions on issues like Taiwan, trade and North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The message is: 'If you test our bottom line, we'll play that game too,''' said Ni Lexiong, a naval expert at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The decision by Beijing to deploy the carrier group seemed likely to complicate an increasingly fractious relationship between </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Nowhere are those tensions more on display than in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, where American forces have resisted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> efforts to build artificial islands and military outposts as part of its efforts to assert greater control over the sea, a major commercial waterway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the weeks since Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election, Beijing has increased pressure on the United States, placing weapons on disputed islands and seizing an underwater United States Navy drone from international waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chinese officials appear to be emboldened by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> pledge to focus on domestic issues and his ambivalence toward the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> principle, an understanding between the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that has underpinned relations for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The mission is to signal to neighbors that Beijing will set the security table in East Asian waters, and that not even President Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can reverse that trend,'' Patrick M. Cronin, a senior director at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank, said in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chinese officials played down the significance of the Liaoning's journey, saying the ships were taking part in annual training exercises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Liaoning aircraft carrier is entitled to the freedom of navigation and overflight under international law,'' Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a news conference on Monday. ''We hope that all parties will respect this.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials in Taiwan and Japan said that the warships were spotted patrolling their coasts over the past several days. Taiwanese officials said the Liaoning came within 90 nautical miles of the southern tip of the island before entering the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea. Japanese officials said the ships were seen near the shores of Okinawa, in the Pacific Ocean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many people in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cheered the deployment of the Liaoning, a discarded vessel bought from Ukraine in 1998 and refurbished by the Chinese Navy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the Liaoning lacks the capabilities of its American counterparts, it is a symbol of national pride for the government, which is in the midst of an effort to vastly upgrade its military capacity to meet its ambition of projecting strength far from Beijing. Officials have announced plans for a second aircraft carrier and other high-tech weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some commentators in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seized the moment to call on officials to send the Liaoning closer to American shores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Aircraft carriers are strategic tools which should be used to show </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> strength to the world and shape the outside world's attitude toward </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' an editorial in Global Times, a state-run newspaper that often adopts a nationalistic tone, said on Sunday. ''As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> only aircraft carrier fleet now, it should have the ability and courage to sail further.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Department of Defense declined to directly address </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> movements in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We continue to observe a range of ongoing Chinese military activity in the region,'' Cmdr. Gary Ross, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement on Tuesday. ''The United States recognizes the rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all countries in accordance with international law.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Taiwan, officials called for caution. Many residents worry that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is seeking to punish Taiwan for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> actions. He surprised officials in Beijing when he took a call from President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, breaking from decades of diplomatic practice. More recently, he suggested he might abandon the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> principle, prompting sharp rebukes from Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a speech on Tuesday, Taiwan's defense minister, Feng Shih-kuan, spoke about the dangers facing the island and urged more training for Taiwanese soldiers. ''The threat of our enemies is growing day by day,'' he said, according to Reuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> looks to expand its power in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, some experts argue that it risks antagonizing nearby countries, potentially pushing them to form stronger alliances with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''As </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military power grows, the fear is that so, too, will its appetite for regional hegemony,'' said Mr. Cronin of the Center for a New American Security. ''Thus </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coercion will impose yet new costs on Beijing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, others note </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ability to win allies in the region through its economic might, and they point to the shifting allegiances of countries like the Philippines, an American ally that has warmed up to Beijing in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Xu Guangyu, a retired major general in the People's Liberation Army, said </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision to deploy aircraft carriers in faraway waters and to expand its military were natural developments for a country of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''People in other countries should rest assured that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will not interfere in other country's affairs like the U.S.,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
