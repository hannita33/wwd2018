<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Alarmed by Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> grip on the Republican presidential nomination, world leaders are wrestling with the possibility that, even if he loses the general election, his ascent reflects a strain of American public opinion that could profoundly reshape the way the United States addresses security alliances and trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul to the headquarters of NATO in Brussels and the vulnerable Baltic nations along Russia's western border, officials and analysts said in interviews that they saw the success of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''America first'' platform as a harbinger of pressure for allies to pay up or make trade concessions in return for military protection. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In many capitals, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> formal and off-the-cuff foreign policy proposals -- his threat to pull out of NATO; his musings about removing the United States' nuclear umbrella over Japan and South Korea; his pledge to slap huge trade tariffs on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- are regarded with a mix of alarm and confusion. Asked on Thursday if Beijing was concerned about the prospect of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, replied, ''We hope the U.S. people from all walks of life would view bilateral relations from a reasonable and objective perspective.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stefano Stefanini, a former representative of Italy to NATO and former diplomatic adviser to the Italian president, put it this way: ''There is no Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contingency plan.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The mistake that Europe might make is to think the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> phenomenon might just fade away,'' Mr. Stefanini said. ''The sentiments that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is expressing will certainly influence the next administration or the next Congress.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials do not see Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rise as merely an American version of the anti-immigration and isolationist parties that have picked up support across Europe. They are finding signs of tangible political change in statements by Democratic leaders, as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Already, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> assertive positions about American interests have led some officials to look again at President Obama's recent critique of European and Persian Gulf allies as ''free riders.'' They have also helped shed light abroad on the domestic political forces at play around Hillary Clinton's decision to renounce her support for a new Asian trade deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some, too, are revisiting the words of Robert M. Gates in his last weeks as defense secretary in 2011. Mr. Gates warned that a new generation of Americans with no memory of the Cold War would eventually ask whether NATO, the central institution of European security, was an artifact, like the single segment of the Berlin Wall that remains standing as a reminder of the past. In Europe last month, Mr. Obama pressed allies to live up to commitments to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, a benchmark that few have hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Some of the claims made during the campaign have been empty or just wrong,'' said Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to the United States, where he was regarded as one of the savviest analysts of American-European relations. ''There is no 'better Iran nuclear deal,' and not many people think it is a good idea for South Korea or Japan to acquire nuclear weapons.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''But others should give us Europeans pause for thought,'' he said. ''NATO members need to reflect on whether it's right, or sustainable, for the U.S. to pay over 70 percent of the bill for our collective security, or how to ensure we take care of the losers as well as the winners in global free trade.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clearly, many European policy makers were already upset with Mr. Obama's reluctance to intervene on their behalf in conflicts where they have national interests, and with his demand that European nations put what he called, in an interview with The Atlantic, more ''skin in the game.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Europeans cite the United States' reluctance to take the lead in ousting Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi from Libya, an operation that revealed major flaws in NATO operations. And they are unconvinced by Mr. Obama's insistence that he made the right decision in backing away from the ''red line'' he had drawn over the use of chemical weapons by President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Over all, I would say there are too many signs of American retrenchment and retreat,'' said Anders Fogh Rasmussen, a former prime minister of Denmark who was NATO secretary general until 2014. Europeans, he said, would generally prefer an American president ''who will demonstrate determined American leadership,'' even as, to many analysts, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rise suggests pressure for the nation to turn inward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rasmussen said he saw Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> demands on NATO as an acceleration of the Obama administration's effort to encourage more burden sharing. But they come with an isolationist twist, he said. The ''America first'' term, embraced by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in a recent interview with The New York Times, goes back to a movement led by Charles A. Lindbergh in the 1930s to keep America out of war in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The European reaction to the revival of that term has been so sharp that American military leaders, while reluctant to get involved in the campaign, have tried to take on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> arguments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, who just stepped down as the supreme allied commander for Europe, wrote in The Washington Post this week that when he assumed his position in 2013, he thought that arguments about NATO's utility were ''without merit, and there was no need to engage.'' Now, he said, without naming Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, he felt compelled ''to explain to my fellow countrymen why the United States absolutely needs NATO -- a NATO that is strong, resilient and united.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Five members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff made a similar set of arguments at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Tuesday, also avoiding any mention of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But to many who live on Russia's raw border, especially in the Baltic nations in Moscow's shadow, there is nothing more puzzling than Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reluctance to criticize President Vladimir V. Putin. He has often spoken admiringly of Mr. Putin, saying he respects his strength and views him as someone with whom he can negotiate. To European ears, that sounds as if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> may be playing into Mr. Putin's hands, opening a rift within NATO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Russia's enthusiasm about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> seems to be predicated on the assumption that he may actually withdraw forces from Europe,'' said Matthew Rojansky, the director of the Kennan Institute, a Washington research group focused on Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That is exactly the fear of others in a region where NATO is the only bulwark against Russia and where some people doubt that an American president would really commit forces to protect them in times of conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Russia's intervention in Ukraine, ''a lot of Latvians woke up and said, 'Thank God we are in NATO,''' said Lolita Cigane, a member of the Latvian Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In neighboring Lithuania, a plaque at Town Hall in the capital, Vilnius, commemorates a 2002 visit by another Republican, President George W. Bush. ''Anyone who would choose Lithuania as an enemy has also made an enemy of the United States of America,'' Mr. Bush said then. Mr. Obama made a similar vow in Estonia and increased NATO's presence in Eastern Europe in response to the Russian threat, and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> position feels like backpedaling to people in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> argument that Seoul and Tokyo, which host tens of thousands of American troops, need to pay more or see the troops leave bewildered officials in those countries. Japan pays roughly $2 billion a year toward the troops' housing, and military leaders often say it would be more costly for American taxpayers to base those same troops in Guam or in the mainland United States. Moreover, those bases are critical for daily intelligence gathering on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American military officials and diplomats argue that these ''forward deployed'' bases are critical to maintaining freedom of navigation and deterring North Korea. But Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> argues that they are worth it only if they do not cost the United States a fortune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think the real subliminal message </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is saying is this: The U.S. can afford to survive and prosper without any allies if it was forced to cut off all ties, but the converse isn't true,'' said Chung Min Lee, a professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul. He added that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was forcing allies ''to come up with convincing elevator speeches on the key benefits they bring to the U.S., and thus far, none of them have done so.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a frequent target of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> criticism, he is widely viewed as a pragmatist who is less hawkish and less focused on human rights than Mrs. Clinton is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His proposal to impose high taxes on Chinese goods receives little attention there, and his talk of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''raping'' the United States in unfair trade deals has been met with shrugs, as if to say that charge is nothing new. Instead, the conversation focuses on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business success or his pronouncements on preventing foreign Muslims from entering the United States, an attitude that jibes with the antipathy in much of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> toward the Muslim population in the western province of Xinjiang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Many in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> believe a pro-business Republican president will tend to be pragmatic and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-friendly, if not pro-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' said Wang Dong, associate professor of international studies at Peking University. ''Therefore, many in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tend to view </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> remarks of imposing more than 30 percent of tariffs on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as rhetorical campaign language.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> assertion that American troops in South Korea and Japan should be sent back to the United States is in alignment with official, though rarely stated, Chinese goals. But his suggestion, later reversed in part, that Japan and South Korea should be able to develop their own nuclear arsenals alarmed Beijing, especially the notion that Japan, the occupier of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in World War II, would become a nuclear power.</SPAN></P>
