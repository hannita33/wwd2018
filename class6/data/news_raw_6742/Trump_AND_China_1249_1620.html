<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Davos Gathering to Convene, With </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the Agenda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heads of state, business leaders and entrepreneurs will meet in the Swiss resort town of Davos on Tuesday for the world's most elite networking event, the annual World Economic Forum. Among the most anticipated guests this year will be President Xi Jinping of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> marking the first time that a Chinese head of state has attended the gathering. Participants will discuss topics like climate change, social inclusion and responsible leadership, against a backdrop of rising populism in Europe and the United States. President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is likely to be a major topic of discussion in the many sessions this week. Alexandra Stevenson</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bellwether Reports From Banks Are on the Way</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of banks' performance in the fourth quarter will continue to emerge this week, starting on Tuesday with a report from Morgan Stanley. During a period when industry trading results appear to have been strong, investors will see whether Morgan Stanley, which has gravitated toward more stable businesses like wealth management in recent years, has benefited. On Wednesday, investors will hear from Goldman Sachs, considered by many to be an industry bellwether. Goldman, which has historically made outsize profits from helping hedge funds and corporations trade and transact, recently introduced an online-lending apparatus, Marcus, to serve typical consumers. The report this quarter may offer a window into its promise. Kate Kelly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CANADIAN ECONOMY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank of Canada to Announce Benchmark Lending Rate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Bank of Canada announces its benchmark lending rate on Wednesday, few observers anticipate that it will follow the lead of its American counterpart and post an increase. Stephen S. Poloz, the Bank of Canada governor, said last month that compared with the United States, Canada's economy was further from reaching its full capacity, leading to the widespread assumption that the bank's overnight rate will stay at 0.5 percent. It will be the first rate announcement by Canada's central bank since the election of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Some of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election promises, notably a conditional vow to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, could help Canada's economy. But if he imposes a border tax on manufactured goods from Canada, the effect would be a significant drag on its export-dependent economy. Any such tax would be particularly problematic for the auto industry. Canada's car manufacturing and car parts businesses have been closely integrated with the United States since 1965, when the two countries agreed to free trade in the sector. Ian Austen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. ECONOMY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gas Prices Expected to Boost Consumer Price Index</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday morning, the Labor Department will release its latest reading on the Consumer Price Index. After a 0.2 percent increase in November's index, analysts are expecting a 0.3 percent rise for December, primarily because of rising gasoline prices. The core C.P.I., which strips out the more volatile food and energy prices, is expected to rise 0.2 percent, the same gain as the previous month. While the overall index inched up for a total 1.7 percent over the previous 12 months, the year-over-year rate for the core measure ticked down to 2.1 percent. Consumer confidence has continued to surge since the election. Patricia Cohen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EUROPEAN ECONOMY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E.C.B. Body to Debate Continuing Stimulus Measures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Central Bank's Governing Council will meet on Thursday and is likely to debate whether to begin weaning the eurozone from stimulus measures. No big moves in monetary policy are expected, but minutes from the last Governing Council meeting indicate that some members have begun arguing that the bank should begin easing off on its large purchases of government and corporate bonds. Those arguments gained traction in December, when inflation in the eurozone rose above 1 percent for the first time since 2013, bringing the rate closer to the official target of 2 percent.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil-Producing Countries to Discuss Price Controls</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers from OPEC countries are scheduled to join their counterparts from Russia and Oman in Vienna over the weekend to discuss whether oil producers are complying with the agreement reached last year to cut production to prop up prices, now $56 per barrel for Brent crude. The meeting of the ministerial monitoring committee is part of an effort to convince skeptical markets that the oil exporters are serious about cuts. Saudi Arabia, which is expected to attend the meeting along with fellow OPEC members Algeria, Kuwait and Venezuela, has already said it has cut production below 10 million barrels per day for the first time in nearly two years.
