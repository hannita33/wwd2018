<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The pot calls the kettle protectionist. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm not sure whether anyone but me cares about the Romney-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spat over trade policy; it's much more interesting, for normal human beings anyway, to talk about the size of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, er, hands. For that matter, even Romney's past relationship with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is notable mainly because racism and birtherism didn't bother him back in the good old days. Still, the trade dispute is a revealing fight, on both sides.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actually, a bit of background: establishment Republicans may talk free trade, but they are if anything more protectionist than Democrats in practice (although neither party is seriously protectionist these days.) Remember, it was Bush, not a Democrat, who imposed a WTO-illegal steel tariff, then had to back down in the face of European pressure. And going back, remember that Reagan, not Carter, imposed import quotas on Japanese cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason for this difference, I think, is twofold. First, Republicans are much less respectful of international obligations; it took a while for the Bushies to realize that trade rules apply to us, too, and that the EU is as big a trade superpower as we are. Second, there's a level of cynicism, of willingness to play politics with foreign affairs, on one side that isn't matched on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which brings me to the latest fight. Romney declares with horror that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would start a trade war. His economics is all wrong, which is the main thing; but it's also worth noting that thee and a half years ago Romney himself argued for exactly the same policies </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> advocates now, blithely dismissing the dangers: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency,&quot; Mr. Romney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the possibility of a trade war at his debate with President Obama, Mr. Romney said one was already under way. &quot;It's a silent one, and they're winning,&quot; he said. &quot;We can't just surrender and lose jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Romney could argue that the situation has changed - as it has since 2010, when I was arguing for the threat of countervailing duties. Back then </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was in fact engaged in harmful currency manipulation; these days it's bleeding reserves in the face of YUGE capital outflows (a trillion dollars last year!) that is, it's intervening to prop the yuan up, not hold it down. But that's not the case Romney is making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how do we score this debate? Four Pinnochios on each side. Romney talks nonsense economics, and condemns as terrible the very policies he himself called for not long ago. But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is stuck in a time warp, making arguments that had some force when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was booming but none in the current situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sorry, but no winners here, just big losers. Sad.</SPAN></P>
