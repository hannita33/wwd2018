</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Confirmation hearings to begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate will hold meetings this week to consider President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cabinet nominees. Democrats are seeking to delay the proceedings because the nominees have not all completed background checks and ethics clearances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hearing for Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> choice for attorney general, is scheduled for Tuesday. If Mr. Sessions is confirmed, he is expected to reverse many Obama administration policies on immigration and criminal justice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. intelligence findings mocked in Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian politicians and commentators ridiculed an American report outlining an elaborate plot ordered by the Kremlin to alter the outcome of the 2016 presidential race, citing a lack of evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in Louisiana and Indiana shared similar views. &quot;What's the big deal?&quot; one asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turkey and Russia deepen relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent Russian airstrikes to support a Turkish offensive against the Islamic State in Syria signal a remarkable change from November 2015, when a Turkish fighter jet shot down a Russian military plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relationship between the two nations threatens to marginalize the U.S. in efforts to shape Syria's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Florida suspect's troubled past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Esteban Santiago, an Iraq war veteran, is scheduled to appear in court today to face charges related to the fatal shooting of five people at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. His relatives say he often spoke about being tormented by voices in his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the shooting, a rumor that there was a second gunman led to more chaos. &quot;Nobody gave us information, and as time went on, we were treated more and more like suspects,&quot; one traveler said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Golden Globe Awards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;La La Land&quot; won a record seven awards, including for best picture comedy or musical. &quot;Moonlight&quot; was named best picture drama. Here's a complete list of the winners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ceremony took a political turn when Meryl Streep used her acceptance speech to denounce the president-elect. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> responded to the criticism hours later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Changes in how the U.S. taxes corporations are likely to come during this session of Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consequences for the economy are huge, our writer says, and they would be felt &quot;in global financial markets and the aisles of your local Walmart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uber is trying to persuade cities to consider it as part of the future of urban development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ride-hailing service has created a website that will allow city planners to study traffic patterns that Uber vehicles have collected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Would taking part in a simulated plane crash with co-workers improve morale at the office</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We look at a company called Survival Systems USA, which designs extreme team-building exercises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. stocks were up on Friday. Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smarter Living: Morning Edition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(In this new section, we'll help you start your day right.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you're hitting the gym this morning, don't forget to warm up. It may save your knees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A New Year's challenge for the mind: Make this the year you quiet all those negative thoughts swirling around your brain. Here's how.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recipe of the day: Don't order food tonight, make your own takeout-style sesame noodles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Palestinian driver in Jerusalem rammed a truck into Israeli soldiers getting off a bus, killing at least four and injuring 17, the police said. The violence ended months of relative calm in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In memoriam: Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former Iranian president who favored closer ties with the West, died at 82.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nat Hentoff, 91, was a jazz critic, civil libertarian, author and journalist who wrote for the Village Voice for 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sports roundup: Houston, Pittsburgh, Green Bay and Seattle advanced in the N.F.L. playoffs. In college football, Clemson takes on Alabama for the national title (8 p.m. Eastern, ESPN).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Hidden Figures&quot; and &quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&quot; tied for first at the North American box office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I hope I've made you proud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was Michelle Obama on Friday, in her final public speech as first lady.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, President Obama will deliver his farewell address in Chicago, his hometown and the city where he celebrated his presidential victory in 2008.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 360 video: Sleeping in the cold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When video surfaced last year showing the Denver police seizing blankets from homeless people, it created a public outcry. Watch some homeless people describing the city's laws banning urban camping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ties that bind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attachment theory states that the quality of our early attachments profoundly influences how we behave as adults. The idea is influencing programs in inner-city preschools as well as executive coaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say the theory resonates in an era when people seem more attached to smartphones than to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If one of your resolutions this year is to eat healthier in the morning, consider porridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The combination of grain and water is arguably comfort served in its most humble form. The dish has also been feeding the world for thousands of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congee, a rice-based porridge, has been eaten in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> since about 2500 B.C. Koreans make several variations called juk, including one with pine nuts as the main ingredient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upma is a thick porridge common in south India made from roasted semolina or rice flour. And in Ethiopia, genfo, unique for its use of red pepper, is a traditional Sunday breakfast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On many cold mornings, Americans start their days with oatmeal. The actor Wilford Brimley famously pitched the food's health benefits in an ad, saying, &quot;It's the right thing to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And oats have been a staple of what is now Scotland since the Roman Empire. A village in the Scottish Highlands even hosts a global porridge-making competition, where the Golden Spurtle is the top prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former oldest living woman in Scotland swore by the dish. Before her death in 2015 at age 109, Jessie Gallan revealed her secret to longevity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A nice warm bowl of porridge every morning,&quot; she said, and &quot;staying away from men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
