<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan sharply criticized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> leaders on Saturday, saying they had resorted to military and economic threats in order to intimidate the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''Step by step, Beijing is going back to the old path of dividing, coercing and even threatening and intimidating Taiwan,'' she told journalists in Taipei, the capital, at a year-end news conference. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tensions between Taiwan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, which have been rivals since the Communist Revolution of 1949, intensified in December after Ms. Tsai spoke on the phone with the American president-elect, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, breaking a longstanding diplomatic practice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent weeks, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has stepped up military activities near Taiwan, sending its sole aircraft carrier through the waters near the island and dispatching military planes in the region. On Monday, Beijing announced that S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe, an island nation off the west coast of Africa that was one of Taiwan's fewer than two dozen remaining diplomatic allies, had switched its allegiance to the mainland, provoking an outcry in Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite Beijing's recent actions, which she said had ''hurt the feelings'' of the Taiwanese people and destabilized relations, Ms. Tsai vowed to avoid a confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We will not bow to pressure, and we will of course not revert to the old path of confrontation,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Tsai faces the delicate task of registering discontent with Beijing while also sending a message that Taiwan will exercise restraint. The United States, which sees Taiwan as one of its most reliable allies in Asia and has sold billions of dollars of weapons to the island, has long sought to avoid a conflict between the two sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the election of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could complicate matters. He has antagonized Beijing with a series of critical comments. The president-elect has also questioned the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy, which has underpinned relations between Washington and Beijing for decades, and criticized </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> military buildup in the disputed South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bonnie S. Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Ms. Tsai's words might reassure American officials that she would not pursue rash policies in the face of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> show of strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''She remains calm, rational and patient,'' Ms. Glaser wrote in an email.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Ms. Tsai, whose Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally favored independence for Taiwan, could face serious challenges in the coming months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many people in Taiwan are nervous that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will use the island as a bargaining chip against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. And Ms. Tsai's preference for stability in the region may not mesh with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> bombastic style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Richard C. Bush, the director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said Ms. Tsai understood the need to ''maintain a balance among relations with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, relations with the United States and domestic politics.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Tsai's vision, however, ''may not align well with the incoming </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration's apparent belief that it can pressure </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on all fronts more than the Obama administration has,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Tsai also sought to quell concerns about planned stopovers in Houston and San Francisco during a visit to Central America scheduled for January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday called on the United States to block Ms. Tsai from entering the country, warning that such a visit would embolden independence activists in Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Tsai described the visit as ''unofficial,'' saying, ''A transit stop is just a transit stop.''</SPAN></P>
