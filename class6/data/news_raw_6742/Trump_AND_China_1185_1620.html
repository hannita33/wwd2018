</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is still fighting a war in Afghanistan and has troops in Iraq, the Iranian nuclear deal remains controversial, the Islamic State is weakened but continues to be threatening, North Korea is launching missiles, Russia flouts international norms, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has expansionary designs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a dangerous world. Yet in the American presidential election the foreign policy debate seems to chiefly involve insults and clich&eacute;s. Since none of these issues will disappear by Inauguration Day, the news media and public would do well to press Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Hillary Clinton to better define their views over the next six weeks. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Based on suggestions from six top national security experts, Republicans and Democrats, here are some questions that should be asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Let's start with Mrs. Clinton. She is more of a foreign policy hawk than President Obama. She voted for the Iraq war in 2003, spearheaded the 2011 Libyan intervention and unsuccessfully tried to get the United States more involved in the Syrian civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Question: Libya is now a dysfunctional terrorist haven; Mr. Obama says the ''worst mistake'' of his presidency was failing to prepare for what happened after toppling Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. Do you disagree with the president, were you mistaken, and what have you learned?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Question: How likely is it that all the parties in the Syrian crisis -- the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey -- could cut a delicate deal: Bashar al-Assad remains in power for a while, then a transition government prepares for elections? If not, what other path is there for resolution?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton said the Trans-Pacific Partnership was the ''gold standard'' for trade deals and would bolster American security and economic interests in Asia. As a presidential candidate, facing the anti-free-trade Bernie Sanders, she flipped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Question: Most of America's important allies in Asia say the Pacific pact is crucial to counter Chinese political and economic hegemony in the region. Are they wrong?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the alliance between the United States and 27 other countries, including the three Baltic States: Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Article 5 of its charter explicitly states that an attack on one member should be considered an attack on all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Question: You have praised President Vladimir V. Putin, vowing to fashion better relations with Russia. But if, as he did in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin intervened militarily in one of the Baltic States, would you favor invoking NATO's Article 5 and sending forces to counter Russia?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Question: Can you explain your concept of nuclear deterrence and how your willingness to have Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia acquire nuclear weapons enhances global security?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the 1968 election, Richard M. Nixon claimed to have a ''secret plan'' to end the Vietnam War. He won the election, and the war lasted six more years, with more than 21,000 Americans killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Question: Secret plans usually are secret because they aren't real. You have claimed to have a ''foolproof'' secret plan to defeat the Islamic State. Unless you specifically lay out a plan, that promise comes across as empty as Mr. Nixon's secret Vietnam plan. What is your plan and how quickly would you eliminate the Islamic State?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Question to both: Since Jimmy Carter's Camp David summit meeting, five different presidents have failed to make much progress on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. What would you do differently, or should the United States stay out?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Question to both: Top national security advisers are central to a president's conduct of policy: Mr. Nixon had Henry Kissinger, Jimmy Carter had Zbigniew Brzezinski, and the first George Bush had Brent Scowcroft. Could you name a few of your most important foreign policy advisers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The stilted format makes it unlikely that a whole lot of information will be forthcoming at Monday night's much-hyped debate. But it would certainly help voters if these questions were raised before Election Day.</SPAN></P>
