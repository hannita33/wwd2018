</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serious disagreements emerged between President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and some of his nominees in the third day of confirmation hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> choice for defense secretary, Gen. James N. Mattis,said Russia was trying to break NATO. Here's where General Mattisstands on other issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rex W. Tillerson, the choice for secretary of state, faces a second round of questions - Wednesday, he called for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be denied access to its artificial islands in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Follow our coverage of the hearings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The intrigue over a sensational but entirely unverified dossier on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ties to Russia deepened. The ex-spy who compiled the information disappeared from his home in Britain, saying he feared for his safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> discussed the dossier with James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence. They had radically different takeaways from the conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Justice Department said it would investigate the decision by James B. Comey, above, the F.B.I. chief, to inform Congress about a new review in the Hillary Clinton email investigation ahead of the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prosecutors in South Korea are planning to use revelations about a cultural blacklist to strengthen the impeachment charges against President Park Geun-hye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, two versions of the blacklist have been reported by the news media, citing anonymous sources. One version listed more than 9,000 people, including some of the country's most beloved filmmakers, actors and writers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Above, Hong Sung-dam, one of the artists who was reportedly blacklisted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, ended a two-day visit with President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines in which he promised the country about $8.7 billion worth of business deals, investments and equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Abe is on four-nation diplomatic push that will continue with stops in Australia, Indonesia and Vietnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, Mr. Duterte ordered government agencies to provide free contraception to women, especially the poor, in a move that is likely to face strong resistance from Catholic leadership in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Above, protesters in the Philippines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And we look at Aceh Province, Indonesia, which began enforcing Shariah law in 2001. Women are required to wear head scarves, alcohol is prohibited and many offenses are punishable by public whipping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Muslim-majority nation has drifted in a conservative direction, but one Aceh politician says that &quot;a silent majority&quot; thinks the local government has gone too far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the country's capital, Jakarta, three candidates vying to be governor of the city will meet for a televised debate tonight. The incumbent, a Christian, is on trial over charges that he insulted the Quran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> India's largest conglomerate, the Tata Group, named Natarajan Chandrasekaran, 53, to be chairman of its holding company, Tata Sons, ending months of turmoil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health care stocks tumbled after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> denounced pharmaceutical companies for shifting manufacturing abroad. But many of the imports are generic drugs - a large percentage of which are manufactured in India - that help keep costs down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Environmental Protection Agency accused Fiat Chrysler of cheating on emissions tests on at least 104,000 diesel vehicles, a case with echoes of the Volkswagen scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vietnam's industrial policy will take a hit if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> follows through on his pledge to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but companies have their own plans for going global.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. stocks were down. Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're superstitious, today isn't your day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Friday the 13th isn't universally feared. Many countries disregard it. In Greece and some Spanish-speaking countries, Tuesday the 13th is the dreaded day. It's Friday the 17th in Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number four is unlucky in parts of Asia - its pronunciation in several languages is close to the word &quot;death,&quot; making April 4 (4/4) a day to stay inside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A maneki-neko, a cute charm showing a cat with a raised paw, is used to ward off the bad luck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other animals believed to combat bad omens include pigs. In Germany, marzipan pigs are given as gifts on New Year's Eve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if a cricket is chirping in your house, don't kill it. Across Asia, Africa and Europe, the insects are viewed as harbingers of wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magpies have great significance in Britain. Seeing a single magpie can be bad luck, it is believed, though saluting one can ward off ill fortune. But if you spot a group, you may be in luck, according to an old nursery rhyme that goes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One for sorrow,<BR> Two for joy,<BR> Three for a girl,<BR> Four for a boy,<BR> Five for silver,<BR> Six for gold,<BR> Seven for a secret never to be told.</SPAN></P>
