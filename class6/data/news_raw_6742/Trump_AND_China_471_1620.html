<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is very likely going to be the Republican nominee for president of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take three deep breaths. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I know we've been on this path for a long time, but it's still hard getting your head around the idea, isn't it? Just to ease the transition, our first-ever exclusively Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> quiz:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1) After his big string of victories this week, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appeared on MSNBC's ''Morning Joe,'' where he was asked who his foreign policy advisers were. He said:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) ''I'm speaking with a lot of generals. Very impressive people. All winners.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) ''I'm speaking with myself.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) ''I have a long list. It's a good list. Vladimir Putin said it was the best list he'd ever seen.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2) After making his surprise endorsement, Ben Carson said that there were ''two different Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trumps</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' and that the private one was ''very cerebral.'' Asked about that comment, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> replied:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) ''I think there are two Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trumps</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) ''I don't think there are two Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trumps</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) ''I think there are two Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trumps</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ... I don't think there are two Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trumps</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> claimed on ''Good Morning America'' that there was ''nobody that's done so much for equality as I have.'' As an example he pointed to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) His endorsements by Mike Tyson and Dennis Rodman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) The black guy who won ''The Apprentice'' in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) His $100,000-membership club, Mar-a-Lago -- ''totally open to everybody.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  4) After a protester rushed the stage at one of his rallies, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> claimed the man was associated with ISIS, and retweeted a video of him holding a gun in front of the ISIS flag. When NBC's Chuck Todd pointed out that it was a hoax, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) ''Whoops.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) ''All I know is what's on the Internet.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) ''As Kierkegaard said, 'The truth is a trap.'''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  5) One of the groups that's been opening </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rallies is USA Freedom Kids, little girls who sang about ''President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">'' who ''knows how to make America great ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) ''... And give us schools that really rate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) ''... Teach us to love and not to hate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) ''... Deal from strength or get crushed every time.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  6) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> defended the supporter who sucker-punched a protester being led away by security forces. He said the attack was justified because the protester:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) Had violently attacked an elderly woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) Had tried to grab one of the officer's guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) Was ''sticking a certain finger up in the air.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  7) House Speaker Paul Ryan scored a great triumph at the end of 2015 when the House passed a compromise spending bill that keeps the government running through the fall. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has been loudly critical, and at a recent rally in North Carolina, he said the bill was bad because:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) ''The appropriation for infrastructure repair is inadequate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) ''It fails to address the really critical Puerto Rican oil export issue.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) ''It funds ISIS.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  8) Sarah Palin had to leave the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign to be with her husband, who had a serious snowmobile accident. Before her departure she said Todd's multiple injuries made her appreciate:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) ''The skill of Alaskan emergency treatment centers.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) ''The time that we have to spend in doing something so worthy, and that's to get Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> elected president.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) ''The stress my family has undergone due to my unflagging pursuit of celebrity.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  9) After </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> defended the use of torture against suspected terrorists, his son Eric, who was campaigning for him, pointed out that waterboarding:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) ''Is no different than what happens on college campuses in frat houses every day.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) ''Has real efficacy when employed as a last resort in isolated incidences.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) ''Is no worse than what </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> doing to our manufacturing base.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  10) Since he threw his support behind </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Gov. Chris Christie has been humiliated on a daily basis for everything -- from his slavish stare at the candidate's press conferences to widespread criticism of his absence from New Jersey while he toils on the campaign trail. To pay him back, at a pre-primary event this week, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) Made fun of Christie for the absentee thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) Announced he was indeed planning to make Christie secretary of transportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) Invited Christie to tell the audience about all the things he went through on 9/11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  11) </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has endlessly complained about the way immigrants steal jobs from American workers, but he's used loopholes in federal law to hire foreign workers himself. At a recent debate he argued that voters wouldn't care about that seeming contradiction because:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A) ''Everybody would like a Romanian helper.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  B) ''Nobody knows the system better than me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  C) ''What happens in Mar-a-Lago stays in Mar-a-Lago.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ANSWERS: 1-B, 2-C, 3-C, 4-B, 5-C, 6-C, 7-C, 8-B, 9-A, 10-A, 11-B</SPAN></P>
