<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- The Obama administration plans to use annual talks with leaders in Beijing to push for cuts in excess Chinese industrial output, which has inundated foreign markets with discounted steel, aluminum and other products, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said in Beijing on Sunday ahead of the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The talks, known as the U.S.-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strategic and Economic Dialogue, bring together senior American and Chinese officials every year to discuss a broad range of economic, foreign policy and security concerns. On the economic side of the talks, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> exchange rate controls and intellectual property violations will be high on the American agenda, while North Korea and the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea are expected to dominate the security talks. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Lew said the economic track of the meeting in the Chinese capital this year would also take up </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> flood of exports of steel and other products, which have spilled into the international marketplace, provoking anger from producers, unions and politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Excess capacity is not just a domestic issue,'' Mr. Lew told an audience of students and academics at Tsinghua University ahead of the start of the dialogue on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The question of excess capacity is one that really has an enormous effect on global markets for things like steel and aluminum,'' he said. ''We're seeing distortions in global markets because of excess capacity.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A senior Chinese official said last week that his side was prepared to discuss excess capacity but was vague about how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We do not shy away from problems,'' the official, Zhu Guangyao, a vice minister of finance, told reporters at a briefing. ''Anything can be discussed in the economic dialogue.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, have said they will cut back production at steel mills, coal mines and other plants, where capacity far exceeds domestic demand, especially as the economy slows and shifts away from smokestack industries. Mr. Xi has made that part of a program of shifting investment to more rewarding areas that he calls ''supply-side structural reform.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We cannot wait just because the burden is heavy, or fail to act just because there are many hardships,'' Mr. Xi said at a meeting of policy makers in May in which the program for cutting excess capacity was discussed, according to an official summary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the Chinese government's plans remain opaque, and, meanwhile, much of that excess output is being sold on foreign markets where other manufacturers are struggling to compete with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> much cheaper production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The cut-price exports of solar panels, aluminum and other goods have become especially contentious during the American presidential race. Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Bernie Sanders have both argued strongly that trade agreements have been unfairly tilted against American workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In March, the United States put a tariff of 266 percent on some Chinese steel makers for selling below cost. And last month, in separate actions, the Commerce Department announced duties of 450 percent and 522 percent on some imports of Chinese steel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Lew appeared to wager that he could help win more action from Beijing by putting excess capacity high on the agenda before the Group of 20 summit meeting of leaders of the major economies, which </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will hold in the eastern city of Hangzhou in September. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is also trying to win official status as a market economy from the United States and European Union, which would make it easier for its manufacturers to ward off punitive tariffs on exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Referring to the excess capacity, Mr. Lew said on Sunday, ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> capacity to address that is central to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economy, to the global economy and to the U.S.-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> relationship.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He went on, ''I believe that it is deeply in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> interest to follow through on the policies that have been outlined'' in previous Chinese leadership meetings. ''Excess capacity ultimately is corrosive of an economy's economic efficiency. It means that you have a misallocation of resources.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Lew said the Obama administration was watching to see whether changes introduced by the Chinese authorities in August amounted to a real, lasting step toward loosening controls on the renminbi exchange rate. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> devalued the currency by almost 2 percent, and the central bank, the People's Bank of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, said at the time that market forces would play a bigger role in setting the value of the currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent months, he noted, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has sometimes acted to strengthen the value of the renminbi, making imports into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> more attractive, rather than weakening the currency. More recently, the yuan has weakened against the dollar to levels not seen in five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The strategic dialogue began nearly 10 years ago in George W. Bush's administration as an effort for the United States and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to set an agenda for the most important issues and find a path to solving them. In 2009, it grew from an economic focus to include security issues. The meeting has evolved into a set of talks involving hundreds of officials meeting over several days to discuss issues as diverse as civilian aviation and the protection of elephants, as well as the big economic and security matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But with Mr. Xi concentrating more power in his own hands, the usefulness of such a wide-ranging exercise may have outrun itself, some Americans said. Mr. Xi opened the dialogue with a speech, but his close aides will not participate directly in the talks. Mr. Xi's closest economic adviser, Liu He, is not in the formal talks, though Mr. Lew met with him on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With the Obama administration in its final lap and a leadership transition looming in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> next year, it is unlikely that this year's dialogue will result in any breakthroughs, said Eswar S. Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''While the dialogue will include many top-level Chinese technocrats, there is a widespread perception that their influence on economic policies and reforms has been circumscribed by the rising concentration of power in the hands of President Xi and a close circle of his aides,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The new American president -- whether Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or Hillary Clinton -- would be unlikely to continue the annual talks in such a broad manner, Professor Prasad said. Top officials on both sides probably view the dialogue this year ''as their last waltz together,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
