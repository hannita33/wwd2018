<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- Terry Branstad, the Iowa governor who has long embraced </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a market for his state's pork and soybeans, was tapped Wednesday by President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to represent the United States in one of its most complex and increasingly contentious foreign relationships, as his ambassador to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In choosing Mr. Branstad, 70, an amiable politician who likes to describe President Xi Jinping of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as an ''old friend,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sounded a softer note alongside his unrelenting criticism of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> economic relationship with the United States. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At an event on Wednesday morning at Cipriani restaurant in Manhattan to raise money for his inauguration, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told the audience that Mr. Branstad was a great choice. ''He knows them all,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said three separate times, according to an attendee. The selection was first reported by Bloomberg News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was quick to embrace the choice, even before Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> announcement. At a regular news briefing in Beijing on Wednesday, Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, described Mr. Branstad as ''an old friend of the Chinese people,'' a phrase used to describe politicians trusted by Beijing. ''We would welcome him playing a bigger role in promoting Sino-American relations,'' Mr. Lu said of Mr. Branstad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As ambassador, Mr. Branstad would find himself in the middle of an increasingly fraught relationship. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaigned against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, repeatedly describing Chinese imports to the United States as a form of theft. He has proposed a steep tariff on those imports and promised to seek vigorous enforcement of trade rules, such as restrictions on state support for private companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The selection also comes just days after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke with Taiwan's president by phone, prompting criticism from Beijing, which regards Taiwan as a breakaway province. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> then defended the call in a pair of Twitter messages criticizing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for its trade practices and provocative moves in the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Branstad is unusual in that he would have personal relationships with the leaders of both countries. Like many of the president-elect's choices for senior positions in his administration, the governor was an early and unwavering supporter of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> candidacy. One of the governor's sons, Eric, ran the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign in Iowa. Another son, Marcus, has gone hunting with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> eldest son, Donald Jr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Robert Hormats, a former under secretary of state in the Obama administration and now a vice chairman of Kissinger Associates, praised the choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's a good pick because he knows President Xi, he can represent the heartland of the United States, which I think is very positive, and the fact that President Xi has been in his state twice is a very positive thing,'' Mr. Hormats said Wednesday in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. ''It creates a personal relationship that is very hard to replicate.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Branstad, an Iowa native, graduated from the University of Iowa and then served briefly in the Army -- yielding a priceless story about his role in arresting Jane Fonda for trespassing at Fort Bragg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A lawyer by training, he entered the Iowa Legislature in 1973 and won election as governor in 1983. He served until 1999, then returned to office in 2011. In between, he was president of Des Moines University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Branstad first met Mr. Xi in 1985, when as the first-term governor of Iowa he hosted a Chinese delegation that came to study American agricultural practices. The delegation included a 31-year-old official from rural Hebei Province, Mr. Xi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Xi has fondly recalled that visit. He stayed in Muscatine, a small city in the eastern part of the state, where he was hosted by a couple and slept in their boys' vacated bedroom, filled with ''Star Trek'' action figures. In early 2012, Mr. Xi briefly revisited Muscatine as vice president while preparing for his promotion to Communist Party leader later that year. He became the president in 2013.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You can't even imagine what a deep impression I had from my visit 27 years ago to Muscatine, because you were the first group of Americans that I came into contact with,'' he told a group that included Mr. Branstad during his visit there. ''My impression of the country came from you. For me, you are America.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During his second stay in the governor's mansion, Mr. Branstad has aggressively courted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a market for Iowa's produce. He has said little in public about the tensions over territorial disputes, North Korea's nuclear weapons, and human rights restrictions in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that have shaped relations at the national level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has visited </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> several times, most recently on a trade mission in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Iowa, like the rest of the United States, runs a trade deficit with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The Chinese buy food from the United States, including Iowa's corn and pork. But Americans buy far more from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- a range of goods that can be surveyed at Walmart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States imported $483 billion in goods and services from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last year, while exporting $116 billion to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The numbers are similar this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As governor, Mr. Branstad has sought to increase American exports without criticizing Chinese imports, the standard Republican Party line before Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ascendence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I am excited to catch up with our old friend, Xi Jinping,'' Mr. Branstad said during a trade mission to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in 2013, which included a meeting with the new Chinese president. ''The value of this relationship cannot be overstated. As a result, Iowa is the preferred provider to feed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> growing population and our agriculture exports to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continue to grow.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has taken a very different line on that relationship. He has said repeatedly that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is suppressing the value of its currency, an outdated accusation. In recent years, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has intervened in exchange markets to prop up the value of its currency, manipulation that tends to benefit American exporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Mr. Branstad is confirmed by the Senate, Iowa would get its first female governor. Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds, 57, would take Mr. Branstad's place.</SPAN></P>
