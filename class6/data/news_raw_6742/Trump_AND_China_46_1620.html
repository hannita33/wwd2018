<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke on the phone with Taiwan's president on Friday, he was wading into one of Asia's longest-running and sensitive issues: the dispute between Taiwan and mainland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the call alarmed experts, who say it risks upending decades of American efforts to manage the dispute, nonexperts could be forgiven for scratching their heads about the uproar. What follows, then, is a guide to the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Taiwan issue: why it is so delicate, what role the United States has in the matter and why the phone call is significant. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What is the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Taiwan issue?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both players claimed, at least formally, to represent all of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- which they considered to include each other's territory. That created problems, including periodic risks of war, for decades.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The disagreement dates to 1927, when civil war broke out in the Republic of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The war culminated in Communist revolutionaries, led by Mao Zedong, mostly defeating </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nationalist government in 1949.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But the Nationalist leaders fled to Taiwan, which their forces still controlled. Though fighting eventually stopped, both sides continued to claim all of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The Taiwan-based government considered mainland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to be controlled by illegitimate Communist rebels. The Beijing-based government considered Taiwan a breakaway province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In this sense, the civil war was never fully resolved. Thus, Taiwan's formal name is still the Republic of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Mainland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- controlled by the Communist government in Beijing -- is called the People's Republic of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Their dispute became a global Cold War issue. The Soviet Union and its allies recognized Beijing as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rightful government, while the United States and its allies recognized the Nationalists in Taiwan. The Taiwan government even held the United Nations seat for all of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the 1970s, the world began accepting the reality of a divided </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Beijing took over the United Nations seat in 1971. President Richard M. Nixon traveled to mainland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the next year. In 1979, America switched its recognition from the Taiwan government to Beijing's. Many other countries followed suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since then, no American president or president-elect is believed to have spoken with a Taiwanese president -- until the phone call on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why don't </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Taiwan just split?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This would be extremely difficult for either government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Beijing government has never given up hope of reintegrating Taiwan. Territorial integrity is an existential issue for all countries, but it is especially sensitive for Beijing, which fears emboldening separatism in Tibet and other regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Taiwan government is constrained on both sides. It cannot offer to reintegrate with the mainland, as the island is a democracy and Taiwanese people would be unwilling to surrender their freedoms. At the same time, Beijing has credibly threatened war should Taiwan declare independence. Taiwan cannot formally drop its claim to mainland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, because it would be seen as tantamount to declaring independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This led, in 1992, to a semiofficial arrangement: Both countries agreed that there is only one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, encompassing the mainland and Taiwan. But they also agreed to disagree about what that means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Beijing is adamant about upholding this policy because it carries the promise of reunification. But in Taiwan, it has been controversial. Some prefer warm ties with their fellow Chinese and have sought to bolster trade. Others, particularly younger voters, distrust Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over time, Taiwan's citizens have become more likely to call themselves Taiwanese -- a distinct national identity -- than Chinese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some Taiwanese leaders have questioned the current arrangement, including President Tsai Ing-wen, who was elected this year. She has promised to uphold the status quo but stopped short of endorsing the 1992 understanding -- exacerbating Beijing's fears that Taiwan could declare independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, by speaking with Ms. Tsai on the phone and referring to her as ''the President of Taiwan'' in a Twitter post, indulged those fears -- and upended the traditional American stance, known as the ''One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What is the ''One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' policy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Because both Taiwan and Beijing claim the same territory, foreign states cannot recognize both. Beijing forces countries to choose, as the policy's name indicates, ''one </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.'' Nearly all countries have chosen Beijing, which controls the world's second-largest economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States has a particular kind of One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy, meant to accomplish three main goals: keep positive relations with Beijing, with which the United States has a host of agreements and interests; protect and assist Taiwan, a fellow democracy; and prevent the outbreak of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though the United States officially broke off relations with Taiwan in 1979, it maintains a nonprofit center known as the American Institute in Taiwan, which acts as a barely unofficial embassy. The United States has also worked to promote Taiwan's democracy and has sold it advanced military equipment, though these sales have declined in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In this way, the United States is able to deny Taiwan recognition, yet also ensure it is strong enough to remain functionally independent. The policy should not be mistaken as a favor or handout to Beijing. Rather, it is intended to maintain American interests in both mainland </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Taiwan and prevent instability or war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the United States has come to play a crucial balancing role, both sides have scrutinized any hint of change in the American position. In 1995, Washington broke with practice by granting a visa to Taiwan's president. Beijing considered this a possible step toward recognition of Taiwanese independence and, in response, fired missiles into the Taiwan Strait. The United States, in turn, placed two aircraft carrier groups nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though the crisis ended peacefully, it underscored the United States' role in maintaining stability and the risk or war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why does the phone call matter?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The call does not in itself change policy, but it implies the possibility of a shift, forcing both </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Taiwan to guess at Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team, by categorizing his call with Ms. Tsai of Taiwan alongside calls with other heads of state, implied that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> recognized her as the leader of a sovereign state. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also wrote on Twitter that he had spoken to the ''President of Taiwan.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Recognizing Ms. Tsai as a sovereign leader would communicate that the United States considered Taiwan an independent nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Such a position would force both Taiwan and Beijing into a difficult choice. Either ignore American policy on the issue -- perhaps ending the decades-long American role in balancing cross-strait relations -- or confront Taiwanese independence, which Beijing has said would provoke war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Both Beijing and Taiwan have played down the phone call, suggesting that they would prefer to see Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> words as a mistake rather than a deliberate policy shift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has retained some advisers who advocate more fully siding with the democratic Taiwan over the authoritarian </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, perhaps even granting the former partial or full recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Taiwan, preparing for potential changes in America's policy, must ask whether the call hints at a coming change, or at least at the possibility that hard-liners on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> team could steer policy in radically new directions. If they are unsure, prudence would seem to require at least preparing for the possibility of a shift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why can America sell arms to Taiwan but not call its leader?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many Americans might reasonably wonder about this question, which Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> raised in a Twitter post in defense of the phone call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  United States arms sales to Taiwan have indeed been controversial, particularly with Beijing. But they are an approach intended to maintain the status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By selling Taiwan arms, the United States ensures that the island can deter an invasion from the mainland's far larger military. This maintains a balance of power that, while fragile, is intended to prevent war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Granting Taiwan's leader informal recognition, or even an unofficial upgrade in ties, is different because it disturbs the status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Why has this alarmed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> experts?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To be fair to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, past presidents have adjusted the level of support for Taiwan, for example by increasing or reducing arms sales. But those policy shifts typically came with an explanation, so that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Taiwan understood American intentions and knew what was and was not changing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What is different is that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not made clear whether or not he intends to end America's 37-year-old policy on Taiwan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The fact of the phone call implies that he does intend to do so, but the possibility that he erred implies that maybe he does not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In this way, the issue is not that he caused offense or broke with tradition, but rather that he introduced real uncertainty about how the United States will approach this issue under his leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In international relations, especially on tense issues, a lack of clarity or predictability can be destabilizing because it forces all states to plan for the worst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The American policy on Taiwan and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is already ambiguous by design. In 2004, when asked about the One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy, a senior State Department official told a congressional hearing, ''I didn't really define it, and I'm not sure I very easily could define it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While the policy may be tough to articulate, it has at least been predictable. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, intentionally or not, has added a layer of ambiguity that is wholly new.</SPAN></P>
