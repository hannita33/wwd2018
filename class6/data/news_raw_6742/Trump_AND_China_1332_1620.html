<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- As tempting as it is for a new administration to cram as much as possible into its first 100 days, the period is almost always dominated by events the president did not anticipate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is sobering, humbling and almost always marred by crisis. Sometimes it takes a tragic turn. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All new administrations set grand plans: ambitious legislation introduced on Capitol Hill, trips across the country to promote the new policies, visits with foreign dignitaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then reality intervenes. Barack Obama had to deal with a Somali pirate attack while he was trying to resuscitate the collapsing economy. George W. Bush, fresh from the bruising recount battle, quickly had to resolve tense military disputes abroad. Bill Clinton's early days in office were consumed with controversies over military service by openly gay men and lesbians and by the deadly government-led raid in Waco, Tex.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The New York Times interviewed senior officials from the Clinton, Bush and Obama White Houses who were there for the first 100 days of their administrations. These are their recollections of their setbacks and triumphs as they discovered that they were better off leaving their briefing books at home. Interviews have been condensed and edited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bill Clinton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Day 1 approval rating: 58 percent; Day 100: 55 percent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Clinton was managing crises of various degrees from the first days of his presidency. There was the divisive ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy and a public outcry over his first attorney general pick, who had hired an undocumented immigrant as a nanny. Then the deadly siege in Waco caught the nation and its new president completely off guard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jan. 14, 1993: The Times reported that Zo&euml; Baird had employed an undocumented immigrant as her nanny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mack McLarty, chief of staff</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As President Clinton said, I think my honeymoon was about 30 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There's so much to do and so little time. You're invariably going to have U.F.O.s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dee Dee Myers, press secretary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Zo&euml; Baird thing hit, and that sent us into crisis mode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I remember we were in George Stephanopoulos's office, and President Clinton came in. And we were trying to figure out how to manage this. By today's standards, of course, it seems like nothing. She had hired people who were in the country illegally as her housekeeper, and the woman's husband was her driver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We wondered: Were we O.K.? Can we put this back together, if she apologizes and pays back taxes on them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mark D. Gearan, deputy chief of staff</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It felt like some of the political pressure and the voices on this were steadier and stronger from outside Washington because, of course, in an urban area it was much more normative. It felt somewhat disconnected from Washington. And there was some need on our part to kind of catch up with the reaction that people had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Myers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He wanted an administration that looked like America, and he pledged that his cabinet would reflect that. And the expectation was that one of the big four would be a woman. The secretaries of state, defense, Treasury were all men. The pressure to appoint a woman was substantial. And that complicated the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gearan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If anything, you go back to 1993 in the context of technology today, social media, broadly the media and how we got information, it seems like I worked for Millard Fillmore or something. It's extraordinary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Late January 1993: Mr. Clinton had promised during his campaign to look for a way to lift the ban on military service by openly gay men and lesbians. But resistance from leaders of both parties quickly made that impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Myers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So that blew up. And what made that so challenging was it wasn't a partisan issue. Sam Nunn [Democrat of Georgia] was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and he basically laid his body down and said, ''This ain't gonna happen.'' And we were stuck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Colin Powell was against it. We were checkmated early in that game, so the question was: How do you advance the goal of gay and lesbian Americans serving openly in the armed services, or serving at all, with the reality that the public didn't support it, the Congress didn't support it and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff didn't support it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gearan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As part of the distraction, there was the confusion about the policy within the party and on the Hill -- the question of ''Why are we bringing this up? Why did we start with this issue?'' There was a sense that this had intentionally been placed on the first-100-day agenda when in fact there were these things that came to him. It's not like any working memo of the first 100 days recommended ''Nannygate,'' Waco and ''Don't ask'' as the legislative agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McLarty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I used to keep a Waterford dome on my desk that Steny Hoyer [a Democratic congressman from Maryland] gave me, because each one of those members thinks they're going to be the most important person that you're going to see that day. And some of them, particularly in the Senate, think they should be sitting there in the Oval Office instead of the current occupant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  April 19, 1993: The F.B.I. raided the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, leading to the deaths of 76 people, including children. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Myers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That was horrible for so many reasons. It had been going on already for 50, 60 days. And that's why the F.B.I. decided to actually raid the compound. All those children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I remember very clearly walking around, everybody had their TVs turned on, and all you could see was flames. And we didn't know what was in the flames.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  McLarty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We all knew it was high risk and unpredictable. But certainly decisions had to be made to protect the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gearan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Everything is a case of first impression. In our case, it had been how many years since Democrats were in the executive branch? Our people had been governors and on the Hill. But in terms of the executive branch, the experience was very limited. So everything was through that freshness of the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And then there was the learning curve that many of Mr. Clinton's relatively young staff members had to reckon with as they went to work each day in the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Myers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Clinton, by nature, is informal. So the culture around him was informal -- much less formal than the Bush culture had been. Neither Bush ever entered the Oval Office without wearing a tie. We didn't know that. President Clinton would occasionally come to the Oval Office on weekends in a short-sleeve shirt. Some of us would come to work in jeans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When you're in the epicenter, the cathedral of American politics, everything you do communicates something.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gearan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I can remember being in a meeting. It was in the residence, and there are these half-moon-shaped windows. And I recalled seeing these black-and-white photos of Lyndon Johnson sitting in that same place. It's then you realize the enormity of the burdens on the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  George W. Bush</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Day 1 approval rating: 57 percent; Day 100: 62 percent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Feb. 17, 2001: Compared with the roiling 2000 vote recount, Mr. Bush's first 100 days seemed off to a tame enough start. Then, barely a month in, he ordered the bombing of Iraqi military installations that President Saddam Hussein was using to interfere with American and British patrols of no-fly zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Andrew H. Card Jr., chief of staff</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We had great discipline. We had a very detailed plan for what the first 100 days should look like, a template: two foreign trips, this economic summit, the cadences of what you have to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His first trip was to Mexico. And here we are at [President] Vicente Fox's farm, which was like a ranch, but he called it a farm. We're getting ready to have a news conference, and all of a sudden I get word that the Defense Department has fired a missile at a radar site in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ari Fleischer, press secretary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We're at Fox's ranch. And Campbell Brown [NBC News White House correspondent] comes up to me and says, ''Why are you bombing Iraq?'' I said, ''What do you mean?'' And she said, ''There's a bombing raid going on in Iraq, and you don't know about it?'' So I go into the lunch and pull Condi [Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser] out, and said, ''Are we bombing Iraq?'' She said no. Then Condi and I go into a secure room. Condi calls Rumsfeld [Donald H. Rumsfeld, the defense secretary] and sure enough. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Karen P. Hughes, counselor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I just remember being totally surprised. I knew our pilots were enforcing the no-fly zone in Iraq. What I didn't know was that the military had recommended that we take a little more aggressive action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was the first state visit designed to show that the Bush administration was making our relationship with Mexico and Latin America a priority. Here we are at an event designed to showcase one message, and all of a sudden the message is something else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fleischer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was all ignored. Everything was dominated by the U.S. bombing Iraq. So that meeting was wiped out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  April 1, 2001: A Navy intelligence plane collided in midair with a Chinese fighter jet near the island of Hainan, forcing the American pilot to make an emergency landing and leading to a standoff between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Card</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I remember we had a plan for April, the last month of the 100 days. All of a sudden Slobodan Milosevic gets arrested. And then, I think it was also April 1 or April 2 you had the Chinese force the EP-3 down on Hainan Island. Neither of those were in our 100-day plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hughes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I still remember looking up at CNN and seeing the banner headline ''Spy Plane Standoff.'' I came from a governor's office, and most things you do in a governor's office don't show up on CNN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fleischer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That was huge. An EP-3 routine espionage mission over the coast of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Chinese were increasingly aggressive about stopping those missions from taking place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The EP-3 blew a hole in the side, and then a frantic mission went on aboard the plane to destroy all the confidential information. And the closest runway was a Chinese air base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Bush had a lot of latitude to resolve it peacefully. And if something like that did happen, it's an obvious and immediate test of [President] </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We ended up drafting a statement that had the word ''sorry'' in it. We said it wasn't an apology. We were just sorry that it happened. The Chinese said it was an apology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It was not long, former Bush aides said, before the reality sank in that they were not in a campaign anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Card</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  During the transition you're not dealing with any crises. During the campaign you are dealing with some, but they're political crises. There are not lives at stake. The world doesn't understand. And they will test you. And you have to deal with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Hughes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  You feel it every day when you walk into the White House, the Oval Office, when you see the president. But that moment when young American lives were at risk, you felt it fully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And then you drive to the White House the very first day. And I remember getting up in my hotel room that day. I was brushing my teeth and my husband walked in and I said, ''I'm going to work at the White House today.'' He looked at me like I was crazy. But I'm thinking, ''I'm just a normal person.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fleischer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's a regular part of White House life. You're just minding your business, going about your day, and something routine goes terribly wrong in some part of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Barack Obama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Approval rating Day 1: 68 percent; Day 100: 65 percent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jan. 20, 2009: Mr. Obama entered the presidency facing the gravest threat to the country's economic stability in 80 years and quickly got to work on a rescue plan that would not always prove popular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rahm Emanuel, chief of staff</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We knew we were going into one of the worst economic moments since the Great Depression. The financial markets were frozen. The auto industry was about to implode. And that's just on the domestic side. Those were the knowns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  David Axelrod, senior adviser</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was a sense of absolute urgency of the situation that was drummed into us by these economic reports. Eight hundred thousand jobs lost just in the month of January. Summers [Lawrence Summers, lead White House economic adviser] said we're going to lose millions of more jobs. Orszag [Peter Orszag, the White House budget director] said this will add trillions to the debt. It was a staggering time. And that's before you ever get to 180,000 troops in two theaters of war. One thing was clear: There was no time to ease into the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jim Messina, deputy chief of staff</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We thought in the first 100 days we needed to make real progress on the economic stuff. It's why he got elected and everyone was pushing very hard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We had to be able to walk and chew gum. We had to get the committees to work on health care and on the energy bill, too. For us it wasn't ever going to be one signature piece of legislation in the first 100 days. We were never going to do that. We've got to get a bunch of planes in the air. And that turned out to be messier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  March 29, 2009: The White House set stringent conditions for the American automakers General Motors and Chrysler to receive an extension of federal assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Messina</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the middle of this, it was about the same time the car companies started to fail. Saving Midwestern manufacturing was incredibly important. But those were really tough calls. There was not a lot of public support, after bank bailouts, for a round of car company bailouts. History will judge that as one of the most important decisions he made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Emanuel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I always think that the word ''bailout'' was not the right word. I argued for ''restructuring.'' It was a bad term. It connoted that people were getting something for free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What the president really said at the end of the day was, ''If you need resources, here are the conditions for it.'' And it forced the financial sector, labor, suppliers, dealers to come to the table and make changes that, for too long, they deferred. And now you can see the end result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a lot of people said, ''You're throwing good money after bad.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Axelrod</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was no guarantee that it would work. Everybody looks back at it now like it was a no-brainer, but there was a lot of money involved and public opinion was very much against.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  April 8, 2009: Somali pirates hijacked an American cargo ship, the Maersk Alabama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Emanuel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That was not in the handbook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Messina</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was always something. I remember very early when the pirates happened and [Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.] walked in to the senior advisers meeting and said, ''What's next? Pestilence?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Axelrod</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When the pirate thing happened, the president was given 10 minutes to decide whether to authorize the Navy SEALs to take a shot at the pirates. The SEALs were on the water 100 yards away. They said, ''We think we can get the pirates, but we might hit [Capt. Richard Phillips]. And you have 10 minutes.'' That's a day in the life of a president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even for a White House team that expected the worst and prepared for it, something unexpected always cropped up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Emanuel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There were the crises du jour of the knowns, and the crises du jour of the unknowns while you're making your way through setting up your team and your operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Axelrod</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The one thing that you learn very quickly in the White House is that on any given day something can happen -- and will happen -- that can take you off of your plan. I don't think people appreciate exactly how complex and challenging the presidency is.</SPAN></P>
