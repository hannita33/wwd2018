<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reading, Pa. -- KEITH MANDICH had been to this theater before, to see John Mellencamp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Mr. Mandich, a retired steelworker, was back in downtown Reading, Pa., to see another guy he thought of as a hero for working-class America: Senator Bernie Sanders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In his bid for the Democratic nomination, Mr. Sanders has nurtured vocal support from young, college-educated liberals. But he also has fervent support from people who remember the era of well-paying union jobs at manufacturing plants -- and who are very aware of how far we are from that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I just like Bernie because he's old like me,'' joked Mack Richards, 70, another retired steelworker at the Reading event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Pennsylvania is among the five states holding a primary on Tuesday, and it has the most delegates at stake. Since neither party has locked up its nominee yet, the state's white working-class voters have more of a voice in the primary process than they have had in years past. In 2008, they were considered Biden voters -- the white working-class denizens of Scranton, Pa., and places like it -- whom Joe Biden, Scranton's own, was supposed to win over for Barack Obama.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This time around, the fight for these voters has focused significantly on a somewhat unlikely contender for juiciest campaign issue: international trade deals and their repercussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Any presidential candidate on the stump knows how to work a good metaphor into a speech, and Mr. Sanders knew to use the very ZIP code he was rallying in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In many ways, what is happening here in Reading, what has happened over the last several decades, is kind of a metaphor for what's happening all over this country,'' Mr. Sanders told the crowd. ''We have seen a city which once had thousands of excellent-paying jobs lose those jobs because of disastrous trade policies.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He went on to list corporations, including the Dana Corporation, that had shut down plants in Reading and moved overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Mandich, the Sanders supporter and Mellencamp fan, said that he was laid off from his job at the Dana Corporation, which manufactured automobile frames, when the company closed its Reading plant in 2000. The Dana Corporation was one of the companies that supported the Clinton administration's effort to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement, which activists and liberal economists argue did more harm than good to the United States economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Kevin Wright, a high school physics teacher in line to see Mr. Sanders, saw parallels between the populism on the left and similar sentiments on the right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We're the response to the Tea Party,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His sister, standing next to him, laughed nervously. ''Careful!'' she warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Tea Party has taken over the Republican Party,'' Mr. Wright continued. ''I think our movement's stronger, and has more numbers, and is more rational and grounded in reality. And you can see that just based on the people here.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The crowd in Reading skewed a bit older than a typical Sanders rally -- possibly because it took place on a weekday afternoon. Fritz Von Hummel, 55, a self-employed appliance technician who was laid off from his previous job in November, canceled a couple of appointments to come to the event. He said he had not had health insurance for the past seven years because he could not afford it, and he was eager to talk about the shortcomings of President Obama's signature health care law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I'm just furious with the situation the way it is,'' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There was more fury elsewhere in Pennsylvania. Driving directly from a Bernie Sanders rally to a Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally is an easy way to get political whiplash. The two candidates couldn't be further apart on the political spectrum. Mr. Sanders was introduced by a young undocumented student who tearfully spoke about wanting to come ''out of the shadows.'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> opened his rally at an expo center in Harrisburg with his familiar ''build that wall'' refrain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At both rallies, four similar grievances emerged among their supporters, over health care, Social Security, campaign finance and trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Pennsylvania's recent presidential voting record is quite blue, that could change in 2016. Since the beginning of the year, roughly 165,000 Pennsylvanians changed their voter registration, according to state election officials. The biggest shift came from voters switching to the Republican Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At his rally in Harrisburg, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> asserted that Harrisburg had lost nearly 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001, and pledged to bring back jobs from countries like Mexico, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japan, Vietnam and India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Pennsylvania has taken harder hits on trade than just about anywhere else in the United States. Not good! The state of Pennsylvania has lost more than 35 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001. Not good,'' he said. ''Mexico has been taking your companies like it's candy from a baby.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rally in Harrisburg let out, supporters clashed with protesters separated by a line of police officers. The two groups flung chants back and forth. From the pro-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> side: ''Baby killers!'' ''Bernie sucks!'' ''Build that wall!'' And from the anti-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> side: ''Black lives matter!'' ''Go to college!'' ''Get more chants!''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jennifer Poole, a self-employed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporter from Port Royal, Pa., couldn't get into the rally, so she watched him outside on her phone instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I don't know what has made these people feel that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is racist and he's not, he's clearly not,'' Ms. Poole said. ''I was never a registered voter until now. I really believe that he can do great things and turn the world around. I really do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In conversations with both Sanders and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters, the same questions kept coming up: What do you do if you're a middle-aged factory worker who has made a decent living for most of your life, only to see not only your job, but your entire industry, go up in smoke? Do you go to college? Take on a lower-paying job? Retire early? Or just hope that something better comes along, someday?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Neither party seems to have a monopoly on the answers. Mr. Mandich, the Sanders supporter, said if it came down to a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Clinton election in November, he would not vote for Mrs. Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I probably would go for Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
