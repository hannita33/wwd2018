<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;A meeting last week with Indian developers highlights the potential for conflict stemming from his businesses and his role as president.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correction Appended</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PUNE, India - It is a daunting proposition to put $2 million apartments on the market in Pune - a quiet industrial city in the west of India, where even the fanciest neighborhoods are lined with squat housing blocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the developers of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Towers Pune, an elegant pair of 23-story black-glass pillars, have an extraordinary new marketing tool they are moving quickly to exploit: the president-elect of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won the presidency, they have celebrated the growth that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> win could bring to their brand, even flying to New York last week to meet with the president-elect and his family as he was assembling his cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will see a tremendous jump in valuation in terms of the second tower,&quot; said Pranav R. Bhakta, a consultant who helped Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> organization make inroads into the Indian market five years ago. &quot;To say, 'I have a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> flat or residence' - it's president-elect branded. It's that recall value. If they didn't know </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> before, they definitely know him now.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Towers~ Pune pic.twitter.com/RYkYNs16kL - Ren (@iKartikeymishra) October 23, 2016</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In just under nine weeks, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will take control of a portfolio of public business between the United States and India, the world's two largest democracies, supervising debates over issues including climate change, maritime shadowboxing with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the nuclear standoff with Pakistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting shows that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not fully disengaged from his business ventures even as he leads his presidential transition, and it highlights the potential conflicts he will face going forward if he does not separate himself from a brand that has been constructed around his persona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a telephone interview, Atul Chordia, one of the developers who met last week with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, played down the appointment as a &quot;two-minute&quot; congratulatory conversation in which no business was transacted and no new projects were discussed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But newspapers in India reported it as a business meeting, illustrated with a photograph of the beaming real estate executives - Atul Chordia, Sagar Chordia and Kalpesh Mehta - flanking the future president, and indicated that the builders and Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> organization are planning further collaborative real estate projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sagar Chordia confirmed to The New York Times on Sunday that this account of the meeting in New York - which included discussions with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family about possible additional real estate deals - was accurate. A spokeswoman for the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization did not dispute this account - saying only that the encounter with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> himself was brief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have identified a piece of land and spoken to them,&quot; Sagar Chordia told The Business Standard, a daily newspaper in India. Sagar Chordia, who posted photos of himself wearing a &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; hat on social media during the presidential campaign, did not respond to repeated requests for comment from The Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three prominent ethics lawyers said in interviews on Sunday that the interaction between Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his business partners from India does not appear to violate federal laws or ethics rules, nor would it even if he had already been sworn in. This is in part because the president, unlike members of Congress and most other federal employees, is exempt from such requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But each lawyer agreed the activities created the appearance that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his business partners are using his status as a way to profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is unprecedented in modern history,&quot; said Andrew D. Herman, a lawyer who has represented more than a dozen members of Congress in ethics cases. &quot;But this is the new normal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert S. Stern, a lawyer who helped write California's ethics law and the former president of the nonprofit Center for Governmental Studies, said that anytime Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has a meeting with a foreign government leader where one of his projects is based - a list that includes Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, Canada, Panama, Dubai, the Philippines, South Korea and Uruguay - questions may arise as to whether he took any action that might benefit his investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It already looks like he is using his position as president-elect to promote something in India that would benefit him financially,&quot; Mr. Stern said. &quot;It is not presidential - or at least presidential before him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team, declined on Sunday to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman from the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization declined to address questions about the appropriateness of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> meeting with his business partners, and instead pointed to a statement the organization made last week about shifting control of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> business operations to his children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a top priority at the organization, and the structure that is ultimately selected will comply with all applicable rules and regulations,&quot; said Amanda Miller, the vice president of marketing at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pune towers are the first </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-branded project to be completed in India, to be followed in the next few years by a 75-story skyscraper in Mumbai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> five current projects in India are worth around $1.5 billion, making it Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> most active development market outside North America, Mr. Mehta, the managing director at Tribeca Developers and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organization's representative in India, told The Indian Express last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In most cases, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not invest in the projects, but instead allows the developers to use his name in return for an undisclosed sum in royalties, according to industry analysts. Though each agreement is structured differently, in many cases the brand receives a percentage of sales, meaning Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> stands to benefit directly from increased revenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publicity materials focus heavily on Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his family. One pitch promises that &quot;the experience of owning a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-branded property and living the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> lifestyle is unparalleled.&quot; Customers requesting information about the units receive an email illustrated with a large photograph of Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> elder daughter, seated thoughtfully before a window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name, Sagar Chordia told The Business Standard, is so valuable that apartments in the towers sell for 35percent more than comparable apartments in other developments. Similar projects have been undertaken by Armani, the Four Seasons and the Ritz Carlton, said Ramesh Nair, chief operating officer and international director at Jones Lang LaSalle Property Consultants, a global real estate company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a branding project,&quot; Mr. Nair said. &quot;There is no skin in the game. You are lending your name. You give some specifications for the project. And you will generate some free publicity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But sharing your brand name with Indian developers could backfire. Over the past decade, many unscrupulous developers here allowed projects to stall midway for lack of ready capital and used home buyers' deposits to begin work on the next project, leaving families stripped of their savings to protest helplessly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Nair said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> so far had partnered with well-regarded firms, but warned that a poor choice could damage not only Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reputation, but that of the United States, given the corruption typical of Indian land deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If that small university can get him into trouble, you can imagine what could happen with India's 'squeaky-clean' real estate sector,&quot; Mr. Nair said, referring to the fraud lawsuit against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University, which Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> settled last week for $25 million. &quot;Tomorrow they could have 100 buyers standing outside the U.S. Consulate, saying, 'Give me back my money.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry observers differed on whether Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brand image would help increase real estate sales. India's luxury housing market has been weak for years, and has been further damaged by a new government drive to stamp out untaxed cash transactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, some boldface names have reportedly purchased units at the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Towers Pune, including the Bollywood actors Rishi Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chordia family, which has close ties to Sharad Pawar, the chief of India's Nationalist Congress Party, is particularly enthusiastic in its embrace of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has made targeted appeals to Indian-Americans for financial support, holding a major fund-raising event in October in Edison, N.J., a city with a large number of Indian residents, where Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> called himself &quot;a big fan of Hindu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the morning of the election, Sagar Chordia described giving a party for 800 people in honor of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first visit there, in 2014. Vijayta Lalwani, a local journalist who interviewed Sagar Chordia as the final results came in, described him as &quot;ecstatic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Bhakta, the former consultant to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> development group, said he was confident that more collaborations were forthcoming. He said Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> son Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jr. has typically taken the lead on advancing deals in India, but that the president-elect also spends ample time with Indian partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every time I have been there with clients from India, we always have a heart-to-heart with Senior,&quot; he said. &quot;He is very much passionate about the India story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many in Pune said they believed demand for the apartments would rise. Mohan Devasi, 21, a laborer, said he had been impressed by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when he &quot;caught a glimpse of him&quot; in Pune in 2014. He had heard Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was &quot;a close friend of Narendra Modi&quot; and that he had promised to take a hard line on Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is right now the American president, which means he is the most powerful person in the world,&quot; said Partha Sikder, 25. &quot;He'll have that liberty. People will obviously want the apartments more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> real estate partners are also taking steps to keep the focus on the president-elect. Sagar Chordia told reporters from The Indian Express that he is planning to attend Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inauguration in January.</SPAN></P>
