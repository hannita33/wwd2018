</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;If he chooses, the new president could move on steel to back up his campaign rhetoric. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has fewer options but could aim at jetliners and carmakers.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHANGHAI - As a candidate, Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> aimed some of his most blistering words at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, declaring that &quot;we already have a trade war&quot; and suggesting ominously that &quot;we have the power over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, economic power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As president of the United States, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> can use trade - a cornerstone of his populist rise - as a weapon, with the potential to drastically reshape the world's two largest economies, as well as the companies, industries and workers who depend on their hundreds of billions of dollars in closely linked goods. But neither side may win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cutting off trade will not bring back the bulk of American manufacturing jobs lost to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in previous decades as it became the world's factory floor. Already, some industries that left the United States years ago, such as garment making and some light manufacturing, are now leaving </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for even cheaper places. An aggressive stance with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also risks antagonizing an authoritarian government with its own brand of economic nationalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the unsettling reality for Beijing is that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has a variety of ways to get back at </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for trade practices that he, his supporters or people in the affected industries view as unfair. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sells a large array of goods to the United States that he can aim at for higher tariffs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opportunities for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to retaliate would be more limited. In the most basic terms, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> buys less from the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could make some strategic strikes at targets like Boeing, American automakers and American farmers. Beijing exerts tight control over </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> airlines, for example, and sometimes steers contracts to Airbus, Boeing's European rival, when officials feel that Washington is uncooperative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Boeing complains, 'We have been pretty good friends with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Why are we always a target?'&quot; said He Weiwen, a former Chinese commerce ministry official who is now the co-director of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-U.S.-E.U. Study Center at the influential </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Association of International Trade in Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could wreak havoc on the vast yet delicate supply chain behind a wide range of products like iPhones and auto parts. Six years ago, Chinese restrictions on exports of obscure yet vital minerals led to a global outcry by manufacturers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early indications are that trade could take a more prominent place on the White House's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> agenda, which under President Obama was dominated by Beijing's territorial claims in East Asia and its influence over North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a strong signal, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has turned to Dan DiMicco, a longtime steel executive and trade critic, to oversee trade issues during his administration's transition. Mr. DiMicco writes a personal blog, liberally sprinkled with exclamation points, that blames America's industrial decline on cheating by trade partners, particularly </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hillary Clinton has claimed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> trade policies will start a 'Trade War' but what she fails to recognize is we are already in one,&quot; he wrote on his blog last summer. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> clearly sees it and he will work to put an end to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Mercantilist Trade War'! A war it has been waging against us for nearly 2 decades!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over the last two days has emphasized that a healthy relationship would benefit both sides. On Thursday, Lu Kang, a spokesman for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign Ministry, said, &quot;It is in the common interests of both countries to develop a long-term, stable and prosperous trading relationship, and any American politician would take a policy in the interest of his country and the American people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> views veer widely from the free-trade positions of the Republican Party in recent years and signal a return to the more hawkish positions of the Reagan administration, which repeatedly went after Japan on trade issues. Since President Ronald Reagan, Republican and Democratic administrations have been reluctant to confront countries that may be subsidizing or dumping exports, either because the evidence is unclear or because of a risk of damaging diplomatic or strategic relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the kind of stuff you learn in law school, and in the early days of your law career,&quot; said Alan H. Price, a longtime lawyer for the American steel and aluminum industries at Wiley Rein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When used, the measures were sometimes deemed ineffective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one rare example, President Obama used his powers to impose tariffs of up to 35 percent on imports of Chinese tires soon after he took office. The tariffs prompted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to impose steep tariffs on American chicken meat and automotive products. Both countries complained to the World Trade Organization, which mostly sided with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case resulted in the United States producing more tires, but imports from other countries rose even faster. And the Obama administration later became more cautious about challenging </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with trade restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any trade actions by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would face limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, he mentioned imposing a tariff of 45 percent on all imports from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. But he later avoided specifics - and he has limited power to do so anyway. The law allows him to impose tariffs of no more than 15 percent, and for as long as 150 days, on all imports, unless a national emergency is declared. Other laws allow him to impose tariffs on targeted goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> want to signal an aggressive stance quickly, he could move against imports of steel and aluminum from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The Obama administration has been preparing to file a World Trade Organization case against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> over claims that it subsidized aluminum exports. And the United States, Japan and the European Union already complain that Chinese government subsidies have produced a bloated domestic steel industry that they say dumps millions of tons of excess goods on world markets each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is more vulnerable given the sheer amount of stuff it sells to America. For more than a decade, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has consistently exported about $4 worth of goods to the United States for each $1 of goods that it imports. Exports to the United States represent about 4 percent of the Chinese economy; American exports to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are only about two-thirds of 1 percent of the United States economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have many things in the toolbox for retaliation, because we export more than we import,&quot; said Mr. He, the former Chinese commerce ministry official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could inflict pain on sensitive areas that provide American jobs, like Boeing's jetliners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boeing declined to comment except to say, &quot;We congratulate President-elect </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and newly elected members of Congress and look forward to working with them to make sure we continue to grow the global economy and protect our people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Motors and Ford Motor consider </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a big contributor to sales. They mostly manufacture in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to supply the domestic market. But much of the design and engineering work is still done in the United States. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> could hurt the automakers by adopting domestic policies that help their big European rivals, notably Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other American companies may be less opposed to trade limits than in the past. Some American companies have been struggling to sell in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Beijing has steered contracts to Chinese telecommunications companies after Edward Snowden's revelations about American intelligence gathering in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. And Chinese state-owned enterprises have shifted much of their investment banking business from Wall Street to homegrown rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American farmers have welcomed Chinese purchases, but it is unclear how badly they could be hurt by any trade action. Chicken meat, soybeans, corn and other foodstuffs are commodities traded in world markets, and farmers are often able to sell elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese goods have long helped keep prices down for Americans. But Chinese exports play a shrinking role in holding down prices as labor costs rise in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and as rivals like Indonesia, Vietnam and India expand manufacturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> biggest potential weapon is to disrupt the supply chains of multinationals by halting exports of crucial materials or components. But that could damage </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reputation as a reliable supplier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think we will go that far at the moment, because there is a lot of room to negotiate,&quot; Mr. He said. &quot;If we are forced too much, nothing can be excluded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
