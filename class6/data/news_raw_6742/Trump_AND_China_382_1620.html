<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz questioned the Republican front-runner&amp;#8217;s ideas, ethics and conservative credentials at Thursday&amp;#8217;s debate. <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well that was fun. And why didn't it happen months ago?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz went hammer and tongs after Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> at Thursday night's Republican debate in Houston, questioning his ideas, ethics, business practices, and conservative credentials. Marco Rubio led the charge, grinning broadly as he lambasted Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for hiring undocumented workers, making his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-branded clothing in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and failing to release his tax returns. Scoffing at Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> outsized boasts about his wealth, Mr. Rubio said: &quot;If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be right now? Selling watches in Manhattan.&quot; The audience erupted in laughter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, one of the most sustained, resonant attacks was on an issue that's been out there for months: multiple lawsuits against Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> so-called &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University.&quot; Mr. Rubio called the enterprise a &quot;fake university.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are people that borrowed $36,000 to go to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University, and they're suing now,&quot; he said. &quot;And you know what they got? They got to take a picture with a cardboard cutout of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Cruz jumped in, asking voters to consider what it would be like to have Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the G.O.P. nominee, testifying as a defendant in a multi-million-dollar fraud case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Google searches of &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University&quot; went through the roof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was left sputtering, with nothing to say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressed repeatedly on when he'd release his tax returns, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, who has resisted doing so, found a new excuse. He is being audited, and can't release the returns until the audit is complete (which of course he could.) After the debate, he suggested that he gets audited repeatedly because of his religion. As Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> himself would say (on Twitter): Bad!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Rubio even found time to ridicule Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for repeating himself, and for his near-total lack of substance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All in all, this last debate before the crucial Super Tuesday primaries on March 1&nbsp;was a delightful, long-overdue trouncing of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Whether it will cut into his substantial lead is, of course, the race's biggest question.</SPAN></P>
