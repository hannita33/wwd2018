<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FROM: DIRECTOR  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  TO: WRITER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  O.K., look, I know I've been out of the country and out of touch for more than a year. And yes, I was pleased you were finally sending me a comedy feature, not a documentary idea or a script based on a board game, app or piece of cutlery. But frankly your ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">: Rise of The Donald'' idea is the most ill-conceived movie pitch I have ever received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1) Your central character -- ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">/The Donald'' -- is just TOO BROAD. There may be a taste for a supersize American-cheese blowhard fantasy compendium of all the ills of Western civilization poured into one guy, but you need a MUCH lighter touch.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  2) TONE. The tone is all over the place. You can go satirical (implying your rival's father shot J.F.K.). You can go surrealist (the rants). You can go gross-out (the menstrual blood). You can go dark (the white nationalist delegate). BUT NOT ALL IN ONE MOVIE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3) The physical attributes of ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">/The Donald'' are way overblown. ''The coarse cotton candy thatch of synthetic mane'' -- perhaps doable. But to ladle on the ''broiled ham visage, toasted golden under the sun lamp'' is just FAR TOO MUCH. Even in the dystopia you paint, he needs to be a believable candidate, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  4) ''Build that wall'' needs another pass (or five!) as your imagined rallying cry. I'm afraid to say it is sophomoric in its satirical obviousness. Honestly, this moronic version of the imagined right will do your liberal cause more harm than good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  5) From here on in the implausibilities metastasize. ''He is not a war hero, he's a dummy''? REALLY? About the character who spent two years in solitary confinement? And this is meant to play as something other than a career ender? That's just a bit silly, O.K.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  6) Even in a ''knockabout'' comedy, that a serious candidate could suggest barring the entry of all Muslims to the United States is not funny because there's no RING OF TRUTH. You've just got to try harder. Also, I personally would not feel good polluting the world with this kind of racist fear-mongering even as satire. You just never know how this material will play in the real world!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  7) Likewise, and I'm getting tired pointing out all the holes in your story, but a candidate who referred to Mexicans en masse as ''rapists''? Yeah? Really? ''Ha-ha-ha.'' Sorry. Dead on Day 1 of the campaign. You see there really does need to be some thread of logic to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">/The Donald's crazy/zany sayings, otherwise it starts to feel like the character you have invented can say anything. I'm not Bu&ntilde;uel. I don't do dreamscapes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  8) The descent into violence of the campaign? I guess. If you must. But in the middle of the second act he is already goading his disciples into cathartic violence? It leaves you nowhere to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  9) It may do for some collegiate parody to have a bloated plutocrat bragging about his ''size'' in a presidential nomination debate, but for a proper piece of work? You need to up your game!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  10) Sloppy plot alert! Please, think! Is it really plausible that the Republican bigwigs you have denouncing ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">' just fold and accept him once he seals the nomination? And your fictive polls show support for him growing? No! See by this point in your story you've had lots of ''fun'' as your </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> character has alienated Latinos, women and African-Americans (not having him immediately reject K.K.K. endorsement is in bad taste -- obviously a cut). I'm sorry, but your plot doesn't make sense. There must be consequences to your character's actions. That is screenwriting 101.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  11) Finally: endings. It was a shame you sent this through before deciding on your finale. For the record, I actually kind of enjoyed the presidential debate break-down-naked-rant sequence. Haunting! But I think there's something in the simple: Nomination -- Victory -- Trade War -- Paranoid Freakout -- Exchange of Thermonuclear Weapons With </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> variation. One of the more believable elements!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over all -- trash. Page one rewrite.</SPAN></P>
