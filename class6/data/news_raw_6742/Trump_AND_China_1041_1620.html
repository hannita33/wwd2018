<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Roger Ailes Negotiates His Departure as Chairman of Fox News | Embracing Populism as Policy <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL SEEK TO BLOCK 2 HEALTH INSURANCE MERGERS The Justice Department is preparing lawsuits to block the merger of Aetna with Humana and Anthem's purchase of Cigna, Leslie Picker and Reed Abelson report in DealBook. Antitrust officials are concerned that Aetna's $37 billion deal with Humana and Anthem's $48 billion pursuit of Cigna will hurt competition in the health insurance industry, a person briefed on the matter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deals would have reduced the ranks of the largest insurers to three from five.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg, which earlier reported the suits, that antitrust officials were unlikely to be persuaded by offers from the companies to sell assets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawsuits would be the latest in a series of challenges to mergers that the government perceives to be anticompetitive. Similar concerns prompted the end of the proposed $35 billion tie-up between the oil-field services companies Baker Hughes and Halliburton. Antitrust concerns also thwarted the $6.3 billion merger between Staples and Office Depot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Justice Department succeeds, Anthem would have to pay a $1.85 billion breakup fee to Cigna and Aetna would have to give $1 billion to Humana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors have suspected for some time that trouble was brewing for the Anthem-Cigna deal, because of fighting between the two companies. But the Aetna-Humana deal was given better odds because the companies could divest themselves of businesses where they had too much market share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROGER AILES NEGOTIATES HIS DEPARTURE AS CHAIRMAN OF FOX NEWS Roger Ailes and 21st Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News, are in the advanced stages of discussions about Mr. Ailes's stepping down from his role as chairman, John Koblin and Jim Rutenberg report in The New York Times. Susan Estrich, one of Mr. Ailes's lawyers, said the terms could include Mr. Ailes staying on in a consulting role, but nothing had been completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discussions come after Gretchen Carlson, a former anchor, filed a sexual harassment suit against Mr. Ailes, which in turn prompted an internal review at 21st Century Fox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A departure could be a humbling and startlingly sudden fall from power for Mr. Ailes, who started Fox News from scratch 20 years ago and built it into a profitable top-rated cable news network as well as a leading platform for conservative politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of Mr. Ailes's impending exit landed like a shock wave at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where many of the nation's leading television executives and personalities were gathered in tight quarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rupert Murdoch has been in constant contact with his sons, James and Lachlan, on the matter and all three had agreed on Mr. Ailes's fate, according to a person familiar with the matter. Although Mr. Ailes has had a successful partnership with Rupert Murdoch, he has had disagreements with James and Lachlan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ON THE AGENDA Morgan Stanley will publish its second-quarter results at 7 a.m. Qualcomm's conference call on its third-quarter earnings starts at 4:30 p.m. Intel will hold a conference call on its latest quarterly earnings at 5:30 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EMBRACING POPULISM AS POLICY Theresa May's vision for a corporate Britain, which she outlined just before she became prime minister, is more Bernie Sanders than Margaret Thatcher, Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in Deal Professor She calls for more protectionism, a greater say for workers, more vigorous antitrust enforcement and limitations on pay for chief executives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has argued that communities should be taken into account when foreign companies attempt takeovers. Ms. May has also urged that Britain should adopt regulations requiring companies to publish the ratio of pay between their chief executives and their employees' median pay. She has called for a more rigorous antitrust regime in markets like banking and utilities too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is more than populist political talk, Mr. Davidoff Solomon writes. The changes she described, tying corporations more closely to the state, represent a significant shift from the generally laissez-faire positions the Conservatives have held since the time of Mrs. Thatcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With similar problems of inequality percolating in the United States, it may not be long before Ms. May's ideas are picked up there too. The only question is whether Democrats or Republicans will do so, Mr. Davidoff Solomon writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both parties have taken a leave out of the pages of the populist playbook already with their attacks on big banks, Jeff Sommer writes in Strategies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republicans inserted a plank in the party platform calling for the restoration of the Glass-Steagall Acts, a Depression-era law that separated commercial and investment banking but was repealed in 1999. A draft of the Democratic platform also calls for the restoration of Glass-Steagall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear that Glass-Steagall would have staved off the financial crisis had it remained in place, but the law has become a way for both parties to poke a finger in Wall Street's eye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These pronouncements may not mean much. Party platforms are often irrelevant. Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has not made Glass-Steagall a campaign theme and Hillary Clinton has expressed skepticism about the utility of reviving it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They may also want to be careful about attacking big banks right now. Who, after all, was the father of national banking in the United States? Alexander Hamilton, the founder of the first Bank of the United States, has become a populist hero and it might not be the smartest move to campaign against his well-heeled descendants, Mr. Sommer writes.</SPAN></P>
