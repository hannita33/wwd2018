<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 30 years ago, a cow set a record for the most milk produced in 24 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ubre Blanca (White Udder) was said to yield 110.9 liters, or 29 gallons, that day. Her master was Fidel Castro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The supercow is one of many tales Cubans will remember as they say goodbye to their longtime leader this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ubre Blanca was part of Mr. Castro's effort to solve a milk shortage. Long before Dolly the sheep or goats engineered to produce silk, Mr. Castro used artificial insemination to combine the Asian zebu's hardiness with a Holstein's high yield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ubre Blanca was born in 1972 to instant stardom. Daily reports of her progress became news, though in the end, she was more or less the only success from the breeding experiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Castro had a love for all things dairy, which included &quot;Cuban Camembert&quot; and a quest to build an ice cream parlor, Coppelia, to rival the American restaurant chain Howard Johnson's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His ice cream obsession was also the closest the United States got to a successful assassination attempt - poison was to be slipped into Mr. Castro's milkshake, but it froze to the side of the freezer instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Ubre Blanca, she died in 1985. A government official saluted her, saying, &quot;She gave her all for the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
