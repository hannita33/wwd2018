<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Here's what you need to know to start your day.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shooting reported at Ohio State University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least eight people were taken to the hospital this morning after reports of an &quot;active shooter&quot; on campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One person is in critical condition, fire department officials in Columbus said. Check back here for updates to this developing story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> criticizes recount effort.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said on Twitter on Sunday that millions of Americans had voted illegally, although he did not provide evidence. His comments are likely to reverberate this week as Hillary Clinton's campaign said it would participate in a review of Wisconsin's election results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts to seek recounts are also underway in Michigan and Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separately, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team remained divided over candidates for secretary of state. One of his top advisers spoke out publicly against Mitt Romney, a critic of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and a former Massachusetts governor under consideration for the post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> partners abroad and at home. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the holiday weekend, we examined the president-elect's ventures in the Philippines, India, Brazil and Turkey. Former U.S. officials have expressed concern that his dealings overseas could affect foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also traced the rise of Stephen K. Bannon from his years in the Navy and at Goldman Sachs to his courting of politicians who share his worldview. Mr. Bannon, whose critics call him racist, sexist and an Islamophobe, may have found in Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the vessel for the political and social upheaval he desires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cuba after Castro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government in Havana has announced nine days of national mourning for Fidel Castro, who died on Friday at 90.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allegiance to Mr. Castro and to the revolution he started has slipped from generation to generation across the country. Our reporter in Havana met one family torn over Mr. Castro's legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political scandals abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Park Geun-hye of South Korea stayed holed up in her official residence over the weekend and, through a spokesman, denied her involvement in an influence-peddling scandal that could lead to an impeachment vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Afghanistan, the vice president Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum is accused of beating and taking a political rival hostage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> North Dakota pipeline protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, citing safety concerns, plans to closeaccess to federal lands near the Dakota Access pipeline project by Dec. 5, according to a letter sent to the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency had previously said it would not evict protesters because of concerns for freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American retailers are gearing up for Cyber Monday with deals aimed at attracting online shoppers. Here's our guide to some of the season's most popular tech items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is Uber a taxi service or a digital platform? The European Court of Justice will consider that question this week as it determines how the company can operate across the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We recently looked at how billionaires laid the groundwork for increased legal assaults on the news media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can treat suing the press as an investment,&quot; our reporter observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. stocks were up on Friday. Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an upset, Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon, a former prime minister of France who has called for a crackdown on immigration, won a runoff vote to represent the center-right in the presidential election in the spring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victory sets up a possible face-off with the country's far-right party, which has received a lift from the triumph of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Israeli military said it had killed four militants linked to the Islamic State after they attacked Israeli forces in the Golan Heights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The confrontation appeared to be the first of its kind between Israel and ISIS-affiliated forces based in Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joe Corr&eacute;, son of the Sex Pistols' former manager, set fire to music memorabilia to protest Punk London, an event he considers too mainstream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Moana&quot; was No. 1 at the North American box office, becoming the second-best Thanksgiving opening on record, behind &quot;Frozen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Floating across the U.S.-Mexico border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A ferry in a small Texas town has been offering trips to and from Mexico for decades. Take a ride across the Rio Grande in our latest 360 video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than a chess tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A weekslong chess battle that could end today in New York City pits Sergey Karjakin of Russia against the defending world champion, Magnus Carlsen of Norway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions reminiscent of the Cold War have given the match geopolitical overtones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Born to move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our bodies, and specifically our hearts, want to be worked at least moderately, said a scientist who led a recent study on the cardiovascular health of a tribe in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A daily regimen of walking and lifting helped to protect hearts against disease, the study found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recipes of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you still have leftover turkey, here are three ways to use it: in a mole verde, in pho or for tikka masala. While you cook, read about New York's vanishing diner culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That banana you might be having for breakfast is probably a Cavendish, the most widely available variety of one of the world's most popular fruits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a deadly fungus is on the march, and the Cavendish's lack of genetic diversity is raising fears of a possible &quot;bananapocalypse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killer fungus, a strain of Panama Disease called Tropical Race 4, has spread to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Northern Territory of Australia, and it has recently been found in Africa and the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With its yellow peel and seedless fruit, the Cavendish makes up 95 percent of bananas sold worldwide, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous dominant variety, the Gros Michel, was decimated by another form of the fungus in the 1950s. Growers turned to the Cavendish, whose strength lies more in disease resistance than flavor. (One expert said it &quot;had been considered something close to junk.&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cavendish is thought to have arrived in England in the 1800s from Mauritius, taking its name from the family in whose greenhouse it was cultivated. Missionaries eventually carried it to the Pacific islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One scientist sees a silver lining in newly urgent efforts to save the seeds from wild bananas. &quot;Race 4 is a threat,&quot; he says, &quot;but it's also an opportunity to start growing more diversity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
