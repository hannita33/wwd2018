<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Finding products branded with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> name is easy in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finding someone who can impersonate President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING - Zou Dangrong knows he will have to &quot;orange up&quot; his man, if he is to convince </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that Tang Xinhua, a retired music professor, is Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the president-elect of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal is to get Mr. Tang looking enough like Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that he can impersonate the president-elect and entertain at lucrative company debuts, shopping mall openings and New Year's galas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steel yourselves: After a slew of made-in-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> products, including toilets and construction supplies, here comes a made-in-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zou specializes in finding Chinese who resemble famous politicians and can sing and act, then marketing them. He already has two Barack Obamas, several Kim Jong-uns and even a Vladimir V. Putin in his stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is all good, clean fun with high artistic standards, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A good </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> impersonator should look like him, be a talented performer, have a sense of humor, be tall and broad, outgoing and energetic,&quot; Mr. Zou said in a telephone interview from Yueyang, in Hunan Province, where his company, Hunan Dangrong Film and Television Media Center, is based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He should have the air of a celebrity,&quot; he said. &quot;Because the real </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is good at performing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zou requested that his future star not be contacted, saying Mr. Tang, 61, who is from the central Chinese province of Hubei, was not ready for the media spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zou also asked that the name of the music academy where Mr. Tang once taught not be disclosed, saying he was afraid it would make it easier for a bigger, richer agency to locate Mr. Tang and poach his services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zhu Dake, a professor and cultural critic at Tongji University in Shanghai, said that performers who could emulate celebrities and other public figures filled a real need in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. &quot;There's a large demand for impersonators,&quot; Professor Zhu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actors who can portray Communist leaders like Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai have long been needed for propaganda films, he said. That tradition continued as socialism morphed into money making after the Mao era, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now there are also demands for impersonators of Western celebrities for more casual, less serious films and performances,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zou's hunt for a Chinese Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> began after the real Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, received their parties' presidential nominations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For months, Mr. Zou received tips from a network of friends in the entertainment industry, he said. It was only this week, he said, that he found Mr. Tang, after Mr. Tang's wife recommended her husband for the role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how to make a Chinese man look like Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, whose complexion tends toward the florid, a tint rarely seen in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">? Mr. Zou acknowledged that it was an issue but that it was manageable with makeup artists and stylists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hair color can easily be changed with dye jobs - temporary color, not permanent, keeping it in for an hour or two,&quot; he said. &quot;We've asked tailors to make the same clothes that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wore in his campaign, though maybe from less expensive material.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zou faced similar aesthetic challenges with Xiao Jiguo, a former security guard who has had an extraordinarily successful career impersonating President Obama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet finding two Barack Obamas, as Mr. Zou ultimately did, was easier than finding one Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think making a successful </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> impersonator is more challenging than making an Obama impersonator,&quot; Mr. Zou said. He added that Mr. Obama had a reputation as a kind man, &quot;and it's easy for people to like him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But people's reactions to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are so different,&quot; he said. &quot;People who like him like him very much, but there are also so many people who dislike him just as much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, finding impersonators for Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, was easy, Mr. Zou said, and he has several.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Covering all possible outcomes in the presidential election, Mr. Zou said he also searched for a Clinton impersonator, but failed. &quot;Hillary looks very domineering, and that characteristic isn't common among Chinese women,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Zou said that he was optimistic about Mr. Tang's abilities. He speaks both English and Russian, which means &quot;We can make things high-end,&quot; Mr. Zou said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think if we turn </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> speeches into song lyrics, it would be funny and popular,&quot; he said. &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is funny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, according to Mr. Zou, Mr. Tang is keen to shine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wife &quot;said he liked performing, but he'd missed opportunities when he was young,&quot; Mr. Zou said. &quot;Now that he's retired he could give it a go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Particularly important though, is that Mr. Tang is only nine years younger than Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 70.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's better to be younger,&quot; Mr. Zou said. &quot;If he were older, I'd be worried about him going out and performing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noticeably missing from Mr. Zou's stable of would-be stars is an impersonator for President Xi Jinping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also have impersonators of Chinese leaders, such as Mao Zedong,&quot; Mr. Zou said. &quot;But we don't have Xi impersonators. Now is not the right time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese officials do not welcome comedy at their expense, and even good-humored satire is generally not permitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many companies have asked me to find impersonators for Xi and his wife, Peng,&quot; Mr. Zou said, referring to Peng Liyuan. &quot;But I think their events don't match Xi's image right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Xi has cultivated an image as an avuncular but stern figure, and a strong Communist leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That does not really suit a shopping mall opening, Mr. Zou said.</SPAN></P>
