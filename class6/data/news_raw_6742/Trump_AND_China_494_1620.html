<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW DELHI -- At a college fair on Wednesday at the Le M&eacute;ridien hotel here, 20 American universities made their pitches to aspiring students, many of whom had long hoped to study in the United States. But as the students checked out presentations from colleges ranging from the State University of New York at Binghamton to Abilene Christian University in Texas, several expressed concerns about going to America under a Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''It's the main topic of conversation among my friends,'' said Palak Gera, 21, who is applying to graduate programs in pharmaceutical science in North Carolina, Illinois and North Dakota. ''They don't want to apply to the U.S. under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.'' </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Aman Kumar, 18, who is looking at universities in California, said, ''In his campaign, he's discriminating against Muslim and other brown and black people,'' adding, ''I'm thinking of applying to Canada.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This year, the number of international students in United States colleges surpassed one million for the first time, bringing more than $32 billion a year into the economy and infusions of money to financially struggling colleges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  College admissions officials in the United States caution that it is too early to draw firm conclusions about overseas applications, because deadlines for applications are generally in January and February. But they are worried that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> election as president could portend a drop in international candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Canadian universities have already detected a postelection surge in interest from overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We have seen an increase in applications from the U.S. and from international students in the last week,'' Jocelyne Younan, the director of global undergraduate recruitment at McGill University in Montreal, wrote in an email. ''We've also seen an increase in students inquiring about McGill on social media.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Traffic on a University of Toronto website for international applicants surged the day after the election, officials there said -- and most of it came from Americans. ''Visits to our recruitment website from the U.S. are typically around 1,000 a day,'' said Ted Sargent, the university's vice president, international. ''On Nov. 9, that spiked to 10,000.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the same day, there was an increase in visitors from Britain and India, Mr. Sargent said. ''Our positive message as a university, but also as a city and a country, definitely is about openness to people from around the world and a real inclusiveness,'' he said. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A disruption in the flow of international students could be particularly worrisome for universities that balance their books with income from international students, who generally pay higher tuition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At Indiana State University, 1,000 of the 13,500 students are foreign, including many Saudis who transferred this year from Idaho State, and officials are concerned, said Santhana Naidu, an associate vice president for communications and marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We have already received inquiries from prospective students who are in the applicant pool,'' Mr. Naidu said. ''They're asking, 'Is it safe for me to come there?' and generally getting the lay of the land.'' Mr. Naidu will be among officials meeting this week at the university, in Terre Haute, to determine what they can do to assuage fears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Scott Manning, the director of global programs at Susquehanna University, a liberal arts college in Selinsgrove, Pa., said he had heard before the election that two prospective students from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were waiting until after the vote to submit visa documents necessary to attend Susquehanna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They were kind of spooked about threats </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> made about the South </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sea, back and forth with Japan about some uninhabited islands, and trade issues in general,'' Mr. Manning said. The students, who were considering an English-language program beginning in January as a precursor to fall enrollment, have still not submitted their documents, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Officials at Ohio State University said it was too early to tell whether the election result would affect international applications, adding that there had been an increase so far this year, although most were received before Election Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  International study has historically been affected by social forces. Attacks on Indian students in Australia in 2009 and 2010 were believed to be part of the reason for a sharp drop-off in applications from India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  International education experts first raised concerns in May about the election of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, when a study was presented at a meeting of Nafsa: Association of International Educators indicating that a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> presidency could dissuade international students from coming to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The study, by Intead and FPP EDU Media, two companies specializing in international student recruitment for colleges, found that 60 percent of international prospective students would be less likely to attend a college in the United States if Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> were elected. ''We were really surprised, if not shocked, by the results,'' said Benjamin Waxman, the chief executive of Intead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More recently, international education experts who have been in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and India -- the two biggest feeder countries to American colleges -- also said they were seeing postelection jitters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Andrew Chen, the chief development officer at WholeRen, an international education consulting company in Pittsburgh, returned to the United States this week from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, where, he said, colleges in other countries were trying to capitalize on fears over Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Many organizations and programs are starting to use this to promote education in the U.K., Australia and Singapore,'' Mr. Chen said. ''These competitors paint the U.S. as not safe. Now, with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, they're saying it's going to be unfriendly.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Chen said he believed the fears of international students were unfounded. ''He doesn't like refugees from the Middle East, and he said for all Muslims he wanted to do a background check,'' Mr. Chen said. ''And also people from Mexico. He doesn't like those people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Chen added, ''But I don't think he ever said he doesn't like international students who pay tuition to study in the U.S.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Rahul Choudaha, an international education consultant in New Jersey, has been traveling for the past week in India, where he said there was a palpable worry among students and their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They are not seeing the United States as a safe destination,'' said Mr. Choudaha, a founder of interEdge, a company that helps international students. ''They're changing the destination to Australia or Singapore.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's an anti-immigrant tone,'' he added. ''Just stylistically, he seems to be a very different person than people thought would be taking leadership in America.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As she prepared her applications to prestigious American universities, Naina Lavakare, a senior at the British School in New Delhi, developed a Plan B.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It was a family joke,'' said Ms. Lavakare's mother, Jyoti Pande. ''You can apply anywhere you want. However, if it's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the White House, we're not sure we want to send you to the U.S.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Lavakare, 17, has adjusted her college aspirations. While she still has several American colleges on her list -- in New York, California and Rhode Island -- she dropped universities in ''red states'' to focus on colleges in Britain and Canada, her mother said, because she was concerned about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> anti-immigrant talk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Lavakare and her friends, Ms. Pande said, ''view </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a bigot and a misogynist.'' She added, ''I think that is what is freaking them out more than anything else.''</SPAN></P>
