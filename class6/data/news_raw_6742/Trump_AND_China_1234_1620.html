</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> disparaged the American spy agencies that he will count on as commander in chief, dismissing a C.I.A. assessment that Russian hacking had influenced the presidential campaign as &quot;ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also questioned whether the U.S. mustremain bound to its longstanding One </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> policy &quot;unless we make a deal with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> having to do with other things, including trade.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is expected to name Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state. Mr. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, has made extensive deals around the globe and has close ties to Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turks gathered in mourning after twin suicide bombings in Istanbul killed 38 people and wounded scores. The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, a Kurdish militant group, claimed responsibility for the attack, the latest in a series that have crushed the city's spirit and economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the new norm,&quot; one resident said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey's clampdown on Kurds has been so thoroughgoing that it has left those who remain free expecting arrest at any moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Syrians are streaming out of eastern Aleppo as government forces hammer rebel-held neighborhoods with airstrikes, but some are staying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are dead either way,&quot; one man told a nurse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Islamic State appeared to take advantage of the government's focus on Aleppo, retaking the ancient city of Palmyra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our Europe editor followed Nanue Matabor, above, a Bangladeshi migrant - and the civil servant who decided his fate - through Italy's overwhelmed asylum system. Here's what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Op-Ed columnist Roger Cohen got into one ofAustralia's island detention centers for refugees. The world, he writes, &quot;knows no more sustained, sinister or surreal exercise in cruelty than the South Pacific quasi-prisons Australia has established for its trickle of the migrant flood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wall Street has become the biggest new landlord in Europe, as American financial firms bought nearly 80 percent of troubled real estate loans around the Continent over the last four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evictions and dubious tax strategies have turned the new buyers into a target of frustration and anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An investigation into the return of the Twinkie, a popular American sponge cake snack, sheds light on how private equity executives have amassed some of the greatest fortunes of the modern era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Top soccer clubs are hiring computer gamers, as teams seek to tap into a roughly $1 billion marketplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Iran's national airline and Boeing signed a $16.6 billion deal for 80 airplanes, but its future under a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration is uncertain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oil prices rose after OPEC's deal with nonmember producers to cut output.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank has all but announced it will raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the first time since December 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A K.G.B. dirty trick known as kompromat, the fabrication of compromising or illegal material, may have returned in a particularly noxious form: child pornography. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> European diplomats and military officers are debating alternatives to a U.S. deterrent against possible Russian aggression. [Der Spiegel]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Italy, Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni is trying to form a new government. He could face a confidence vote before Parliament as early as tomorrow. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Macedonia, the governing party and its largest opposition party both declared victory in parliamentary elections. [New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Romanian voters appeared to return the center-left Social Democratic Party to power. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regular trains started running through Switzerland's Gotthard Base Tunnel, the world's longest railway tunnel, reducing travel time for crossing the Alps by 30 minutes. [The Associated Press]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A lawyer for Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is expected to try to delay her criminal trial today on charges of fiscal negligence. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The alt-right movement in the United States is trying to improve its image, but its core message of racial separation and white supremacy is still the same. [The New York Times]</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Skam,&quot; an emotionally intense, true-to-life Norwegian web and television series about a group of teenagers, is bound for the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In March, a retired doctor visited a Paris auction house with a portfolio of drawings. Among them was a work now attributed to Leonardo da Vinci and valued at 15 million euros, about $15.8 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Headphones have become the ultimate escape in these disaffected times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In case you missed it: Here's Bob Dylan's Nobel Prize acceptance speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the so-called Pizzagate case escalated when a man fired a rifle inside a Washington restaurant falsely accused in fake news stories of ties to a child abuse ring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The history of the &quot;-gate&quot; suffix begins with the 1970s Watergate scandal that led to President Richard M. Nixon's resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, the suffix has been synonymous with political wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times columnist William Safire, a former Nixon speechwriter, popularized the practice. He introduced readers to Nannygate, Scalpgate, and Troopergate during the Clinton administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Safire later admitted that he might have been trying to minimize Nixon's crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;-gate&quot; scandals have not been limited to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain has had its share, and in Germany, there was the 1987 Waterkantgate, a scandal around a West German politician that resulted in his mysterious death. India had snoopgate, and Malaysia had cowgate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Argentina and Venezuela's relations soured over Valijagate - which, if you speak Spanish, you'd have guessed turned on the contents of a suitcase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unoriginal suffix even gets recycled now. Pizzagate was previously used to describe a soccer player's use of the food as a weapon, and when New York's mayor committed a no-no: using silverware to eata slice.</SPAN></P>
