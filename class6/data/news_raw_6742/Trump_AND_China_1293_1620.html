</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Here's what you need to know to start your day.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here's what you need to know:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kerry's speech rankles Israeli leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reactions to Secretary of State John Kerry's rebuke of Israel for settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem continue to pour in after his speech Wednesday, which featured a harshness rarely used by American diplomats in discussing a close ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Israelis do not need to be lectured about the importance of peace by foreign leaders,&quot; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded. Leaders from both sides of the settlement debate said Mr. Kerry had delivered a &quot;eulogy&quot; for a two-state solution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The address received criticismfrom U.S. lawmakers from both parties, and it was rejected by President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> even before it was delivered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Truce announced for Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government, along with Russia and Turkey, said today that they had reached a cease-fire agreement with the rebels, a potential turning point in the nearly six-year civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not immediately clear which of the scores of rebel groups scattered across Syria had agreed to the deal, which does not include Islamic State fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A new normal in Chicago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 750 people have been killed in the city this year, the police say, the highest total since 1997. Residents, primarily in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods on the South and West Sides, fear that shootings have become a routine part of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should be embarrassed as a city,&quot; one activist said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence has made walking to and from school treacherous for many children. The city's Safe Passage program hopes to change that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inside Apple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our investigation into the world's biggest iPhone factory, in Zhengzhou, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, revealed a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies. The operation shows how </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not only provides a large pool of labor but also offers incentives that would be difficult to replicate in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also look at why an iPhone costs less in American stores than in Chinese shops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A long-shot appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among our most popular articles this week is the case of Sam Siatta, a Marine Corps veteran of the war in Afghanistan who landed in prison after returning to Illinois.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was so drunk at the time of the violent act that led to his conviction that he doesn't remember it. Our reporter, who also served in the Marines, visited Mr. Siatta in prison and spent time with him in the months since his release this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health roundup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's essentially the serial killer of drugs.&quot; That's an addiction counselor's take on Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that can be 100 times more potent than morphine and that now causes more deaths in some parts of the U.S. than heroin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new study found that women who took fish oil in the last trimester of pregnancy significantly lowered the risk that their children developed asthma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, scientists are reassessing the possibilities of aging and performance thanks, in part, to an 85-year-oldwho recently finished a marathon in under four hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cable news channels looked as if they were fading two years ago. But 2016 proved to be a banner year for the networks, largely because of the presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The numbers weren't as good, though, for cable TV giants like Discovery, ESPN and TBS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chief executive of a Japanese ad agency is resigning to take responsibility forthe suicide of a young employee last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was working more than 100 hours of overtime a month, according to an inquiry, much of it unreported and unpaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Insomnia and other sleep disorders are said to affect 50 million to 70 million Americans, causing a litany of health problems as well as billions of dollars in lost productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology companies are developing alternativestosleeping pills, which can be addictive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. stocks were down on Wednesday. Here's a snapshot of global markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noteworthy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In memoriam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debbie Reynolds, the Hollywood star known for the 1952 musical &quot;Singin' in the Rain,&quot; died at 84, a day after the death of her daughter, the actress Carrie Fisher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's now with Carrie and we're all heartbroken,&quot; her son said. Here's a look at six movies for which Ms. Reynolds will be remembered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Revisiting an atrocity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 100 years after a genocide of the Herero people in Namibia, Germany is acknowledging its role. In our latest 360 video, a Herero elder recounts a story he heard from his forefathers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Backlash after beach bash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City Council of a Sydney suburb banned alcohol on the beach for the rest of the summer after more than 10,000 people trashed Coogee Beach onChristmas Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revelers were so drunk that oxygen tanks were needed to resuscitate some partygoers and that a shark alarm was set off three times to get intoxicated swimmers out of the water, according to an official. They also left behind 16 tons of garbage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recipe of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Couscous doesn't have to be boring. Jazz it up with saut&eacute;ed cherry tomatoes and basil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case you missed it, a bit of music history was made this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen&quot; song by the Japanese comedian Kazuhito Kosaka went from YouTube to a spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. At 45 seconds, it's the shortest song to ever appear on the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the video has been watched more than 104 million times since its release this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lyrics, while not likely to win the artist a Nobel Prize in Literature, proved to be catchy: &quot;I have a pen, I have a apple. Uh! Apple pen!&quot; Many imitations have appeared online over the last months, including one by late-night host Stephen Colbert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what his favorite version was, Mr. Kosaka, who is better known by his stage name Pikotaro, said it was one from India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there is one thing I need to say: There is someone who in one of the videos actually stabs an apple with a pen,&quot; he said. &quot;That's a waste.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kosaka is relishing his newfound popularity, but he's wary of becoming a one-hit wonder. He's working on new music, but this time about citrus fruits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Boehler contributed reporting.</SPAN></P>
