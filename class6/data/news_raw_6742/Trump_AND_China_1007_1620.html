</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clout of the ''Davos Man'' may be in question with the victories of Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and the Brexit campaign, but the world's leaders and thinkers are rolling into the snowy resort of Davos, Switzerland, all the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the World Economic Forum is trying to acknowledge what may have been a failing on the part of attendees at its annual meeting to articulate the benefits of open trade. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  So the event's organizers have put together an index of what they call inclusive growth and development, measuring countries according to their progress on economic growth and reducing income inequality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's our response to how capitalism has failed us -- and how we need to fix it,'' said Adrian Monck, a member of the forum's executive committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The question is whether discussions this year can go beyond the theoretical for a group that many middle-class voters view as out of touch with real economic challenges, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Russian Forays</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I have no dealings with Russia,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said at his news conference last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Well, it wasn't for lack of trying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In spite of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> insistence that he has ''stayed away'' from Russia in his corporate dealings, he has repeatedly sought business in Russia, from as far back as 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> applied for his trademark in the country as early as 1996 and his children and associates have visited Moscow in search of joint ventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In 2013, the president-elect sold Russian real estate developers the right to host his Miss Universe pageant and used the visit as a chance to discuss development deals. ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">TRUMP</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TOWER-MOSCOW is next,'' he wrote on Twitter at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his partners pursued Russians newly flush with cash as the country's market opened up in the post-Soviet era. And seeking deals in Russia became part of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> brand's expansion efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the long run, however, it proved more challenging in Russia than it did in places like India and the Philippines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Women in Governance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Corporate governance is rare in the finance world. Could that be because it's an area where women dominate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They hold the top positions in corporate governance at many of the biggest mutual funds and pension funds, deciding which way to vote on the directors of a company board, making decisions for teachers, government employees, doctors and most people with a 401(k).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Women are the heads of corporate governance at seven of the 10 largest institutional investors in stocks. These investors oversee $14 trillion in assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Corporate governance is playing a growing role in corporate America, but the power wielded by these institutions is rarely used to confront companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, the heads of corporate governance at institutional giants say they are working quietly behind the scenes to press for greater shareholder rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Coming Up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   President Xi Jinping of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> who is at Davos for the first time, will deliver a speech at 5 a.m. E.T.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Theresa May, Britain's prime minister, is set to make a long-awaited speech on her plans for leaving the European Union. She is likely to opt for a so-called hard Brexit, exiting Europe's single market and its customs union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Morgan Stanley, which has gravitated toward more stable businesses like wealth management in recent years, reports its quarterly earnings. Investors will be looking to see whether it has benefited from this strategy.</SPAN></P>
