<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">HIGHLIGHT:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;There is method to his madness. The president-elect redefines the past, present and future to suit his agenda.<BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Election Day there has been an abundance of liberal hyperbole about the dangers of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Kinsley wrote in the Washington Post that &quot;Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is Actually a Fascist.&quot; Jonathan Chait warned in New York magazine of &quot;the step-by-step acceptance of the unthinkable as normal.&quot; Masha Gessen, a Russian journalist known for her opposition to Vladimir Putin who is also a colleague, primed Americans on what to expect from a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration in an essay in The New York Review of Books: &quot;Autocracy: Rules for Survival.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some on the right dismiss these arguments as over the top - &quot;articles about the Left's freakout over Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are getting a little stale,&quot; Jonah Goldberg wrote on National Review's website - and it's possible that Kinsley, Chait and Gessen will be proven wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, however, a good chance that they are dead right.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> proved throughout his campaign and in the month since he won that he would not only lie repeatedly, but that he could get away with it. As Glenn Kessler, who writes the Fact Checker column for The Washington Post, pointed out on Nov. 4:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has amassed such a collection of Four-Pinocchio ratings - 59 in all - that by himself he's earned as many in this campaign as all other Republicans (or Democrats) combined in the past three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 59 totally false &quot;whoppers,&quot; in the Kessler rating system, compare to seven awarded to Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> success in winning the presidency despite a modern day record of lying suggests that for the moment he has been empowered by a large segment of the electorate to redefine the past, present and future to suit his agenda. He has been unconstrained by facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We don't yet know if </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will take full advantage of this free pass or how much leeway Congress, the courts and the public will grant him. But once established, this command over reality has an appeal that is difficult, if not impossible, to let go. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has shown no signs of doing so. Indeed, he brings to mind George Orwell's observation that totalitarianism demands</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the continuous alteration of the past, and in the long run probably demands a disbelief in the very existence of objective truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, in a notorious tweet on Nov. 27, asserted that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appearing Dec. 11 onFox News Sunday, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, despite losing the popular vote by 2.84 million, continued to describe his win as &quot;one of the great victories of all time,&quot; arguing that Democrats &quot;suffered one of the greatest defeats in the history of politics in this country&quot; and that &quot;we had a massive landslide victory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> adamant rejection of the C.I.A.'s finding that Russia intervened in the election in order to help him has become the focus of partisan warfare putting </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in conflict not only with Democratic congressional adversaries, but with Republican critics like Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Dec. 9 the Washington Post published a story on the C.I.A.'s assessment that American intelligence agencies had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials. Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and hurt Clinton's chances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team quickly attacked the credibility of the C.I.A. in a prepared statement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It's now time to move on and &quot;Make America Great Again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The push back against </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was swift. Michael V. Hayden, director of the National Security Agency and later the C.I.A. under George W. Bush, told The Times:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To have the president-elect of the United States simply reject the fact-based narrative that the intelligence community puts together because it conflicts with his a priori assumptions - wow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ongoing conflict over the intelligence agency's analysis of Russian involvement has become the first major test of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> alt-reality vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John McCain, the Arizona Republican who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, flatly contradicted </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> last Sunday during an appearance on Face the Nation:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facts are stubborn things. They did hack into this campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Dec. 12, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, endorsed a formal inquiry into the allegations. In doing so, McConnell set the stage for a confrontation between the congressional and executive branches even before </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> takes office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is method to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> madness. Despite the nine lives he has demonstrated, he seems eager to avoid a damaging challenge to his legitimacy as the nation's chief executive, intent on defining his election as &quot;a massive landslide victory&quot; and &quot;one of the great victories of all time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Studies conducted before and during the election found that support for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> correlated with voters' desire for what they see as authoritative leadership. Marc Hetherington, a political scientist at Vanderbilt, described such voters as having what he calls a &quot;fixed worldview,&quot; as opposed to those with a &quot;fluid worldview.&quot; Hetherington notes that those with a fixed view score high on tests of authoritarianism and those with a more fluid view score low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an essay published in October in PS: Political Science and Politics, &quot;Authoritarian Voters and the Rise of Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">,&quot; Matthew C. MacWilliams, a teaching associate at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, found that &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rise is in part the result of authoritarian voters' response to his unvarnished, us-versus-them rhetoric&quot; and that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uniformity and order are authoritarian watch words. Authoritarians obey. They seek order. They follow authoritarian leaders. They eschew diversity, fear &quot;the other,&quot; act aggressively toward others, and, once they have identified friend from foe, hold tight to their decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on survey data collected in the course of this year's Republican primaries, MacWilliams found a strong relationship between support for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and voters' support for authoritarian values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The power and depth of this kind of support has freed </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> from the normal obligation to avoid making statements that are verifiably untrue. His loyalists are strongly inclined to believe what he says, and to forgive falsehoods that they see as harmless exaggerations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One thing that's been interesting this campaign season to watch is that people that say facts are facts - they're not really facts,&quot; Scottie Nell Hughes, a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporter, said on The Diane Rehm Show on Nov. 30. Her remarks caused a ruckus, but Hughes also laid bare </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> basic method, which got lost in the kerfuffle:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's no such thing, unfortunately anymore, as facts. And so Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> tweets, among a certain crowd - a large part of the population - are truth. When he says that millions of people illegally voted, he has some facts - among him and his supporters - and people believe they have facts to back that up. Those that do not like Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, they say that those are lies and there's no facts to back it up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or as Corey Lewandowski, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> former campaign manager and current adviser, puts it:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the problem with the media. You guys took everything that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said so literally. The American people didn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This willingness to suspend disbelief &quot;gives </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> not only license but incentive to spin fantasy, because no one expects him to tell the truth,&quot; Rob Stutzman, a Republican consultant who worked for Jeb Bush, told the Los Angeles Times. &quot;They believe they're getting lied to constantly, so if their hero tells lies in order to strike back, they don't care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ownership of this phenomenon is not the exclusive property of the right. Democrats, liberals and academics have made significant, if unknowing, contributions to the credulity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Nov. 15 essay &quot;Straight Talk on Trade,&quot; Dani Rodrik, an economist at Harvard, poses the question, &quot;Are economists partly responsible for Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> shocking victory in the US presidential election?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proponents of globalization, Rodrik argues, have in recent decades downplayed the costs of trade on the &quot;implicit premise&quot; that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there are barbarians on only one side of the trade debate. Apparently, those who complain about World Trade Organization rules or trade agreements are awful protectionists, while those who support them are always on the side of the angels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is that many in the economics profession</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have consistently minimized distributional concerns, even though it is now clear that the distributional impact of, say, the North American Free Trade Agreement or </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> entry into the World Trade Organization were significant for the most directly affected communities in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eduardo Porter, a Times colleague, raised the same basic issue in a column earlier this week, &quot;Where Were </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Votes? Where the Jobs Weren't.&quot; Porter wrote that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">less-educated white voters had a solid economic rationale for voting against the status quo - nearly all the gains from the economic recovery have passed them by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Nov. 7, 2007, according to Porter, Hispanics have gained nearly 5 million jobs, African-Americans and Asian-Americans have each gained over 2 million jobs, but whites have lost nearly 1 million jobs. Those job losses were heavily concentrated in those Rust Belt and, relatively speaking, more rural states where </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> racked up his Electoral College win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The credibility of the Democratic Party generally among </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> voters is at an all-time low, as Democratic candidates discovered on Nov. 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Democratic vulnerability was explored in depth by Katherine Cramer, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin, in a book on voters in that state, &quot;The Politics of Resentment,&quot; which came out in March. In her study, Cramer described the three elements of &quot;rural consciousness&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, a belief that rural areas are ignored by decision makers, including policy makers, second, a perception that rural areas do not get their fair share of resources, and third a sense that rural folks have fundamentally distinct values and lifestyles, which are misunderstood and disrespected by city folks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result, she argues, is the creation of a rural identity &quot;infused with a sense of distributive injustice,&quot; much of it focused on liberal policies directing tax dollars to urban racial minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These rural voters, and others in the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> coalition, are more than willing to give </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the benefit of the doubt. Their deep feeling that whatever else he was, he was on their side permitted him to shrug off criticism as emanating from malevolent political elites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> attempt to subvert truth is a major challenge to democratic governance. In this context, it may be wise to listen to the predictions of Masha Gessen. &quot;Despite losing the popular vote, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has secured as much power as any American leader in recent history,&quot; she writes in The New York Review of Books essay I mentioned earlier. &quot;He will want to maintain and increase it - his ideal is the totalitarian-level popularity numbers of Vladimir Putin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having watched in frustration as </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ran roughshod over the party establishment and all of its candidates, Republicans are actually more likely than Democrats to recognize the potential threat posed by the president-elect. Because of this - in the strange pathways of politics - the hearings on alleged Russian hacking will become not only an inquiry into cyber espionage, but also a forum for Republican leaders to put </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in his place and to set limits on his presidency.</SPAN></P>
