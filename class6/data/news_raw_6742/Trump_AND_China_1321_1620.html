<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good evening. Here's the latest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'll be off on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. See you Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The House joined the Senate in laying the groundwork for speedy action to repeal the Affordable Care Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President-elect Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> again attacked Hillary Clinton over her emails on Twitter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We took a look at the first cabinets of the past few presidents, and determined that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will be the least diverse since that of President Ronald Reagan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A Justice Department report found the Chicago police systematically violated the civil rights of residents, particularly African-Americans and Latinos, by using excessive force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report came in the wake of the city's highest murder rate in 20 years in 2016. In an effort to fix the problems, federal and city officials reached a preliminary agreement on changes to police practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Takata pleaded guilty to charges stemming from its handling of defective airbags, and will pay $1 billion in penalties. Three of its executives face criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airbags can rupture violently when they deploy. They have been linked to at least 11 deaths, which prompted the largest automotive recall in American history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Chelsea Manning is asking Mr. Obama to commute her sentence before he leaves office next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Manning, who was an Army intelligence analyst known as Bradley Manning when she disclosed archives of secret military and diplomatic files to WikiLeaks in 2010, is serving a 35-year sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is struggling to transition to life as a woman in a male prison, and attempted suicide twice last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">China</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has banned child abuse at its infamous digital detox boot camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are just a few of the camps, but they're known for harsh treatment, including beatings and electroshock therapy to get children offline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law also sets a daily limit on how long minors can play online games at home or in internet cafes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Thousands of members of the New York Police Department attended the funeral of Officer Steven McDonald, who was paralyzed in a 1986 shooting but became a symbol of forgiveness and hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officer McDonald had less than two years on the job when he was shot by a 15-year-old in Central Park. He publicly forgave his attacker and eventually traveled the globe, speaking of his Roman Catholic faith and the importance of compassion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He died on Tuesday at 59, several days after a heart attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The U.S. Mint will release a commemorative gold coin featuring Lady Liberty as a black woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's the first time that she's been depicted as anything other than white on the nation's currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coin will have a $100 face value and goes on sale April 6 to commemorate the 225th anniversary of the mint's coin production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. What's the right time to put your home on the market? Whenever you want.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A real estate article of faith once had it that mid- to late-February, the start of the so-called spring season, was the best time to list a property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now that everyone looks at listings online, realtors say the rules about timing have gone out the window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. If one of your vacation goals is inspiring envy in others, you may want to bookmark these tips on how to take great travel photos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make a list of key shots, shoot at sunrise and sunset and experiment with angles. And after all that planning, don't forget to be spontaneous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. Finally, we bring you the back story of the iconic image of Marilyn Monroe's white dress fluttering up as she stands over a subway grate in &quot;The Seven Year Itch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What made it into the movie was actually a reshoot of a discarded and more risqu&eacute; scene filmed on the Upper East Side in the summer of 1954.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discarded version happened to also be captured on 16-millimeter film by an amateur filmmaker who lived nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jules Schulback often talked about the footage, but no one saw it for 50 years, until he was 92 and his granddaughter found it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have a great weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">_____</SPAN></P>
