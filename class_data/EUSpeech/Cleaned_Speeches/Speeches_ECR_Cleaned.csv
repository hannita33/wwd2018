Nirj Deva MEP in Washigton D.C. : A Peace Treaty – The first step to peace on the Korean Peninsula,29-09-2015,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,2582,"<p>
	</p><p>Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I am truly delighted to be standing here before you all.</p><p>
</p><p>As we gather here, today, I am reminded that we are here to discuss the last battlefront of the twentieth century, dormant perhaps, but hardly dead. </p><p>
</p><p>Yet, I believe that we were brought here together today, because we share a common purpose; that after six decades and a war, reconciliation, redemption, and re-unification are not beyond hope; that the Korean Peninsula has an opportunity to rise above the failings of the past; and seize a collective future in which its security is more than some illusory promise but an eventual reality.</p><p>
</p><p>The example of the European Union, the example of East and West Germany, both come into mind. In the first example, after killing over 100 million people in Two World Wars, finally Europeans have come together recognising that they share a common culture, a common history and a common set of values bound by a contiguous geography. In the second example, a Germany unified by Bismarck over 100 years ago was reunified 25 years ago reversing the dislocation and division catalysed by different political systems allied in one case and enforced in the other by the two super powers after the second world war. Whereas the German example appears immediately more apposite to the issue of North and South Korea, in fact it is the example of the European Union, an embodiment of how to share power and trade together which may prove a better road map for the future of the Korean peninsula.</p><p>
</p><p>Recently the World has again, after an interregnum of 25 years, become a very dangerous place. </p><p>
</p><p>International terrorism, anarchy in the Middle East, NATO – Russian tension over the Ukraine, economic and market turbulence, a resurgent and powerful China legitimately ambitious to extend her global spheres of influence, and the continuing nuclear threats of North Korea have all compounded to the crucible of global tensions.</p><p>
</p><p>In my view the issue of North Koreas militarisation and nuclearisation has been a saga of missed opportunities that could have been put right; a long time ago; however with reference to the most recent rumour of a missile launch in October, I strongly urge the North Korean leadership at this very critical time to not escalate regional tensions. At a time when the Japanese peace constitution is being challenged whatever the scientific and technical reasons may be, this is not a good time.</p><p>
</p><p>I believe in that famous axiom articulated eloquently by Lord Palmerston who said, Britain does not have permanent allies or permanent enemies. She only has permanent interests. Peace negotiations or any negotiations for that matter underpinned by policies, which, by unwittingly setting preconditions or stipulations that goes on to sabotage itself and the long term interests of that country is a foolish policy. Diplomacy is not about egos or dignity. Its central purpose is the pursuit of the national interests by whatever means possible as long as those means are legal. If the long term national interests are thwarted because of negotiating pre conditions, then those conditions however legitimate, however sensible, however practical, are a Trojan horse achieving the very thing nobody wanted in the first place. The history of the Korean peninsula and the tensions created within it are littered with preconditions and such Trojan horses. We have now come, I believe to a point that nobody wanted. Not even dare I say the North Koreans.</p><p>
</p><p>The biggest of such Trojan horses in the long drawn out saga of the Korean peninsula were the events leading to North Korea leaving the Non Proliferation Treaty and going on to build a nuclear bomb; after 1994. It could have been avoided, with more skilful diplomacy; but the West played her hand very badly. Now we have the very thing we were determined to avoid. The discovery of hitherto unknown centrifuges in North Korea, whether revealed by design or accident, catalysed the destruction of the Agreed Frame Work of 1994 which had until then acted as somewhat of a brake on North Koreas nuclear development, which was being carried out clandestinely and very slowly. The end of the Agreed Frame Work left North Korea withdrawing from the Non Proliferation Treaty and openly accelerating her nuclear ambitions. How clever was that? How did it ever serve the U.S., South Korean and European Union long term interests ? Short answer is that it did not and the whole thing was an own goal.</p><p>
</p><p>But let us also not forget that the USA is not only a world power and the protector of democracy and the so called free world, she is also very dexterous at changing policy to suit her long term interests. Just ask the Saudi’s how they feel about the American Pact with Iran, a state of affairs which suddenly came about thanks wholly to the vigorous endeavours of the Chinese in promoting the Silk Road and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank particularly focussed on the development of Central and Western Asia, where for some 1500 years the Persian Empire played the role of bulwark against westward expansion by the Mongols and Imperial China.</p><p>
</p><p>Recently, President Obama, having woken up from a long stupor, has worked hard and commendably to attend to the running sores left behind by the Cold War. He recognised that leaving Cuba in limbo served no purpose and has started fixing that relationship. Likewise with Myanmar, which had been left out in the cold for 70 years. Most astonishing he has started to mend the jagged and febrile relationship the US had with Iran, which again like North Korea was allowed to fester under successive US Administrations, serving no purpose other than inadvertently strengthening the resolve and self-sufficiency of her adversary and becoming more and more extreme and resolutely resourceful.</p><p>
</p><p>US Admiral William Gortney announced that in his assessment North Korea is now capable of mounting a miniaturised nuclear warhead atop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the USA. </p><p>
</p><p>Additionally we have even seen in most recent weeks, the country publically glorifying the re-opening of its Yongbyon nuclear reactor, the largest one it has, now back in full operation. How has the World and more particularly the USA, EU and others allowed this to happen? Clearly sanctions haven’t worked. To me this is a resounding failure of our diplomacy, hand wringing at the side lines, in interminable conferences, rebuking the North Koreans for being untrustworthy while not finding a mechanism for making progress and bringing them into the fold of the international community.</p><p>
</p><p>Such a transition, if enacted peacefully, would serve to alleviate the primary source of instability in North East Asia; which if mishandled through misfeasance could lead to a dangerous global crisis.</p><p>
For an impoverished North, reconciliation would mark a future of re-engagement with the international community, ending economic sanctions in favour of an influx of trade and development.</p><p>
</p><p>For Seoul, it would offer a unique prospect; to scale back military conscription, currently standing at 680,000-men, and reduce the necessarily exorbitant defence spending, presently marked at $30 billion a year; a figure which excludes the $1 billion a year sent to Washington, to help cover the costs of a ‘permanent’ U.S. military’s presence on the Peninsula.</p><p>
</p><p>Whilst admittedly, this line of thinking is fraught with ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’, however any process which would result in the securement of North Korean nuclear weapons and the peaceful demobilisation of its dauntingly sizeable army, would leave Seoul, Washington and Tokyo markedly more secure.</p><p>
</p><p>Even China, a rising economic powerhouse in its own right, would benefit from converting its efforts from supporting the Kim administration, predominantly through transfers of fuel and food, to increasing its capital investments in the country; a driving force behind the national development process.</p><p>
</p><p>Whilst regional stability rightly remains the fundamental aspiration, long term benefits are considerable. The reunification of the Korean Peninsula is forecast to foster what has been referred to in recent years by President Park as an “economic bonanza”. The combined population of a 75 million person economy would be expected to compete with that of France, Germany, and Japan, creating the eighth-largest economy in the world.</p><p>
</p><p>The North’s vast potential for growth, massive mineral deposits and youth-orientated population would serve to ideally offset the slowing population growth of South Korea and its limited natural resources. South Korea’s high-tech electronics sector and booming industry, coupled with a young, educated and eager labour force from the North could generate meteoric economic gains that would ensure prosperity for all Koreans, regardless of region or ideology.</p><p>
</p><p>Today in the North, 91 percent of the population is younger than 65 and the fertility rate stands at 2.0 children per women. A reunified or confederated Korean Peninsular would add more than 17 million potential lower waged lower skilled workers, aged 15 to 64, to the nearly 36 million workers already in the South. The prospect of a dynamic, young work force is especially enticing given the rapid ageing of the South Korean population, where life expectancy has reached 81 years and continues to improve and the birth rate stands at only 1.2 children per woman and is among the lowest in the world.</p><p>
</p><p>However, reunification is an issue that will not prove simple and is made all the more complex for the dividing methodology and goals exhibited in its pursuit, by both North and South where on paper at least, both sides of the Korean Peninsula are firmly committed to the express principle of national unification but both envisage this process in very different ways.</p><p>
</p><p>The South envisages this process as a policy of “trust building,” driven by a three phase plan: Firstly, a phase of reconciliation and cooperation between the two countries on joint activities and initiatives: Secondly, the creation of a trade based Korean Commonwealth: And finally, geographic reunification with the attainment of a Korean single state.</p><p>
</p><p>The North, on the other hand, has expressed its eagerness to create a Korean Federation; possessed of two distinct ideological social systems which would be expected to co-exist and promote mutual prosperity.</p><p>
It is perhaps unsurprising that the North and South have such wildly divergent aspirations. South Korea is democratic, Capitalist, a technological juggernaut and Asia’s fourth largest economy. North Korea, on the other hand, is authoritarian, Communist and internationally isolated with an economy a third of the size of Ethiopia’s.</p><p>
</p><p>As such, I am wary of reports like the recent release by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Korea National Diplomatic Academy, which claims that unification will be attained by 2040-2050. It is not the timeline that proves troubling, but the idea that there is some silver bullet, a hidden ace up the sleeve which will solve all our problems; in this case, concentrating on a joint economic system that would see would see North Korea’s national average income, per capita, rise to $10,000. It currently stands at $1800, per capita.</p><p>
</p><p>Gyeong-seob of South Korea’s Sejong Institute, put it most succinctly when, commenting on both this report and President Park’s reunification policy, stated that “it was a blueprint for the most splendid building imaginable, but did not demonstrate the ability to construct it.” Lofty ideals may be well and good but as I may have mentioned before, the devil lies in the details.</p><p>
</p><p>We must ask whether South Korea actually wants to contemplate absorbing 25 million new citizens alongside paying for the process which has been estimated to cost $500 billion dollars over the next twenty years, despite the fact that a resurgent, unified Korea would prove a major regional power. Yet, democratic South Korea has 80% of the population broadly in support of reunification and, if the outpouring of popular elation that gripped Germany in 1989 is any indication, it would appear unlikely to pose as an issue of contention.</p><p>
</p><p>Further examination, however, indicates a certain softness to these comforting polling figures. A recent survey, in March, reported that that 22% of South Koreans in their 20′s would prefer to maintain separate states, higher than any other age group. Generations have been born where division has been the status quo. It is a trend that will only be exacerbated by more time separated. Indeed, only 14% said they felt North Koreans were “one of us.”</p><p>
</p><p>Yet what truly worries me is not the undeniable social complexity inherent to the issue, nor the prevalent and persistent challenges that naturally hound any idea of reconciliation; of peace. I am astounded that after six decades, after the cold war is long dead and buried, that neither side have drawn up a peace treaty. I am astounded that what holds the fragile balance of this Peninsula is an armistice agreement signed in 1953. To be clear that is an armistice agreement – a temporary cessation of hostilities – a pause as both sides catch their breath and re-arm for the fight. An armistice agreement that, I feel compelled to add, South Korea has never signed. Yet, both sides audaciously talk of reunification; express their desire to heal, to put past grievances behind them. How can we speak of reunification when we do not even have peace treaty?</p><p>
</p><p>In the politics of warfare, conflict comes to an end when one side loses or an armistice is signed, by both sides! After it is signed there is usually a natural desire for a peace treaty. The peace treaty then leads to settlement, reparations, even reunification. These are the normal steps of human endeavour that have ended conflicts in every last corner of the world for thousands of years. Why is this process not being applied in the Korean peninsula?</p><p>
</p><p>It has been over sixty years; years in which whole economies, societies and foreign policies have been built upon an armistice; on what?; on trust?; on mutual self-belief that war will not begin again?</p><p>
63 years later, it beggars belief that successive leaders from both North and South Korea have utterly irresponsibly circumvented the fundamental need to give a more permanent security to their people. Successive leaders have agreed to go on with life, carrying on with their economic and social expansions upon an armistice; an agreement so insecure, so unstable and so irresponsibly based on the expectation that the USA and her taxpayer will stand guarantee for ever till the end of time securing the peace of South Korea. This is wholly based on the premise that the USA have permanent friends, not permanent interests. Even a cursory examination of US foreign policy today, regarding Israel, the Palestine, Iran, et al will show how wrong this can be. Instead we should seize this chance, at a time when the USA is re-evaluating her global strategy and making new alliances, to use this greater flexibility to give greater security to the South Korean people and by default for the people of North Korea.</p><p>
</p><p>And, despite the numerous challenges, particularly to South Korea in terms of simple cost, a united Peninsula will find avenues of commerce to China; to Russia and all through Asia to Europe. It will cost money, but it is an investment in the future; in Korea’s future. Not for us here, today, but for the generations to come, it will mean stability, security, peace.</p><p>
</p><p>Yet, all this is a pipe dream. Reunification is unlikely to prove spontaneously organic. It needs a platform. It needs peace – in this case a peace treaty. There is no way around it, and this is where we must begin. The road forward will likely prove obstinate to say the least, but to put it plainly: “No peace treaty, no bonanza.”</p><p>

"Speech on lessons to learn from the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War – Martin Callanan, Strasbourg, 16th April 2014",16-04-2014,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,777,"<p>
	</p><p>Mr President, it is perhaps appropriate that what may be the last contributions of Presidents Daul, Swoboda and Cohn-Bendit should be in a solemn debate to reflect on the past. Whilst we have many political differences which we no doubt will continue to argue about on future occasions in other forums, I would like to put these to one side today, to express my respect for their work and contribution to public life in this Chamber</p><p>
</p><p>Politicians are all too easily and frequently criticised, but I believe that there is nothing more noble or honourable than devoting a life to public service and seeking to create a better world through robust democratic argument and debate about ideals sincerely held. I would therefore like to pay tribute to them today. </p><p>
</p><p>The First World War was, in the words of Fritz Stern, “the first calamity of the 20th century, the calamity from which all other calamities sprang.”</p><p>
</p><p>The sheer cost in terms of human sacrifice means we should be obliged to remember in our private thoughts and our public words  all those who gave up so much in that struggle: their lives, their health, their families, their property, their way of life.  </p><p>
</p><p>The First World War may not have been the first industrial war, nor was it the first global war, or even the first civilian war but it was all of these things on a previously unimaginable scale. Its impact and reach were of a new magnitude: in looking at the numbers of dead, the casualty rates, the 54,000 soldiers remembered at the Menin Gate in Ypres whose bodies were never found, –  it is hard to comprehend the full impact of the war. </p><p>
</p><p>But behind all the numbers are the human stories. Each of the 54,000 had a mother, a father, many of them a wife, and many of them children. The First World War touched farming families in India and factory workers in Australia.The First World War shaped the modern world and in many aspects we are still living in its shadow. </p><p>
</p><p>But even now it is possible some countries still refuse to learn the lessons. They try to get what they want by force, by threats, by creating a false sense of grievance to whip up domestic opinion and to provide a pretext for military action. Tactics we had hoped never to see again deployed in our continent are being used right now just beyond the frontiers of some of our member states.</p><p>
</p><p>In 1914 it was not clear what the democratic world  wanted, what it would accept, what it expected of others, and what it was prepared to do to defend these ideals. These are mistakes we must not repeat again.</p><p>
</p><p>But as we reflect on the horror of the First World War, we can also take inspiration from some of the individuals who in tragic circumstances pointed to a better world.</p><p>
</p><p>I think of people like Edith Cavell, the nurse who helped soldiers on all sides and was eventually executed for helping a group of Allied soldiers to escape. She became an inspiration for women’s rights.  </p><p>
</p><p>And I think of the first Black soldier to command white soldiers in the British Army – a man called Walter Tull – an action that what would seem normal to us today which was revolutionary in its day and helped take some of the first tentative steps towards a new era of equality. </p><p>
</p><p>Walter Tull is a particular hero of mine as he was a professional footballer – albeit for Tottenham Hotspur – as he was only the second black professional footballer in the English league. And it reminds me of the famous story of the 1914 Christmas day truce that perhaps best sums up how humanity can shine through even in the darkest days. Ordinary people putting differences aside and meeting on the football pitch instead – history does not recall, Mr President, who won that match, but I’m sure that Germany once again won on penalties. </p><p>
</p><p>So, as we head into an election campaign where all of us will be straining to highlight every difference and to demonstrate our divisions, events like this actually serve as a useful reminder to all of us that what unites us far outweighs what divides us.</p><p>
</p><p>And, since the chain of events that began in Sarajevo a hundred years ago, we have learnt that when we have differences, we can find peaceful ways of resolving them. It is one of the greatest achievements of western civilisation that must never be taken for granted. It is the legacy of all those who suffered during the twentieth century and it is the legacy we honour here today.</p><p>

Kirkhope on the role the US should play in the intelligence community to counter terrorism.,27-03-2014,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,1604,"<p>
	</p><p>In the last five years I have spent what seems to be almost every day in the European Parliament negotiating issues related to security, and in the European Parliament this is just about the “hottest potato” you can be handed. </p><p>The last 12 months especially have seen an intense political divide in the Parliament on these issues. The Parliament’s “investigation into mass surveillance” has been a severe test of ideologies, and has highlighted the vastly different histories of the Nations represented. I must remind you it was not such a distant memory for so many of my colleagues in Central and Eastern Europe for their phones to be tapped, and for secret police to raid their homes in the middle of the night; but to me, a Briton, intelligence is something that had protected me, my family, and our Nation, and helped us defeat oppression and extremism in recent history.</p><p>
</p><p>What is clear is that there is  no united voice in the European Union on this issue, but there are strong reactions on both sides:  </p><p>
</p><p>Some politicians thought that one solution was not actually to scale back the general use of intelligence and surveillance, but that it would be far more reassuring to Citizens if the European Union itself created a new super intelligence service. I do not agree!</p><p>
</p><p>Then there were those that wanted to herald Edward Snowden as the greatest advocate of democracy since Lincoln. It is looking increasingly unlikely that he will be able to collect a Nobel peace prize in that bastion of freedom known as “Vladimir Putin’s Russia”</p><p>
</p><p>There were some Politicians from my own country who seized upon the opportunity to score political points by pointing the finger and saying how outrageous all our anti-terror laws were, whilst not seeing the irony that it was their political party that had created and contributed to these laws.</p><p>
</p><p>There were those that  shouted out calling the United States the enemy, and demanding that all the important cross-Atlantic anti-terror agreements be suspended immediately with PNR (Passenger Name Records), Safe Harbour, and SWIFT banking security affected and that trade negotiations (TTIP) must be stopped. </p><p>
</p><p>I found myself accused of holding the most extreme view of the lot.</p><p>
</p><p>I actually held, as I still do, the controversial view of believing that more could be achieved by wielding more diplomacy between friends rather than through an irrational and disproportional show of strength. </p><p>
</p><p>America is the EU’s closest ally and now is not the time to retreat but to find a way forward together, based on shared values and trust, and a common aim to fight the global threat of terror. </p><p>
</p><p>There is no need to put aside beliefs, but there is a need to put aside differences. Our two sides must talk in a frank and open way, with the aim of compromise in mind which still secures Liberty and Democracy.</p><p>
</p><p>I state clearly that I believe that surveillance and intelligence gathering is necessary to protect us from the ever increasing threat which we face; and that continued EU – US cooperation in this field is not only vital but to be encouraged. I regard Edward Snowden as nothing more than a traitor and a wanted felon who must be held accountable in a free court of law, and I also firmly believe that our core beliefs of freedom and liberty should never be sacrificed in order to defeat our enemy. </p><p>
</p><p>But it would be naive to believe that in protecting citizens there is not a necessary loss of some privacy. Our job as legislators is to make sure that that loss is proportionate and justifiable. </p><p>
</p><p>9/11,   7/7 in London,   Madrid and Bali were tragic events and we are certainly not free of the threat of more, and in a perfect world there would be no need for surveillance. But in a world where literally thousands of security threats are prevented and detected every year, surveillance is a necessary tool in a fast moving, technologically sophisticated and dangerous world. And the role and value of the US in the intelligence community is unrivalled. Our opponents and terrorists use these new technologies – we must too!</p><p>
</p><p>We live in a world with high stakes;  a world of dirty bombs, nuclear weapons, biological diseases, and ever more innovative ways of killing and menacing our populations.</p><p>
</p><p>But, there are those that believe privacy is a right which supercedes all others that must always be untouched, whatever the consequences. However,there is also a large majority who demand responsibility and safety. Telling the victims of terrorism and telling a country that they have liberty and freedom is inappropriate in the aftermath of a terrorist attack. </p><p>
</p><p>Individuals demand to know why things were missed, why they weren’t protected, why people had to die, and why we were unable to deliver quick and effective justice to  perpetrators. </p><p>
</p><p>After the Brighton bombings which nearly cost the life of Margaret Thatcher, the IRA famously said, “Remember we only have to be lucky once. You will have to be lucky always.”</p><p>
</p><p>The intelligence capabilities of the United States and the United Kingdom are not just a consequence of superior investment, but a consequence of necessity. America and the United Kingdom are not necessarily the countries which are most at threat on this unprecedented scale, but they’re the countries which rightly or wrongly are relied upon to keep the rest of the world safe. And in a world of tight budgets, defence cuts, and increasing threats, investment into counter-terrorism and surveillance is the area which we cannot afford to neglect.</p><p>
</p><p>We live in a world where individuals are not only prepared to kill others for what they believe in, but also themselves.That’s new!  The enemy no longer just comes from far away to kill us, it comes from home and from within our own society ; and until last summer all European leaders were talking about the necessity and the value of enhancing our ability to respond to terrorist threats through the active use of counter-surveillance and intelligence gathering and online surveillance, and the use of data will increasingly become a feature in a rapidly developing world. Internet chat rooms and the darkest corners of the internet are virtual meeting places where extreme attitudes are shared, strengthened and validated. The internet is also a place where tragedies are planned, financed and executed.</p><p>
So other countries have to become able to defend their infrastructure from acts of terrorism and also cybercrime, and not to be the weak link in a global chain.</p><p>
But the U.S. and the UK would not need such a monopoly on the intelligence community if other countries put more investment into building up a credible sector of detection, and a secure network which would enable us to better share information. Germany, for instance, has recently invested tens of millions of euros in expanding its own intelligence gathering system, and although this system has yet to go live, it is an indication that other countries see a need for increasing counter intelligence rather than scaling it back.</p><p>
But now it is likely that this investment by other countries will slow in light of recent public opinion and media criticism. Low level whistle-blowers, journalists and editors lacking in all expertise in this field have drawn conclusions from information they do not understand, and have presented it to the public in a way which can not appreciate its context or collection; this is something I believe to be beyond irresponsible. What is absent from the finger pointing and the rhetoric from critics of the intelligence community, is a discussion about existing oversight, independence, and accountability of the intelligence community. The sensitive nature of the information used in the oversight process often makes accountability almost invisible, even if it is ever-present. Any requests by GCHQ for access to British citizens’ emails would need proper legal authority, potentially including the personal approval of a minister or even Prime Minister. Whilst the UK and the US  have the most sophisticated and wide-reaching systems of surveillance, they are also undoubtedly the two countries with the most effective and extensive systems of independent oversight in the world.</p><p>
So, in all this, it is unfortunate that many Members of the European Parliament and other critics have not given more attention to the  important work that has already been done by the Congressional Intelligence Committee. Perhaps the greatest indication that the United States placed liberty at the heart of its aims was that in the face of criticism, America did not just turn its back and cover its ears; it showed that it was capable of a radical self-evaluation with regard to its relationship with privacy and its own citizens in the modern world. </p><p>
</p><p>That is why I believe that the relationship between the EU and the US must continue to strengthen in the fight against terrorism and  because common ground and basic values are undoubtedly there if you look for them. </p><p>
</p><p>Both the U.S. and the EU will always face the same debates, privacy versus accountability, society versus cyberspace, personal responsibility versus government enforcement. </p><p>
</p><p>Our two systems may be different but our aims are the same, to reconcile the protection of our citizens and our territories, whilst preserving control of our personal information and our personal rights. We both have these tools and whilst one may be protected in a constitution, and one may be protected in a charter of Rights, those rights are actually there, written and preserved and guiding us in this vitalwork.</p><p>

Callanan: 7-year budget agreement shows you can reduce and reprioritise EU spending,19-11-2013,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,627,"<p>
	</p><p>Well, here we are nine months later. An awful lot of hot air expended. A lot of threats have been made that never materialised.</p><p>
</p><p>And at its core we still have the MFF deal that our national Governments negotiated in February.</p><p>
</p><p> My group has always said that the next seven year budget should achieve two key principles: firstly, to reduce it, and secondly, to reprioritise it away from headings that do not add economic value in a 21st century global economy.</p><p>
</p><p> This MFF is a small step in the right direction.</p><p>
</p><p> It did not go as far as we would have hoped. However, it shows that the costs of the EU can be reduced yet the value to taxpayers can be increased.</p><p>
</p><p> Today’s vote marks the culmination of a long process that began several years ago when this parliament began its drafting of the SURE committee report.</p><p>
</p><p> That committee then proposed a five percent budget increase. It wanted new Own Resources and taxes on anything from flying to sales to CO2. </p><p>
</p><p>And it called for the abolition of fully justified national rebates.</p><p>
</p><p>Thankfully almost the opposite has happened. Only in the area of Own Resources has the parliament achieved a minor concession which will see a gaggle of so-called independent wise men from the three institutions dreaming up a whole host of new ways to spend more taxpayers’ money on pet EU projects.</p><p>
</p><p>However, I am certainly not going to lose much sleep over this Group. Because the Treaty is clear that Own Resources remain within the Council’s power under unanimity and I think we all know it is just not going to happen. </p><p>
</p><p>Because new own resources would fundamentally change the relationship between the EU and national governments. Instead of being their servants, it would become their master, forcing them to raise revenue to spend on whatever new scheme takes this Chamber’s fancy.</p><p>
</p><p> Those who call for new Own Resources are the same people who consistently call for ‘More Europe’ as the answer to all our ills. As if throwing money at the problem will solve it. Instead, just as we need a better Europe, so we need better and more effective spending.</p><p>
</p><p> That is why we generally welcome the outcome of the negotiations on the various spending regulations. Many of these programmes will help to promote cross-border research, to plug the holes in the Single Market’s infrastructure, and support the newer Members of the Union.</p><p>
</p><p> However, these programmes are by their very nature multiannual, and they rely on certainty. The posturing we’ve seen from this parliament since February – but especially since the summer – will make it difficult for many to properly be up and running by </p><p>January 1st.</p><p>
</p><p>I do agree with this parliament on one important area however. The European Commission’s budgetary management has been appalling. We cannot and must not end up in a situation whereby we are regularly returning to national governments just like Oliver Twist asking for more.</p><p>
</p><p> And when overspends do occur, savings must be made from elsewhere to compensate. It is time we learnt to live within our means.</p><p>
</p><p>A satisfactory outcome in these negotiations does not dampen our demands for root and branch budgetary reform. </p><p>
</p><p> Overall, Mr President, this agreement represents a fair compromise between north, south, east, and west; between net contributors and net recipients. Nine months on and we are voting on an agreement that is fundamentally the same as it was in February. </p><p>
</p><p>This parliament has postured and strutted during this unedifying process but in reality we can be clear that the Council’s common sense has prevailed.</p><p>
</p><p> For us it serves as an illustration that it is possible to make the EU do less and do it better.</p><p>

Geoffrey Van Orden MEP: Outcome of the October 2013 EU summit,05-11-2013,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,547,"<p>
	</p><p>Presidents, my group welcomes the progress made by Council on deregulation, promoting trade, readiness to bring Eastern Partners closer, and completing the single market in digital services.</p><p>
</p><p>Separately, President Barroso now says that the EU should meddle less in matters which are properly the business of our national governments. I hope the commission as a whole at last gets the message. To date, I fear it has not. For the Berlaymont, it’s business as usual. Let’s take just one example – the Port Services Directive – it was rejected by this house in 2003 and 2007 – but there’s no let up. It’s back. Why has it been resurrected yet again? Perhaps Commissioner Kallas might be persuaded to think again.</p><p>
</p><p>Of course, the best way of cutting back unhelpful regulation would be to reduce the number of European directorates and bureaucrats – fewer officials and fewer pet projects means less red tape, more competitiveness and a reduced EU budget – a triple benefit. </p><p>
</p><p>Turning to trade, we welcome the progress made withCanadatowards a trade agreement – but we must not rest on our laurels. We are concerned by the lack of progress on a deal withIndia- why was this not discussed in Council? -  the window of action will be closed by elections next year both here and there. And there’s little time to deliver the US deal, even without irrelevant distractions. We mustn’t let these opportunities slip away.</p><p>
</p><p>On migration, the summit conclusions on Lampedusa emphasised the role of Frontex. This debate has so far talked about the problems of front-line states but it has failed to understand that over two thirds of asylum applications are made in just five Northern European states, including my own.</p><p>
</p><p>It is not a question of creating new forms of legal migration or merely sharing out the resultant problems, but prevention and tackling the challenge at source, with support for border security in North African states, and workable returns agreements with immediate application.</p><p>
</p><p>We need practical solutions here that meet the concerns of our citizens to put an end to mass uncontrolled immigration. Instead of the EU soft line which merely creates more problems.  </p><p>
</p><p>A word now on the current intelligence spat, and I wonder about the real basis for the mock outrage expressed by the Commission and others about the alleged activities of the NSA.</p><p>
</p><p>Have you read the recent comments of Vice President Reding? She apparently thinks, “What we need is the strengthening of Europe in the intelligence area, in order to ensure that we negotiate with equal terms with theUS. NSA needs a European counterweight – a European Intelligence Agency.”</p><p>
</p><p>Whatever next, Mr President?</p><p>
</p><p>So there wasn’t really any great principle at stake, only resentment by the European mandarins that theUShad capabilities whichBrusselsdidn’t!</p><p>
</p><p>Apart from the sheer hypocrisy it shows how out of touch the European Commission has become. It does not seem to understand that the age of accumulating more and more EU powers, extending Commission competences, is over.  The demand now is the reverse. The EU must do much less and do it better.</p><p>

Callanan at 2013 State of the Union debate,11-09-2013,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,594,"<p>
	</p><p>“Europe needs a new direction. And, that direction cannot be based on old ideas. Europe needs a new thinking.”</p><p>
</p><p>These are not my words Mr Barroso, they are your words, from the equivalent speech last year. The problem is that, yet again, you haven’t delivered on any of these big promises and grand rhetoric.</p><p>
</p><p>Your chance to deliver that new direction has passed. The question is whether your successor will be able to deliver the change the EU needs.</p><p>
</p><p>Next year, the commission will have a fresh leader, although I am not optimistic he or she will come with any fresh ideas.</p><p>
</p><p>Many of the applicants for this fine position are here today:</p><p>
</p><p>· Commissioner Reding, who is clearly running as the federalist candidate, producing more eye-grabbing babble every day.</p><p>
</p><p>· Commissioner Rehn could be delivering this speech – although if he did we’ll all be having a very late lunch!</p><p>
</p><p>· And if Commissioner Rehn does get the Liberal nomination then perhaps Guy Verhofstadt could challenge Martin Schulz for the socialist nomination? He’d feel more at home there.</p><p>
</p><p>In fact, I think I’m one of the few people here who doesn’t fancy your job President Barroso, I’m perfectly happy with the one I’ve got!</p><p>
</p><p>The problem is that none of these candidates represent new ideas. They represent vested interests. The people of the European District in Brussels not the people of Europe.</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p>
</p><p>Next May the choice won’t be about anonymous candidates. It will be about whether you want to merely shuffle the deck of cards, or throw out the old deck and start afresh.</p><p>
</p><p>The essential flaw of the EU is that it does not trust in the capacity of people and markets to overcome problems. Problems can only be solved by Europe. If someone falls off a ladder, we need a new directive. People cannot be trusted to decide their own working hours or even whether to take up e-cigarettes to mention a topical subject.</p><p>
</p><p>When EU lawyers say the Financial Transactions Tax is illegal, that doesn’t matter because nothing – even the law – should stand in the way of European integration.</p><p>
</p><p>We need a new eurorealist direction with different ideas. One that says that patriotism is healthy. To be proudly German or French or Polish is not necessarily to be anti-European. The concepts are not antagonistic. And to want a new direction for Europe is not anti-EU.</p><p>
</p><p>The real anti-Europeans are those whose idea of change in the EU only means moving faster in the old failed direction.</p><p>
</p><p>The real nationalists are those who force us to accept a European nation that actually in reality nobody wants.</p><p>
</p><p>And you know what? We have tried the interventionist, centralising, socialist approach.</p><p>
</p><p>It may have been appropriate for the 1950’s – today its well past its sell-by date! Let’s try something different. Let’s try a new approach:</p><p>
</p><p>· Of rediscovering the principle of freedom that we fashioned for the world;</p><p>
</p><p>· Of opening our markets and embracing enterprise;</p><p>
</p><p>· Of eliminating the many vested interests in the Union</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p>
</p><p>Next year’s election will offer an opportunity :</p><p>
</p><p>· not to advance European political parties and their candidates.</p><p>
</p><p>· But to give people a true choice.</p><p>
</p><p>· Not about who you want steering the tanker.</p><p>
</p><p>· But whether you want to change its direction.</p><p>
</p><p>Many of us want change. The people want change. Next May the people of Europe will be able to make a stand. They can say that they don’t just want a new President for the EU, they want a new direction for it.</p><p>

Martin Callanan on European Council on youth unemployment,02-07-2013,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,725,"<p>
	</p><p>We keep debating unemployment and poor growth. But what enduring steps are we taking to solve this crisis?We’re taking some. But not nearly enough.
</p><p>Why is that? Because too often vested interests are obstructing the reforms that we desperately need.</p><p>
</p><p>We fail to see that more laws, more initiatives, and more red tape harm businesses and stop people from working.</p><p>
</p><p>Sometimes, less is more.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me give you an example. This is from someone who works in a temporary work agency and deals with the Agency Workers Directive. I quote:</p><p>
</p><p>“In many cases drivers who are employed on a Pay as you Earn basis are actually being stopped from working after their 11th week as this is the point at which the regulations kick in.”</p><p>
</p><p>President, people are being stopped from working because of the laws we pass in Europe.</p><p>
</p><p>The commission’s own European Vacancy Monitor showed that after the Agency Workers Directive came into force vacancies at Randstad – France’s leading temp agency – fell by 20 percent in two months.</p><p>
</p><p>This is legislation brought in to protect workers. But actually it persecutes them.</p><p>
</p><p>If we are serious about solving this problem then here are two good places to start:</p><p>
</p><p>1 – scrap the laws that punish productivity and entrepreneurship;</p><p>
</p><p>And 2 – open up markets so that enterprise is rewarded and not penalised.</p><p>
</p><p>The best way to create more employment in Europe would be to create some unemployment in the European Commission.</p><p>
</p><p>Fewer officials dreaming up new rules and regulations.</p><p>
</p><p>Fewer pet projects.</p><p>
</p><p>Fewer vested interests standing in the way of structural reforms.</p><p>
</p><p>Mr President, the saying ‘less is more’ should apply to the EU.</p><p>
</p><p>That is why I fully support the Dutch government’s efforts to draw a line in the sand.</p><p>
</p><p>To say that here are competences that we believe are better exercised closer to the people.</p><p>
</p><p>That ‘ever closer union’ is not the answer to our problems.</p><p>
</p><p>I am sure that Mr Verhofstadt will also want to show support for this position put forward by one of his liberal governments?</p><p>
</p><p>The problem is that we in this parliament and officials in the commission are dominated by vested interests.</p><p>
</p><p>This parliament seeks to extend its powers at every opportunity.</p><p>
</p><p>Commission officials move their careers forward by formulating new ways to interfere in our lives.</p><p>
</p><p>Ever closer union has become synonymous with ever more meddling, regardless of whether it is the right thing to do for our economy or our people.</p><p>
</p><p>We will soon be perfectly harmonised and equal in Europe. Unfortunately we will have harmonised poverty and equalised unemployment.</p><p>
___</p><p>
There is an alternative. And that is to cut this red tape;</p><p>
</p><p>To redirect our efforts to opening up markets;</p><p>
</p><p>And to reward hard work.</p><p>
</p><p>To do so will not be easy. There will be protests from many lobby groups, unions, and others often funded by the EU. But by taking on these vested interests we will open the door to the economic reforms we must make.</p><p>
</p><p>That is why I would like to see President Barroso use the last few months of his term to take on the socialists who are preventing these reforms.</p><p>
</p><p>Infact, I have to admit that I am at bit of a loss today.</p><p>
</p><p>I usually stand here and reprimand President Barroso. </p><p>
</p><p>Or I denigrate the French socialist government.</p><p>
</p><p>But now they are doing such a good job attacking each other that I’m not sure they need me anymore!</p><p>
</p><p>But frankly, some of the comments made by French Ministers in recent weeks have underlined their utter desperation.</p><p>
___</p><p>
</p><p>President, we now know that it is possible to overcome vested interests. The long-term budget talks have shown that change is possible.</p><p>
</p><p>The siren voices continue to argue that reducing the EU budget will somehow damage the economy in Europe.</p><p>
</p><p>That is not true.</p><p>
</p><p>It will harm those dependant on EU handouts</p><p>
</p><p>such as the trade unions and NGOs that the commission funds.</p><p>
</p><p>But does anybody outside this bubble believe we cannot reduce the budget yet increase its value?</p><p>
</p><p>If we want to solve the EU’s economic crisis then we need to overcome these vested interests that stand in our way.</p><p>
</p><p>They stop us from delivering a better Europe by constantly forcing us to deliver ‘more’ Europe. We can do more to help Europe’s economy – by doing less.</p><p>

Martin Callanan debate on European Council meeting March 2013,13-03-2013,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,920,"<p>
	</p><p>Mr President, let me start with the MFF deal reached at the last European Council. I know that many speakers here, such as Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Hughes, have said that they are tired of austerity and that they want a quick return to the spend, spend, spend mentality of the past, when governments tried desperately to win popularity by bribing their electorates with their own money – or in fact, worse still, by bribing them with their children’s money with excessive borrowing which, of course, eventually has to be paid off by future generations.</p><p>
</p><p>That era, as we all know, had to end. Across Europe, borrowing was out of control, caused in many cases by easy access to cheap credit because of the introduction of the euro. But even if things seem a little bit calmer at the moment, we must never forget that the underlying problems have not gone away. Some in this Chamber like to claim otherwise, but the state of European public finances across Europe is still extremely poor and so, whether we like it or not, austerity cannot be avoided.</p><p>
</p><p>It is, therefore, in my view, only right that the EU should play its part. When describing the EU budget you can of course use words like ‘investment’, if you like, but really, spending is spending, and the money has to be found from somewhere. It is simply extraordinary that many in this Chamber seem to think that our Member States should raise more taxes or borrow more money just to hand it over to the EU so that they can have a bigger budget and we can spend even more.</p><p>
</p><p>That is why, in my view, the MFF deal is so important. We need a financial framework that respects the sacrifices that are being made in the public finances in many of our Member States. I have already said that, in my view, this deal is far from perfect. I would have preferred to see a budget designed for 21st century priorities, with more support for R&D and perhaps less on agriculture. With more for new Member States and less on administration.</p><p>
</p><p>Nobody pretends that the deal reached by our leaders was perfect, but it is a compromise between many competing demands and so our position is of ‘yes, but’ rather than ‘no, unless’. This is reflected in our motion that will be voted on shortly.</p><p>
</p><p>I am pleased that the initial frenzied posturing from many in this House is now, I think, beginning to come around to a grudging acceptance of the budget numbers.</p><p>
</p><p>My Group can accept some of the requests being made today such as a mid-term review of the budget, provided that it is done under unanimity, for greater flexibility between the headings. But we continue to oppose new own resources. It would be devastating for Europe’s economy if we allow this House to raise taxes to fund whatever pet projects the Green’s have dreamed up today.</p><p>
</p><p>Let me turn to the idea raised by you, Mr President, of a secret ballot. I respect the rights of Members to ask for a secret vote in some circumstances, but that provision was never designed to allow Members to hide from the democratic scrutiny of their decisions on legislation or on the budget. If we are not accountable for our actions in one of the most important votes that we will take in this mandate, how can we claim any kind of democratic legitimacy in the future?</p><p>
</p><p>The House will know that normally, in these debates, I like to quote my conservative heroes of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Regan, but today Mr President I want to quote you. You said regarding a possible secret ballot on Turkey in 2005: ‘we believe that Europe’s citizens have a right to know how Members of the European Parliament are voting’. On this occasion I agree with you, Mr President.</p><p>
</p><p>For our sake and for the sake of our standing in the dock of public opinion, we must resoundingly reject the idea floated by you and this idea of a secret ballot should be buried once and for all. That is why, for the resolution today, my Group has tabled an amendment calling for a transparent decision on the MFF so that all those Members who have contacted me about it can put their feelings on the record, in public. Of course, while we cannot override the Rules of Procedure, it would be a clear and unambiguous statement that the majority in this House want normal, democratic procedures to apply to our vote on the MFF. I urge all Members to support it.</p><p>
</p><p>Finally, let me turn to the positive growth agenda for tomorrow’s European Council Meeting. No one should be allowed to get away with the idea that we have to somehow choose between austerity and growth. Sustainable growth is not achieved by throwing ever greater amounts of taxpayer’s money at the economy. It comes from having the right economies and the right policies in place, at the right time.</p><p>
</p><p>That is why we welcome the initiative from the Commission to publish a list of the ten most burdensome laws affecting small businesses. If every small business took on an extra member of staff, Europe would have no unemployment crisis. We need a reform agenda which places the creation of jobs and wealth by successful businesses at its very heart. I call on all Groups here to support that agenda.</p><p>

"Martin Callanan speech on Irish Presidency of the EU, with Taoiseach Enda Kenny",16-01-2013,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,651,"<p>
	</p><p>Good morning Taoiseach,</p><p>
</p><p>I welcome the fact that Ireland is taking on the Council Presidency at this crucial period.</p><p>
Indeed as someone who is himself half Irish, I am particularly pleased to have this opportunity to wish you well.</p><p>
</p><p>And I have every confidence that your presidency will be a success as Ireland has a distinguished track record in holding the office.</p><p>
</p><p>• Ireland’s second Presidency in 1979 saw the conclusion of the GATT agreement which opened up international trade.</p><p>
• Your 1990 Presidency helped to reunify the continent following the fall of the Berlin Wall,</p><p>
• and your 2004 Presidency welcomed former Soviet bloc states into the EU.</p><p>
</p><p>Now of course, it will not surprise you that my group does not agree with everything you have said today, or with all of your Presidency Priorities.</p><p>
</p><p>However, there is a significant amount on which my group can agree. In particular, we welcome the emphasis on growth, on jobs, and on stability.</p><p>
</p><p>We agree that developing the Single Market as a driver of economic growth must be a key priority. My group has long argued that it’s time for the Single Market to move into the digital age. There is much in Single Market Act 2 that delivers this important agenda and we will work with you in trying to deliver it. In your priorities you also talk about improving access to finance, and to public procurement for small businesses. We welcome this.</p><p>
</p><p>My group believes one small but important change that you could make is to the Council meetings themselves – by creating a dedicated Single Market Council meeting, rather than lumping this important policy area into other configurations.</p><p>
</p><p>It is essential that we re-prioritise Europe’s competiveness. Like much of Europe, your country was hit hard by the crisis, but you have made great progress in your fight back. Ireland is a fundamentally competitive economy compared to many in Europe. In particular you have rightly fought to preserve your low corporate tax rates. Ireland should be an example to the rest of Europe – particularly to President Hollande – showing that low tax rates lead to a more competitive economy, generating growth and creating wealth. I also welcome your sensible opposition to a Financial Transaction Tax which will be very damaging for those Member States adopting it.</p><p>
</p><p>I believe we also have a unique opportunity in the next few months to make substantial progress on an EU-USA free trade agreement. The first half of 2013 not only sees Ireland hold the Presidency of the EU, but also the UK holds the Presidency of the G8. I look forward to both Presidencies working hard to get such an agreement off the ground. In only a matter of months, it has gone from a pie in the sky ideal to a distinct possibility and, although agreement will be hard, the benefits of reducing tariffs would be incalculable both to our economies and to our transatlantic partnership.</p><p>
</p><p>Our peoples want to see Europe making a difference in those areas where it can genuinely add value. What they do not want to see is more institutional navel-gazing or theological blueprints for deepening Economic and Monetary Union.</p><p>
</p><p>We all know that there is little willingness by any member state to shift from entrenched positions on the eurozone crisis – whether in the north or the south. So let us not waste time or divert scarce resources trying to pretend otherwise.</p><p>
</p><p>Taoiseach, my hope is for you to be able to return here in the Summer saying you have laid the groundwork for more open and competitive markets, for a more complete digital Single Market, and for freer trade with major partners. That would indeed be a worthy legacy of your presidency.</p><p>
</p><p>I therefore wish you well in taking your country’s pro-growth, open markets and free enterprise ethos to the heart of the European debate and encourage others across our continent to follow your lead.</p><p>

"Martin Callanan speech during European Parliament debate on the Future of Europe, with Austrian Chancellor Faymann",15-01-2013,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,588,"<p>
	</p><p>Chancellor,</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the parliament today.</p><p>
</p><p>It is vital we have a serious debate about the future of Europe, a debate in which the full scale of Europe’s crisis is addressed.</p><p>
</p><p>It is not just about fixing the euro – although that is essential.</p><p>
</p><p>It is about recognising that in a global marketplace, Europe faces ever greater challenges that threaten our long term economic future.</p><p>
</p><p>It is about understanding that public opinion across the continent is increasingly alarmed at Europe’s direction.</p><p>
</p><p>It is just not good enough to dismiss their concerns as ignorant or populist: if the people have stopped trusting the EU it is because the EU seems to have stopped trusting the people. This must change.</p><p>
</p><p>Mr President, we need a new direction for Europe. That is why the ECR Group was created: to articulate a modern message setting out a new vision for Europe. We want to see European cooperation succeed, but this requires radical change in how we think and operate.</p><p>
</p><p>Today we stand at a crossroads. As the columnist Clive Crook recently wrote: “The European project is in trouble because the model — of a single, ever-closer union — has moved so far away from the reality of what people want and economies can stand.”</p><p>
</p><p>And that is why the EU needs a new model, not of inward-looking ever-closer union but a union of flexibility and practicality.</p><p>
</p><p>So, how can we achieve this ?</p><p>
</p><p>1. We can respond to this crisis by opening our markets and freeing enterprise from the dead hand of the state;</p><p>
</p><p>2. We can address the democratic deficit if we recognise that the nation state is not an outdated concept but the building block of legitimate government;</p><p>
</p><p>3. And we can take a practical, common sense approach to solving our common problems, rather than allowing ourselves to be driven by ideology or romanticism.</p><p>
</p><p>Here are a few places to start:</p><p>
</p><p>- A critical review of the entire Community acquis, slashing regulation that burdens our markets and businesses and costs jobs;</p><p>
</p><p>- A political drive to reinvigorate the Single Market through widening its scope and developing the digital economy;</p><p>
</p><p>- A thorough reprioritisation – line-by-line – of the EU budget so that it is focused on adding real value;</p><p>
</p><p>- and a change in gear in our efforts to open trade with the USA, with India, and with other emerging economies.</p><p>
</p><p>Mr President, these reforms will only be possible if we put an end to the mentality that we politicians have the answers to everyone’s problems. I’m particularly fond of the Ronald Reagan quote: “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help.’</p><p>
</p><p>Often our good intentions have unintended consequences. We can make it harder for people to take responsibility for themselves, or for businesses to deliver economic growth and employment. If Europe’s future is to be one of economic vibrancy then we need to realise that often the best thing politicians can do is to get out of the way.</p><p>
</p><p>Presidents, Chancellor, the Euro crisis has broken the consensus that we can just continue with ‘business as usual’. We need a fresh start and a new model: not an à la carte Europe, nor a Europe with first and second classes of Membership, but a flexible model, all converging around the Single Market in which every member can contribute according to their needs and interests – a Europe where all are equally valued and respected, a Union that is genuinely ‘united in diversity’.</p><p>

Preparations for the European Council meeting (22-23 November 2012) with particular reference to the Multiannual Financial Framework (debate),21-11-2012,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,272,"<p>
	</p><p>Martin Callanan, on behalf of the ECR Group . – Mr President, today’s debate has been slightly more heat than light. Mr Barroso, who has sadly now departed, told us that the EU budget is a catalyst for growth. He is right, assuming that you are a cow or a pig. They do extremely well out of the EU budget and I am sure they will grow very well if Mr Barroso’s spending plans go through.</p><p>
</p><p>Let me remind you of the history of this. It is not just Mr Cameron that is calling for a budget freeze. Two years ago six Member States signed the same letter as he did looking for a budget freeze and it is now of course only the socialists, the UK socialists, who are calling for a budget cut. Mr Cameron’s position is still for a budget freeze if he can achieve it.</p><p>
</p><p>Let me pick up on Mr Šefčovič’s slightly pathetic remarks about Birmingham City Council and the comparisons to the EU civil service, which would be laughable if he were not so serious. Birmingham City Council employs street cleaners, it employs garbage workers, it employs teachers, and those same civil servants have had a pay freeze for the last three years. What is more, they pay high levels of income tax. They do not pay the 16% income tax that your EU civil servants pay.</p><p>
</p><p>When you cut out the waste, when you cut out the fraud, when you cut out the irregular payments, when you cut out the errors in the budget, then come back to us and ask for more money.</p><p>

Callanan: “The EU is not short of money. It just spends it badly”,21-11-2012,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,903,"<p>
	</p><p>– Mr President, for my Group this debate encapsulates everything that needs to change about the EU. We reject the knee-jerk response of most of the people in this Chamber that the solution to every problem that we have in Member States is somehow ‘more Europe’. So, increasingly, does public opinion.</p><p>
I say to President Barroso that he and many other people in this Chamber have argued that the EU budget is there to promote economic growth. We have heard a lot of glib talk from all sides of this Chamber that it is an investment budget. If it was, perhaps on this side of the House we might support more bits of it, because nobody actually believes that it is an investment budget.</p><p>
</p><p>If it is an investment budget, how come 40 per cent of it is still spent on subsidies for farmers? What about the six per cent of the budget that is for administration costs? That is not about investment for growth either. Eight Member States – not just the UK – wrote to President Barroso saying that the EUR 2 billion cost of pensions for EU civil servants in the future was unaffordable and that reform was required. You completely ignored that letter.</p><p>
</p><p>Mr Barroso, how can you insist – and how can the rest of you insist – that we need more spending and more money at an EU level? Five per cent of the existing budget, according to the Court of Auditors, is either spent illegally or irregularly – something like EUR 5 billion. If that money was accounted for properly, if the Commission got its expenditure controls in place, then that would take up almost all of the increase that you are all asking for.</p><p>
</p><p>Let us ask about some of the existing projects. Is that all money well spent? How has doubling the number of EU agencies in the last eight years affected growth across Europe? What about the new ECB building in Frankfurt that cost several hundred million euros? How is that going to contribute to more growth in Greece? And what about our presence here in Strasbourg? That costs EUR 200 million a year. How is that contributing to growth in Member States? It is not, of course. Nobody seriously believes that it is.</p><p>
Mr Barroso, the EU is not short of money. It just spends the money that it has very, very badly. Let us be quite clear about this. To meet your demands for more spending, virtually every contributing Member State is going to have to borrow that extra money. They are going to have to cut their public expenditure in order to send more money to the EU.</p><p>
It is completely unsustainable, it is unhelpful, and many Member States will not stand for it. Can you seriously, in all good conscience, ask those Member States to borrow that extra money to make cuts at home so that we can all spend more money here in Europe?</p><p>
</p><p>It is time for the EU to spend the money that it already has better so that it creates growth in national economies. Instead of demanding yet more money, why not take the time to go through the existing budget, line by line, asking yourself whether this item of expenditure really results in more economic growth in Europe?</p><p>
It is not just Conservatives who are saying these things, Mr Swoboda. Even some of the socialists, I am pleased to say, are starting to see the light. The UK socialists actually want a cut in the budget, not just a freeze, which is Mr Cameron’s position. They voted in the House of Commons for a cut. And what about your great, latter-day socialist hero, President Hollande? He fought an election – remember that? – on an end to austerity. What is he saying now? He said last week that ‘we must be ready to do better by spending less’. That is the great socialist hero that you tell us is setting an example for the rest of Europe to follow.</p><p>
</p><p>Let me say a word about new Member States. I think that enlargement has been one of the EU’s great success stories. I think that we have to accept that it will cost more money to support those Member States whose infrastructure was neglected in their communist past. That is why I believe that cohesion spending for new Member States should be maintained, even within an overall freeze or a cut in the Multiannual Financial Framework.</p><p>
The way to do that is through budgetary reform, so that cohesion policy is limited to helping those countries that need it most. It is ridiculous that 40 per cent of current structural and cohesion funding goes to the EU’s richest countries. Countries like my own should be freed to support our poor regions ourselves without funnelling the money through the inefficient mechanism of the EU budget. I agree with the proposals put forward by our previous socialist government that cohesion policy should be repatriated to the richer Member States and that money only be used to fund the poorer Member States who deserve that spending.</p><p>
</p><p>I am a bit of an optimist. I believe that a better budget – not just a bigger budget – is still achievable in the summit this week. I hope that Member States, with good grace and goodwill, will sit down and agree that we need better EU spending and not just more EU spending.</p><p>

Callanan: EU summit took euro progress backwards – Leadership lacking in Europe,23-10-2012,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,674,"<p>
	</p><p>– Mr President, there were some good things to come out of last week’s Council meeting. For instance, there was the support for the single market of 27 Member States, developing more open trade, the cutting of some red tape and the withdrawal of some pending Commission proposals. These were all good things. However, we need to see more action on all of those initiatives and my group will certainly support Mr Barroso in taking these initiatives forward.</p><p>
However, when it comes to the main topic of debate – yet again the euro crisis – we can see that the summit manifestly failed to deliver. Both Mr Van Rompuy and Mr Barroso spoke in this Chamber after the previous summit in June. They spoke about balancing solidarity with responsibility and described the results back then as ‘significant’. They said that these took Europe a few more steps down the road to recovery. Well, of course, over the summer it became clear that some key Member States had had second thoughts about what they agreed then, and the few small steps forward were overwhelmed by some pretty giant leaps backwards.</p><p>
</p><p>The only significance of that summit, with hindsight, was that it represented yet another missed opportunity. The window created by the actions of the ECB to enable political leaders to get ahead of the curve in reassuring the markets was lost then, and it is lost now. No amount of fudging over the timetable for the supervisory mechanisms or the carefully chosen words about mutual support can cover up for the fact that this summit simply backtracked on what had been agreed.</p><p>
</p><p>I have a lot of sympathy for both Mediterranean Europe and Northern Europe, but we cannot go on with this stalemate, with one side unwilling to hand over budgetary sovereignty and the other side unwilling to hand over its chequebook and its cash. It seems to me that, as Mr Verhofstadt observed, we now have no chance of making any headway towards a solution to the crisis before the elections in Germany. The problem that we face is quite simply one of leadership. To take a topical example that has been mentioned in this debate, when the EU was awarded this famous Nobel Prize, the bickering began immediately about who was going to collect the prize, who was going to make the speech and who was going to talk at the dinner. I started thinking about all of those political leaders and organisations who actually really deserved to collect that prize for delivering peace in Europe, for holding firm during the Cold War and for challenging the might of the Soviet Union. I thought about the contributions of General de Gaulle, President Reagan, Prime Ministers Kohl and Thatcher, NATO, and Pope Jean Paul II. No doubt everyone in this Chamber has some figure that they want to put forward as contributing to that list. It seems to me that they had one thing in common – they had political courage, the courage to stand firm, to take political risks and to make sacrifices for what they believed in.</p><p>
</p><p>What a sad contrast to the modern day Europe of today, where difficult decisions are delayed, timetables slip, and political realities are ignored. It was sobering to note that that Nobel Prize was awarded to the EU, not because we are dealing effectively with the current crisis, but because we are failing to do so. It is not a message of congratulations to Europe’s leaders, it is an act of charity. The prize has not been given to the EU because it is strong and doing well. It has been given now because the EU is weak and doing badly. That was made clear in the citation itself – in the announcement – if you read it.</p><p>
</p><p>So let us put aside the self-congratulations and let us forget the mutual backstabbing. Let us get on instead with the difficult task of making the urgent decisions that are required to make the European economy competitive and to launch the project again.</p><p>

"Callanan: Barroso presents same old, tired approach. Change of direction needed",12-09-2012,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,1156,"<p>
	</p><p>– Mr President, two weeks ago I was privileged to be with Mr Daul and others from this House in Tampa, where Mitt Romney told the Republican National Convention: ‘I wish President Obama had succeeded because I want America to succeed, but his promises gave way to disappointment and division’.</p><p>
I wish to say to President Barroso: my group supported you for a second term. We wanted you to succeed in shaping a positive agenda for reform of the EU. In some areas, such as international trade or the single market, your Commission has made some progress which we welcome, and we welcome your further announcements today of progress on the single market. But overall I have to say we are very disappointed. Rather than seeing European renewal, as you yet again promised last year, all we have seen is the same old tired approach: more Europe rather than better Europe.</p><p>
</p><p>Exactly two years ago the main initiative to emerge from your State of the Union speech was project bonds. Two years on, nothing has happened, they are merely at a pilot phase. Last year your big idea was an EU-wide financial transactions tax, and today thankfully that idea is dead in the water. This year we have a banking union, we have more Treaty change – the knee-jerk reflex of the European elite to every crisis. You told us today that we have the power to shape the world. Mr Barroso, can I suggest that first of all you concentrate on solving the problems of Europe before you worry about shaping the rest of the world?</p><p>
</p><p>And so far, the response to the euro zone crisis has been characterised by seeking short-term, sticking-plaster solutions and long-term institutional navel-gazing. Listening to you today it looks as though that is going to continue. Bail-outs – ECB Ponzi schemes – have enabled you to kick the infamous can even further down the road, and last week’s ECB decision to buy up bonds may be, as some Members have said, a useful stop-gap, but it is in no sense a solution. Risks have simply been transferred from one balance sheet to another.</p><p>
The essential nonsense of this current approach was for me brilliantly illustrated over the summer. If you remember, Greece had to repay a EUR 5 billion loan to the ECB, so to do this they issued new short-term bonds. All of these bonds were bought by Greek banks. Those Greek banks are, of course, all technically bust. So where did they get the money from? They borrowed it from the ECB to pay the Greek state who then gave it back to the ECB again.</p><p>
</p><p>Mr President, this is exactly the kind of financial chicanery which caused the economic crisis in the first place, and now you want us to have another long drawn-out academic debate about more Treaty change, about a banking union. We will scrutinise your proposals very carefully to make sure that they respect the rights of those Member States that thankfully chose not to join the euro. We wish to maintain the integrity of the single market and ensure that your proposals do not damage that market.</p><p>
The euro was, of course, a political project from the start. I well remember the many debates in this House we had about it, where the political symbolism was much more important than the economic reality. I bet many of you are regretting that now. Well, President, we are now in an economic crisis and it will be solved with economic solutions, by confronting some fairly stark economic truths.</p><p>
</p><p>It is a reality – and Members have referred to this, Mr Barroso referred to this – that some euro zone countries are less competitive than others. For them, the euro is acting like a straitjacket, preventing the currency devaluation that would give them time to put in place longer-term reforms. And to illustrate how urgent the problem is, I agree with Mr Swoboda, a new report from the ILO shows that Spain now has the highest documented unemployment rate in the world. Greece unfortunately comes second. This is misery on an epic scale in those countries, and we really should do something about it. So let us be honest about it. Let us be honest with ourselves.</p><p>
The only way that the euro can be made to work with 17 members is if the people of Germany, the people of the Netherlands, the people of Finland, are prepared to transfer cash – not loans, cash – from their taxpayers’ pockets in order to bridge the competitiveness gap. Now I do not think that is ever going to happen and the people of those countries deserve our understanding of why that is not possible.</p><p>
</p><p>So surely the only other alternative is for some countries to leave the euro, to devalue their currencies and for us to support them as they find the right policies that will return them to sustainable public spending and growth in the long-term. The euro area needs to be restructured, and I do not say that with delight, Mr Barroso. I say it because I think it is the only realistic course of action that will deliver for people who are desperate for a solution.</p><p>
</p><p>The EU faces a crisis of leadership. Mr Barroso told us so himself last year in the State of the Union address, and I agree with him in that particular case. The EU does face a crisis of leadership. It needs a leadership that faces the economic reality of the euro crisis and does not keep avoiding the problem. We need new leadership that respects our nation states as building blocks of democracy which should be supported and not undermined.</p><p>
</p><p>We take away people’s right to control their destiny through the ballot box at our peril. Already frustrated, angry and fearful people are toying with extremist forces and the alarm bells should be ringing. On that point, and on that point alone, I agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit.</p><p>
We need a new leadership which will tackle Europe’s fundamental competitiveness crisis in the wider global economy and which will pursue a new direction to relaunch growth along the lines outlined by 12 EU prime ministers in their letter in February.</p><p>
</p><p>In America, Governor Romney has set out a plan for how he would renew America by returning it to a land of personal ambition, enterprise and freedom. In the EU we come from the same traditions and we are at our best when government is small, when markets are free and when the people exercise control over their government.</p><p>
</p><p>Mr Barroso, I still hope that, as you prepare your work programme for next year, it is not too late for you to shake off the policies of the past and to champion genuine reform of the EU so that it can become relevant to today’s reality and help us to succeed in facing the difficult years ahead.</p><p>

"Callanan welcomes Cypriot Presidency, and responds to Barroso’s ‘outburst’",04-07-2012,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,596,"<p>
	</p><p>– Mr President, let me first of all thank President Christofias for his speech today and for the welcome that he gave to my group when we recently visited Cyprus. We greatly appreciated the constructive meetings that we had with him and his government. It is clear that we are not going to have much in common politically, but nevertheless we did appreciate his courtesy and his hospitality. We also agree with the implication in the Presidency’s priorities that the EU is not seen as relevant by many of its citizens, and that it needs to become more effective and more efficient. The position of my group is clear: we do not want to see the EU fail, but if it continues to pursue the agenda of the past then it most surely will.</p><p>
Let me say a word to President Barroso. I was particularly surprised by his outburst yesterday here in this Chamber. To suggest that somehow we take great delight in the problems facing the euro is, frankly, absurd. Do you honestly believe that we are pleased to see so many people suffer as a result of your political project? I have merely many times set out the options for the eurozone as I see them: either an effective fiscal union or a reduction in the size of the eurozone. At the moment you are trying to move towards a political union without the fiscal union that is really required, and I think that it is entirely reasonable that we should raise the alarm about what this will mean for national democracy in many Member States.</p><p>
</p><p>Whether or not the euro survives, what is important for me is that those countries that had the good sense to stay out of it are not hampered by the decision of 17 to go ahead with more integration, if indeed that is what they choose to do. But of course, the one tool that must always remain the equal property of the 27 countries is the single market. It is the one thing that we all support, and I was therefore delighted see that the Cyprus Presidency has said that one of its ambitions is the deepening of that internal market. You will have our full support in that aim.</p><p>
</p><p>The Presidency will also conclude negotiations on the Capital Requirements Directive. Yesterday, as part of his criticisms, President Barroso pointed out – correctly – the UK’s significant bank bailout commitments made under our previous, Socialist, government. I agree with him that we should ensure that banks are sufficiently capitalised to present this from ever happening again. So why, then, is the Commission still trying to water down the commitments the EU made in Basel to implement the Capital Requirements Directive? Mr Barroso, my group, and indeed the UK Government, is in favour of more stringent bank regulation than your Commission. We want to make sure that taxpayers never again have to bail out the banks.</p><p>
Turning very briefly to the multiannual financial framework, it still continues to baffle me how the Commission can enforce austerity on Member States and simultaneously demand more money from them for the EU budget. It seems that everyone has to cut spending, apart from the European Commission.</p><p>
</p><p>The idea that throwing money at economic problems and hoping it will make them go away is surely a doctrine that was discredited in the 1970s. If the Presidency can truly deliver a budget that genuinely focuses on quality and added value, and on better spending rather than on more spending, you will indeed have our full support.</p><p>

Danish Presidency of the EU marked by ‘typically Danish efficiency and practicality’,03-07-2012,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,446,"<p>
	</p><p>– Mr President, I want to do two things this morning.</p><p>
First of all, I want to wish the Secretary-General of Parliament a very happy birthday. I am sure he is delighted to be having to spend his birthday listening to us drone on in this Chamber. Secondly, and much more importantly, I would like to thank the Danish Presidency, their officials and ministers and all those whom we have dealt with over the last six months.</p><p>
Of course, Prime Minister, as a Socialist while I myself am a Conservative, I am sure there are many issues on which we would disagree. However, I would like to pay tribute to the typical Danish efficiency and practicality which has been sorely needed in the EU over the last six months. In particular your Presidency should be congratulated for burying the financial transactions tax as an EU-wide initiative. It would have damaged many of the EU’s financial centres, and many ordinary savers and investors as well.</p><p>
Your administration should also be thanked for refusing to reopen negotiations on the Pregnant Workers Directive, which would have raised costs for businesses, reduced women’s choice and made it harder for many young women to find jobs. You should also be congratulated as a member of the EU net contributors club for pushing for budget restraint within the EU as well.</p><p>
</p><p>In fact when I look at many of the policy areas, it seems there are many lessons that you could teach the wider Socialist family about the responsibilities of power should you ever choose to come back to this Parliament.</p><p>
</p><p>Regarding the row over the Schengen evaluation mechanism, I have to say you have my sympathy on this. After all, the decision to change the legal base was made unanimously by the Council – a Council which, as Mr Daul and others often remind us, is made up predominantly of leaders of the EPP. I think it is very unfair that the messenger should be shot over this incident.</p><p>
</p><p>That aside, I think the Danish Presidency’s overall relationship with Parliament has been extremely good and I would like to thank in particular your Europe Minister sitting behind you, Mr Wammen, for all the work that he has done. He sat there tirelessly day after day in this Chamber, having to listen to a lot of brickbats and criticisms. I think he has done it extremely well, extremely courteously, and I am sure he has a great future ahead in your government.</p><p>
</p><p>Prime Minister, overall your Presidency has been a good honest broker between the institutions and we come away with a positive assessment of Denmark’s time at the helm.</p><p>

Callanan: The EU faces another crisis of legitimacy,13-06-2012,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,504,"<p>
	</p><p>– Mr President, Europe is facing yet another in its long line of crises, only this time, in my view, it is fast becoming a crisis of the legitimacy of the EU itself.</p><p>
Many of us warned that a monetary union with a light touch, which was envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty, could not work and, for a single currency to succeed, significant centralisation of power would be required – a centralisation which for many of us was totally unacceptable. That is where the EU finds itself today. It is bringing more centralisation upon itself in what is an increasingly desperate attempt to get ahead of the crisis, which so far it has completely failed to do.</p><p>
</p><p>When the markets are unimpressed, when the Spanish banks are lent EUR 100 billion, then there is a clear signal that the failure is continuing. This latest Spanish bailout lasted barely 24 hours before it was, as Mr Verhofstadt said, being questioned on the markets. If I can use a somewhat crude analogy, it is a little bit like wetting your pants at the North Pole. At first it feels warm and comforting but very quickly you realise just how much trouble you are in fact in.</p><p>
</p><p>Let me make two points. First, it would be unacceptable that the measures it is proposed we take should fall upon those who proposed originally to steer clear of this risky venture and, second, those countries who signed up to join a single currency with one set of governing rules should not now be obliged to join a single currency with a completely different set of governing rules. So those countries that are not yet in the euro should be released from their obligation to join.</p><p>
</p><p>Over the last 20 years, the EU has become ever more out of touch with public opinion, and that has shown in many recent elections and referendums. The people of Europe are becoming increasingly worried about centralisation, and about the remoteness of those who are gaining more power in the EU by the day. In no area is this seen more starkly than the management of the EU budget. The Commission talks about synergies, about investments, about added value, and the public just sees waste, mismanagement and fraud.</p><p>
An even bigger budget is being requested. The public just wonders why it is that for 17 years in succession the budget has been implemented with significantly high levels of illegal or irregular payments. People here are complaining that the concept of value for money is somehow getting in the way of European solidarity. The public just wonders how on earth one can justify wanting even more money when the money already being spent is spent so badly.</p><p>
</p><p>To win back public legitimacy and regain trust the EU needs to take reform seriously, it needs to respond to the needs of the people and not impose ideas upon them. Make no mistake, when we are facing so many different crises on so many fronts, we are very fast running out of time.</p><p>

Callanan: EU summit failing to address collapse in competitiveness,22-05-2012,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,769,"<p>
	</p><p>– Mr President, we are having yet another European summit. I make it the 22nd that we have had in the last two and a half years. Mr Verhofstadt said it was the 18th but it would not be the first time that he has got his numbers wrong!</p><p>
I do not know what else Mr Van Rompuy has done, but he has certainly been very good at calling summits. None of the others have made any material difference so why, we ask ourselves, should this one? The reason that they have all so far failed is that none of them has addressed the real problem which, of course, is the collapse of European competitiveness. I think all of us in this House have a common objective. We all, of course, want the old mantra of growth and jobs, yet we have very different views on how that should be achieved.</p><p>
</p><p>For the socialists, across several groups in this House, only more government spending can create growth. I fundamentally disagree. The socialist vision of growth is an illusion created at the expense of borrowing and tax rises, and it is totally irresponsible in the current climate. As my favourite politician, Margaret Thatcher, once said, the problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of everybody else’s money. We cannot afford a return to the discredited socialist growth agenda of Keynesianism dressed up as more investment.</p><p>
</p><p>Economic growth does not need state intervention. In fact, very often state intervention actually restricts growth. Take, for example, the Agency Workers Directive. This well-meaning piece of legislation, introduced through this House, has resulted in a fall in the number of temporary workers being employed in France. The Working Time Directive actually stops people from working. In a crisis, it is utterly immoral. So-called social protection legislation in the EU is failing to protect us from the worst social injustice of all, which is unemployment. We risk having the best protected workforce in the world, but no workers.</p><p>
</p><p>More flexible labour markets are the way forward. EU leaders should ask which employment directive they can repeal immediately.</p><p>
We also need, as others have said, a bonfire of red tape. Each piece of additional legislation acts like a pin in the body of our economy. It can survive a few, but eventually it will be killed by a thousand pinpricks. The Commission’s inertia-driven ‘better regulation’ agenda should be replaced by a politically driven deregulation agenda, and this Parliament can play a role here by spending more of our time considering how to repeal, refine and reform existing measures. The EU needs to do less and it needs to do it better.</p><p>
</p><p>I have talked about what we can do less of. What can we do better? Commissioners, the answer lies in the letter signed by 12 Heads of Government. They sent you a clear set of ideas for extending the single market, for pursing free-trade agreements, for a European research area, and no end of good proposals. Sadly, the reaction from Presidents Barroso and Van Rompuy was disappointing. They continue to fall back on the Europe 2020 agenda.</p><p>
That agenda is lacking because it tries to be all things to all men. It contains some things to appeal to a liberal conservative like me, it has parts to appeal to socialists like Mr Swoboda, and even parts to appeal to a social democrat like Mr Verhofstadt. There are probably no parts that appeal to Nigel Farage, but then again the Commissioners are not miracle workers. Europe 2020 will not work unless it learns the lessons of the failed Lisbon strategy, which did not achieve its primary goal.</p><p>
</p><p>My message to the Commission is this: we need a strong, free-trade, pro-competition agenda from you. At the moment, the Commission is effectively rudderless. The letter showed you the way forward and yet you disregarded it. The reform that the EU needs will not come about from one additional dinner, but tomorrow’s meeting can make an important start. It should give the Commission a clear message that it wants to see a free-trade, deregulatory and pro-market agenda. It should tell the Commission to go away and rethink the next seven-year budget so that every euro focuses on added-value outputs, rather than simply increasing national contribution inputs. Most importantly, it should place the single market at the heart of our economic recovery. Unless we resolve our competitiveness crisis, we will never resolve the many other crises facing the EU.</p><p>
</p><p>How many more dinners and summits will it take before we actually get some action that will make a difference?</p><p>

Callanan: Roll back the frontiers of the EU’s ‘Big government’,09-05-2012,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,839,"<p>
	</p><p>– Mr President, Schuman, Monnet and Spinelli all lived in a very different Europe to the one of today. In their Europe, the continent had been ravaged by two world wars. In their Europe, the household challenge was putting food on the table. The global challenge became symbolised by a wall across Berlin. Their solutions were ever-closer union, the European social model and the common agricultural policy. In their day, those policies helped to achieve some of their objectives. Enlargement to the east brought freedom to a people previously cloaked by an iron curtain.</p><p>
But the world has moved on since the Schuman Declaration was made 62 years ago and sadly, in many areas, the EU has not. Many of those 20th century solutions have now become a part of the 21st century problem. The EU is not only becoming irrelevant in the world, but also in the minds of many of our own people. I have one simple explanation for that. The people do not trust the EU because the EU does not trust the people.</p><p>
</p><p>Democracy, the rule of the people, is the greatest Greek export in history and it is under threat. The euro, the Fiscal Compact, the impositions of the troika and endless EU legislation have stopped our electors from having the power to determine their own destinies. We cannot go on taking the people for granted. If we do, they will turn to ugly alternatives. Sadly, communists and neo-Nazis who want to place landmines on the Greek border are now a major part of the Greek Parliament. Ms Le Pen received a fifth of the vote in France. And yet what was the Commission’s response to the first-round upset in France? More Europe is needed, we were told by a spokesman. To me, nothing better sums up everything that is wrong with the EU than that reaction.</p><p>
</p><p>We feel that we have all of the answers and the Commission’s Schuman Day statement just backs up that assumption. But often our well-intentioned actions become part of the problem and lead to less personal or economic freedom for individuals. To paraphrase a famous quote of President Reagan, the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: ‘I am from the EU and I am here to help’. I am a firm believer that small government works. When national governments have rolled back the frontiers of the state, they have found that their people and their economies thrive. The EU has become a big government. It is time to roll back its frontiers.</p><p>
</p><p>Many people have suggested that Sunday’s election was a victory for pro-growth politicians replacing pro-austerity politicians. That is, of course, nonsense. Everybody that I know – maybe apart from a few of the Greens – actually wants growth. The battle is over means and not ends. Sustainable growth requires profitably producing and selling more goods and services. Getting the EU to borrow and spend even more money to create fake demand at a time when national debts are already spiralling out of control is not pro-growth. It is stupid, it is unsustainable and it will bring national bankruptcy a step closer for many states.</p><p>
</p><p>My group is happy to offer an alternative vision for the future of the EU based on liberty, national democracy and proper entrepreneur-led growth. We believe that free trade is the best way to promote our products and our values across the globe. We believe that the EU budget should be better focused, smaller and reprioritised to 21st century challenges such as research. We believe that the single market should be the jewel in the crown of the EU, promoting deregulation and competition rather than red tape and harmonisation.</p><p>
Seven years ago in this Chamber, following the French and Dutch rejections of the European constitution, one of the north-east constituents of Stephen Hughes and myself, Prime Minister Tony Blair, told this Chamber that people are blowing the trumpets around the city walls. Are we listening? I think we know the answer to the question that he posed, but the trumpets are sounding even louder now today than they were in 2005.</p><p>
</p><p>We have to ask ourselves whether we are, in fact, listening to what the people have to say today, because the EU faces clear choices. We can continue to pass more legislation, we can have ten-year economic plans, or we can cut red tape and lift the burden on businesses. We can continue to believe that we know best or we can trust the people to know what is right. We can continue with the mantra of an ever-closer union or we can build an effective union that does less, but does it better. It is not too late to face reality, to trust the people and to embrace small government in Brussels, but time is rapidly running out.</p><p>
</p><p>Unless we change course, the world will keep turning and Europe will fall further and further behind in the international competitive league table – and we will only have ourselves to blame.</p><p>

Callanan: The Euro zone sugar rush has worn off time for euro leaders to make a decision,18-04-2012,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,456,"<p>
	</p><p>– Mr President, the eurozone has experienced several months now, as Mr Verhofstadt reminded us, of a sort of sugar rush, thanks to the ECB’s cheap credit. Now the sugar has worn off and the hangover is well and truly kicking in – and, unsurprisingly, we discover that the eurozone faces all the same problems that it faced beforehand. Solutions will only be identified when our leaders finally decide to put the economics ahead of the politics and hard-headed realism ahead of financial federalist romanticism.</p><p>
</p><p>My group, fortunately, represents predominantly non-euro nations, so I feel best placed to offer some impartial, honest and realistic advice. It is all part of the service that we offer, Guy. As I see it, there are two rational options. Either, firstly, Germany and some of the other Northern European States accept that they are going to have to enter into a full-scale fiscal transfer union with permanent flows of money – not just loans – from Northern Europe to Southern Europe, or, alternatively, we allow the lightning rod of this crisis – which has become the poor people of Greece – the opportunity to leave the euro and to devalue their way back into the marketplace.</p><p>
</p><p>I can understand why German taxpayers and Dutch taxpayers and others are rather reticent about allowing their hard-earned taxes to flow to a number of unreformed countries. Similarly, I can sympathise with the poor Greeks, who are reluctant to hand over any more of their economic sovereignty. That leaves us only with the option that Greece should be allowed to leave the eurozone, to default and to devalue.</p><p>
</p><p>A 10-year-old child could work that out. In fact, a 10-year-old child did work that out. I have here a Wolfson Prize essay from Jurre Hermans, who is a 10-year-old from the Netherlands, and it sets out a plan for how Greece can leave the euro. He won a prize for it. I particularly like the picture that he drew illustrating how all this would successfully work. In his essay, Jurre says ‘I think about solutions’ – which, I have to say, is more than can be said for some of the euro’s leaders. Instead of solutions, what we have seen is finger pointing, and I agree with Spanish Prime Minister Rajoy that it is not right for others – most notably the electioneering Nicholas Sarkozy – to point fingers in the direction of Spain. Instead, it is time for the euro leaders to make a decision. The choices are simple: either Germany and Northern Europe pays, or Greece leaves, or the euro fails.</p><p>
</p><p>The choice seems obvious to me; it seems obvious to 10-year-old Jurre. I am just sorry that it does not seem so obvious to some of our eurozone leaders.</p><p>

Martin Callanan: Shocking complacency taking hold in EU corridors of power,13-03-2012,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,671,"<p>
	</p><p>– Mr President, I am becoming increasingly concerned that a sort of corrupting complacency is starting to take hold in EU corridors of power. Many seem to now believe that the worst of the crisis is over. After all, we have signed the new treaty to solve it all, and some are implying that Europe is really OK; the only problem is that a few Mediterranean countries have a problem with their public finances and it is nothing that the new treaty cannot put right. Well, Europe is not OK. The underlying economic weakness is a problem shared by the whole of our continent and the new treaty is simply an irrelevance to most of it.</p><p>
</p><p>I am pleased to say that two Member States, both from parties led by my group, have been honest enough to say that there is no point in signing this treaty. Others have signed it and have indicated that they do not really believe that it applies to them. Before the ink was even dry on the treaty, Spain and the Netherlands said that they were not going to comply with its provisions.</p><p>
</p><p>The European Council has wasted considerable energy on a treaty that will make no practical difference to the fundamentals, whilst taking decisions at the same time that will condemn the Greek people to a generation of poverty. Greece now faces the prospect of one of the longest recessions in recorded history, a collapse in living standards and levels of unemployment unseen in Europe since the 1930s. The solution, of course, is not easy and it is not without cost, but a new course must surely now be followed. Measures are required so that Greece can organise an orderly default, but a default that needs to be complemented by leaving the euro so that devaluation can save its economy in the short term, while structural reforms are taken to rebuild it in the medium term.</p><p>
</p><p>But the complacency shown when it comes to the fundamental state of the EU economy is equally profoundly shocking. There was a letter, signed by 12 Heads of Government, from three political families in this House, which was presented to the Council. It was an opportunity to relaunch a constructive growth agenda in Europe, but the initial reaction was very cool, as you know, Mr Van Rompuy. Surely, the time has now come for you to stop behaving as if Council communiqués have been delegated to the foreign ministries of France and Germany. Why did you not immediately face the opportunity to focus on a positive forward-looking agenda for real economic growth? Perhaps, when you asked the Council to put jobs on the agenda, you were, in fact, only referring to yours – congratulations on your reappointment, by the way.</p><p>
</p><p>Mr Barroso, should this not be the kind of growth agenda that is the centre piece of the work of your Commission and should define its purpose? Is that not what we were promised? The global competitive challenge requires a determined policy response from the whole Commission, not just from one or two Commissioners who understand what is at stake. Perhaps the Commission should spend a little more time on pursing real reform and a little less time on producing silly, racist, martial arts videos.</p><p>
</p><p>I hope that you will also take this opportunity to condemn Sunday’s remarks from the President of France calling for restriction, calling for more protectionism on trade. We should be abolishing trade barriers, not erecting more of them. Apparently, last week, President Sarkozy also said that there are too many foreigners in France. Well, I am a foreigner in France and I say to him that I would be very happy not to have to come back to this Parliament in France every month – and it is his government that actually makes us come here in the first place.</p><p>
</p><p>There are several hundred foreigners who would be very happy not to come back to France every month if that is really what President Sarkozy wants.</p><p>

Martin Callanan: Speech in a debate in the European Parliament with Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti,15-02-2012,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,392,"<p>
	</p><p>Mr President, as another famous Monty – Monty Python – taught us: ‘always look on the bright side of life.’ Although the news is gloomy, there are reasons for Italy to be optimistic.</p><p>
</p><p>Italy is not Greece.</p><p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, the national current account has been mismanaged – going from a healthy surplus to a near-crippling deficit in merely a decade.</p><p>
</p><p>It appears – so far – that the markets respect your leadership, Prime Minister.</p><p>
</p><p>Ten-year bond yields are almost at a manageable position: thanks partly to your proposed economic reforms and partly to the actions of the ECB which have bought you some time.</p><p>
</p><p>In Italy, fiscal consolidation and economic reform could work. In Greece, they are clearly not working.</p><p>
</p><p>An orderly default and Greek euro exit may be bad politics for Angela Merkel but I believe it is the least-worst option for the Eurozone and the EU as a whole.</p><p>
</p><p>Fiscal consolidation will ease the current crisis but, in isolation, it is not the long-term solution to our economic weakness. The answer, as many people have said, is growth.</p><p>
</p><p>We have no shortage of policy statements calling for growth and jobs. But let’s be honest. So far, they have failed – because they focus more on buzzwords and gestures aimed at keeping everyone happy, and they are based on the premise that somehow politicians can create jobs.</p><p>
</p><p>That is the kind of bureaucratic statist attitude that put us in this situation in the first place.</p><p>
Of course there is one recent European economic policy paper that is being put into practice: the Mario Monti report on the Single Market.</p><p>
</p><p>In my view, the greatest problem that we face in Europe is that competition has been undermined by the focus on harmonisation instead of liberalisation. You need only look at EU employment policy to see the devastating impact it has had on our economies.</p><p>
</p><p>The Single Market has the ability to deliver more liberal and flexible economies across the EU. The answer is not more harmonisation, not more rules and red tape, not ‘more Europe’. The answer is a ‘better’ Europe, a Europe of liberalisation and competition.</p><p>
</p><p>Professor Monti, as Prime Minister of Italy you have a great opportunity to articulate this vision, to champion economic restructuring and liberalisation – not just in Italy, but across Europe. If you succeed, my group will be the first to applaud you.</p><p>

Martin Callanan: speech in a debate on the March 2012 EU summit,14-02-2012,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,358,"<p>
	</p><p>European politics is no longer anchored in reality. EU summits are becoming a political ritual, divorced from the real world.</p><p>
</p><p>Every summit comes and goes with the same old mantras and demonstrations of hope triumphing over experience:</p><p>
</p><p>- a bit more austerity here and immediately confidence in the euro will come flooding back;</p><p>
- another treaty package to tinker with the rules and the markets will suddenly realise the euro is sound after all,</p><p>
- stern-faced leaders emerge, gazing at the cameras and they recite the same old mantra: “We will do everything it takes to save the Euro”.</p><p>
</p><p>Mr President, if politics has traditionally been seen as the art of the possible, the European Union is turning it into the art of delusion.</p><p>
</p><p>This nonsense needs to stop. The risks are just too great for yet another summit to come and go which fails to face reality.</p><p>
</p><p>Let me start with Greece and the eurozone crisis. Nobody believes that the latest package will save Greece:</p><p>
- Neither the Greek MPs who voted for it,</p><p>
- Nor any international economists</p><p>
- Not even the German Finance Minister!</p><p>
</p><p>Even if all the measures agreed on Sunday night are implemented – and that looks increasingly unlikely – then by 2020, after eight more years of grinding austerity, Greece would still be in a worse position than Italy is now!</p><p>
</p><p>Greece is suffering from a 30% loss of competitiveness against Germany. How do you eliminate such a deficit?</p><p>
</p><p>Economic reform will, in the long-term, be essential.</p><p>
</p><p>But in the short-term, there is only one solution: a devaluation coupled with a default is the only way to salvage something from the wreckage of the Greek economy and to save a generation or more of young Greeks from a miserable economic inheritance.</p><p>
</p><p>All the energy currently being devoted to drafting and ratifying a new treaty that is irrelevant to the ongoing crisis would be better employed drafting and implementing a plan for the orderly withdrawal of Greece from the euro, including carefully prepared support for the banks that will be most affected.</p><p>
</p><p>That is the sustainable solution – everything else is just a very expensive exercise in kicking the can down the road.</p><p>

Martin Callanan MEP: Speech in a debate on the outcome of the February 2012 EU summit,14-02-2012,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,582,"<p>
	</p><p>There seems to be some agreement in this House today that even if the fiscal compact is adopted and ratified – far from a foregone conclusion – it will do nothing solve the current crisis.</p><p>
</p><p>As a fiscal conservative, I should of course be delighted that we are enshrining fiscal discipline and balanced budgets within national laws and constitutions.</p><p>
</p><p>However, as a Democrat, what greatly concerns me is that an electorate’s ability to vote for a high spending Keynesian economic policy is effectively being removed from them. We are making Socialism illegal!</p><p>
</p><p>This pact is effectively rendering all elections null and void across much of Europe.</p><p>
</p><p>So let me say this, as a free-market conservative who finds much to admire in the German model of fiscal and monetary discipline. We can’t impose our vision by force of law. We need to use force of argument.</p><p>
</p><p>We need to show that austerity is not forever, that there is light at the end of the tunnel. But as long as we cut off the possibility of a country leaving the euro, we block that tunnel. We condemn countries to years of deflation, poverty and emigration with no end in sight. Recovery won’t come to the southern countries until they are free to reissue their own currencies and price their way back into the market.</p><p>
</p><p>Nor can we preach austerity to them unless we practise it ourselves. Imagine how a European summit, with its banquets and motorcycle outriders and armies of hangers on, must look to a public sector worker who faces redundancy because of government cuts. Imagine how taxpayers in our home countries feel when every pound or euro saved in domestic spending is swallowed up by higher contributions to the EU budget.</p><p>
</p><p>My group makes no apologies for being single minded about the single market and we will continue to pursue this agenda of creating a digital single market, further extending services, and reviewing procurement rules to encourage innovation. We will also continue to push for better implementation of existing Single Market rules.</p><p>
</p><p>And of course, opening the Single Market would be pointless unless we also continue to open our markets to the rest of the world – the parts of the world, that is, where the growth still is.</p><p>
</p><p>Many of these actions are for the medium to long term. But there is one action that we could take right here, right now to show businesses our commitment to growth. Surely one of the best ways for the EU to speed up growth is to scrap the Employment and Social Affairs directorate in the commission, and repatriate its responsibilities to national governments. Then we could scrap the Working Time Directive, the Agency Workers’ Directive, the Pregnant Workers’ Directive and the other barriers to actually employing people.</p><p>
</p><p>We can’t create jobs by talking about them, or passing resolutions. In fact, we – we Eurocrats and MEPs – can’t create jobs at all. What we can do is get out of the way and allow entrepreneurs to invent things, make things, sell things. That’s where employment growth comes from. And that’s where social security comes from too: there is no surer antidote to poverty than secure employment.</p><p>
</p><p>When I was a new MEP, we had just signed up to something called the Lisbon Agenda, which was supposed to make Europe the most dynamic, knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010. As Sarah Palin might put it: How’s that working out for you?</p><p>

Martin Callanan: Comments at reception for EU-U.S. Expert Countering Violent Extremism meeting on Pakistan and Pakistani Diaspora Communities,13-02-2012,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,621,"<p>
	</p><p>- On behalf of the ECR group, thank you for being here. Thanks to Saj Karim for organising this event.</p><p>
</p><p>- Saj knows only too well the impact of violent extremism from Pakistan. For those who do not know, Saj spent the evening of Wednesday 26th November 2008 and some of the morning of Thursday also, in the basement of the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai as gunmen murdered innocent people from across the world. Our other colleague Syed Kamall was also just down the road trapped in the Khyber restaurant. We are of course relieved that he and all of our other colleagues from the parliament escaped without any serious injury. </p><p>
</p><p>- The events in Mumbai turned the spotlight onto the issue of violent extremism within Pakistan. Our interest once again peaked when Osama Bin Laden was found in Abbottabad – literally under the noses of the Pakistani Army.</p><p>
</p><p>- But, on a day-to-day basis, are we doing enough to help tackle this dangerous threat to Asia, to Europe and to the World? Should we be asking whether our policies and rhetoric throughout recent history have exacerbated or weakened the level of extremism? Is this something that can be tackled without the 100 percent backing of the Pakistani authorities?</p><p>
</p><p>- We have at our disposal this evening several excellent speakers who will undoubtedly be better qualified than I to answer these questions.</p><p>
</p><p>- But two things stand out to me:</p><p>
</p><p>- Firstly, the EU and USA must stand firm in fighting all forms of violent extremism. Such extremism is not only confined to Pakistan or the Pakistani Diaspora. And it is also important to stress that it transcends religion. Such violence runs contrary to religious teachings; for example, the Quran emphasises peace, non-violence and mutual respect.</p><p>
</p><p>- Violent extremism is a global problem which requires all of the resources on both sides of the Atlantic to work together and stand resolute – both in trying to tackle the causes of radicalisation, and in apprehending and incarcerating those people who mean us harm.</p><p>
</p><p>- Secondly, Pakistan and the UK have long historic ties both within and independently of the Commonwealth. Tomorrow, we will see an example of our common cultural heritage when England is yet again demolished by Pakistan’s formidable bowlers in the Cricket test match! Of course, it is a sign of the problem that this match is taking place in Abu Dhabi, following the 2009 attack in Pakistan on the Sri Lankan cricket team.</p><p>
</p><p>- As Pakistan’s friends, it falls to us to be honest with the Pakistani government. Nobody can deny that Pakistan has been crucial in the so-called ‘War on Terror’. But we must also be aware of the significant destabilising role that the Afghan Taleban is having within the country.</p><p>
</p><p>- Al Qaeda first declared war on all moderate, modern opinion within the Muslim world – an attack on the great majority. It opened a ‘Second Front’ with the West over a decade ago. However, this struggle between the forces of moderation and violent extremism is one that is occuring principally in the Muslim World. We are clear that we will stand shoulder to shoulder with all forces in Pakistan who oppose extremism – for the sake of Pakistan as well as our own.</p><p>
</p><p>- I will be interested to hear from our speakers how they feel we can make the Pakistani government more effective and resolute in weeding out extremism, and how we can encourage a culture of governance that is more stable and based on the rule of law.</p><p>

"Jan Zahradi, MEP: Pre-conditions of good governance (democracy, pluralism, freedom of media, transparency…)",22-06-2011,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,1486,"<p>
	</p><p>As we all know, no good can be done without proper control over the means and actors involved in a process. This applies particularly in the area of trade, where commercial interests may occasionally clash with national ones as well as individual human aspirations. For this reason, it is crucial that trade relations are embedded in a rulebook, which clearly defines, on the one hand, the field of the allowed or possible and, on the other hand, the interdictions. This is also precisely the reason way the ECR Group always insists that rules on trade be adopted as much as possible at the multilateral level because the WTO framework creates the necessary level playing field and common rules to which all actors are subject, while having at their disposal a standard mechanism for dispute settlements should the need arise.</p><p>
</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, today I am speaking to you not only as a the ECR Group Chairman and member of the I NTA and DEVE committees, but also as one of the Members of the European Parliament coming from a “new” Member State. Let me therefore make few remarks from this perspective to start.  Members States of the European Communities, now the European Union, went through an interesting and multifaceted evolution with respect to developing countries, especially in Africa. No need to remind the colonial past, which would fill in an entire lecture. Let me rather remind you of the “Cold War” era, when different forms of African socialism were being established in many African countries. This led them to establish close political and above all economic ties with many countries of the Soviet empire. However, often, these ties were driven by motives of “real politik”, with Soviet states caring more about which side of the Iron Curtain African countries’ sympathies lay rather than any specific developmental incentive.</p><p>
</p><p>The Western politic had the same motivation. No surprise than that many countries of the than European Communities provided scholarships to students from Africa. Europe also focused on exporting to their motherlands technological compounds, helping them to develop their agriculture, their industrial base, and assisting them financially to build-up a free-market economy.</p><p>
</p><p>After 1989 and the collapse of the Iron wall that was followed by a democratic change in Central and Eastern Europe, the European Communities’ focus shifted from Africa to its own closest European borders, where a new market had just emerged. This was even truer for the future “new” EU Member States that abandoned their African markets. Today, the Czech Republic I come from realises 84 % of its exports to the EU and only 16 % outside of it. In comparison, as regards Germany, this ratio is about 66% to the EU and 34% outside of it. It is clear that such a one-sided dependence is not good at all. We became aware of this even more saliently as part of the global crisis, and ongoing eurozone crisis.</p><p>
</p><p>The new EU Member States made a mistake in quitting their previous markets in Africa. By doing so, they also lost a substantial part of their experience with the developing world and contacts therein. I say so as a right-wing politician very well aware of the fact that this retreat from Africa occurred under special circumstances and as part of a broader leaning away from the “socialist doctrine” of the Soviet camp.</p><p>
</p><p>This is also the reason why I sense that we should not be forgetting again Africa and the developing world in general. We should always remind us of the fact that Africa is Europe’s closest geographical neighbour. For this reason, when we think about Africa, we should not be only thinking about humanitarian and development aid. We should also think about trade, and not be ashamed of it because the EU has and will continue having strategic economic and geopolitical interests therein.</p><p>
</p><p>The year 2010 was the “Year of Africa” and we have had the opportunity to look back on the past 50 years of its development since the post-colonial independences. Even if the days of the “African socialism” are bygones, Africa’s development still does not reaches the quality it should have attained, and which I certainly would like it to see.</p><p>
</p><p>It is clear that for developing countries to become mature actors of international trade relations, they need to grow their own domestic institutional structures, which will serve them to define their own priorities in this respect in a fair and accountable manner. Although it is clear, at least to me, that there is no single receipt for good governance nor is it possible to force democracy upon people and nations, because where there is no underlining freedom and the possibility to express free will, there is no “good” governance at all, it seems legitimate that we Europeans encourage our counterparts to analyse and, if they see fit, take inspiration from the EU´s best practices in terms of democratic decision-making and scrutiny.</p><p>
</p><p>Just let’s pause and reflect for a moment upon the improvements in terms of democratic decision-making that occurred since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, which, and this is one of the genuinely good things about it, has granted the European Parliament more power in the area of trade. Parliament as you certainly know is now a co-legislator with Council in the ordinary legislative procedure when it comes to “measures defining the framework for implementing the common commercial policy” (as set out in Article 207(2) TFEU) OLP defined in Art. 294).</p><p>
Moreover, Parliament has the right to say “yes” or “no” to trade agreements as the mandatory consent for trade agreements basically gives it the right of veto (Article 218 (6)(a)(v) TFEU).</p><p>
</p><p>Parliamentary control over trade relations between the EU and third countries is to me a pre-condition of good governance in this domain. Among the many other aspects which also contribute to this, let me point of the following:</p><p>
1) Political pluralism as expressed in the variety of political groups in the EP and their respective underlining ideologies or political thoughts;</p><p>
</p><p>2) Freedom of media, which report back to EU citizens, and broadcast worldwide, information on the advantages, opportunities, and eventual disadvantages that a particular trade agreement may have for the EU businesses and citizens or for those of our trading partner. They also act as a watchdog to denounce mismanagement of EU funds provided to development aid, and last, but not least, raise public awareness about the beneficiaries of EU or WTO trade initiatives for development. The role of Internet and other new media is becoming crucial and should be promoted by all appropriate means.</p><p>
</p><p>3) Transparency, which is needed in terms of access to relevant trade documents such as the negotiation mandates which Council gives to the Commission to negotiate trade agreements on behalf of the EU, to which the EP will ultimately give it not give consent.</p><p>
</p><p>4) Responsibility, which shall never be forgotten! And, without which we would never be able to set the right degree of the precedent aspect to ensure a viable balance between the legitimate right to secrecy to protect key business data, and thus the edge European businesses and industries still have in some export sectors, and the need to know enough to be able to decide in a sensible manner and accept to be accountable for decisions made.</p><p>
</p><p>When I think about my previous experience with various African countries, I really wish they had strong and effective parliaments in place to validate their public policies in general, and the choice of their trading partners in particular. To give you an example from the Democratic Republic of the Congo which I visited last year as part of the 21st ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly that took place in its capital city Kinshasa, I was surprised by the volume and variety of Chinese-made products sold on the local markets. It made me wonder about the reasons that explain China’s success in accessing African markets at the expense of their European competitors.</p><p>
</p><p>My personal opinion is that we should rethink our way to do trade with African countries. More precisely, I think that instead of indulging them with extensive development aid, we should gradually stop providing any kind of it, except for clearly defined humanitarian purposes in response to special emergency cases,  while channelling the money previously earmarked for aid to projects of micro-credit, joint ventures, and last, but not least, public private partnerships with a focus on enhancing their institutional setting in areas such as tax collection, infrastructure building, and education, which is of outmost importance.</p><p>
</p><p>The EU as a highly industrialised trading partner needs new markets to sell on  its industrial goods and advanced technologies and services, while Africa is in need of a technology leap to enter with the right foot in the area of “eco-technology”, which it can best achieve through access to foreign know-how combined with own domestic initiatives. Dynamic EU-African trade relations can, in my view, contribute to both.</p><p>

MEP Evzen Tosenovsky´s speech at the European Nuclear Energy Forum in Prague,25-05-2011,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,739,"<p>
	</p><p>Dear Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.</p><p>
</p><p>A year ago, I addressed the European nuclear energy forum in Bratislava as a European Parliament representative. I spoke of the renaissance in the way that the use of atomic energy is perceived. Since then, the topic of nuclear power plants has now become politicised and the picture is completely different. In the course of the last year, nothing dramatic happened in Europe’s energy sector. Conversely, the Parliament, in cooperation with the Commission, discussed a variety of measures aimed at stabilising the entire sector. Complex documents on the external gas supply procedures were approved without any strong areas of conflict. Similarly, the Parliament discussed the structures of national energy resource mixtures.</p><p>
</p><p>Then in March, an earthquake of high magnitude occurred in Japan and was followed by a devastating tsunami. This event has had a key impact on Europe’s energy discourse.</p><p>
</p><p>The disaster in distant Japan had a large psychological impact on Europe’s perception of energy. As illustrated by the European Parliament’s vote last month on a declaration on nuclear energy, there are almost exactly two opposing camps. None of the seven declarations were approved and this happened only by a small margin of votes.</p><p>
</p><p>The decision to carry out tests on nuclear devices in Europe has certainly provided reassurance to those concerned about the safety of its use. Most MEPs are aware of the complexity and the highly technical nature of these tests. The current mixture of energy resources used within the EU is based on the Lisbon Treaty and also depends on the decision of each member state. This means that the responsibility and the decision on implementation lie with the member state. Similarly, the responsibility for the safety of a nuclear power also lies with the state in which the resource is located.</p><p>
</p><p>In turn, Commissioner Oettinger highlighted to certain concerned MEPs, that no country can dictate to others how these tests should be conducted. Thus, the discussion of the criteria must take place between the country representatives. I think it is necessary to think in advance about the evaluation of the criteria to be adopted, instead of evaluating them only ex post. Any assessment of the terrorist attacks must be a matter for the entire security system of the country, not just one power plant.</p><p>
</p><p>I personally believe that the current arrangement is the correct one, regarding the decision on the composition of the mixture of energy source and the sovereignty of member states in this matter. From a philosophical perspective, Europe is geographically and demographically very different, therefore its decisions are often subject to instantaneous political movements in each country. Efforts to devolve decision-making power to the EU on this matter would place unnecessarily economic weight and would result in the promotion of certain interests. It is certainly very reasonable for the tests to be based on the conclusions of the specialized agencies WENRA and ENSREG. This is exactly how the majority of members of the ITRE Committee approached the problem.</p><p>
</p><p>I am convinced that reasonable reliability checks on nuclear plants will help to reassure the public, and where possible, that the energy debate will once again be sober and realistic in nature. While I know that after the events in Fukushima it will not be easy, it is important to note that in history, disasters have always led to different technological improvements and increased safety equipments and measures. After air-born disasters, which in one second killed more people than any nuclear power disaster, people did not stop flying. Each tragedy led to further improvements on security. Though, of course, each country in Europe must be free to decide on its own approach to the topic of nuclear energy. I hope that short-term political decisions will be replaced by a rational approach. My optimism stems inter alia from the current discussions on the disposal of nuclear waste, which despite a turbulent atmosphere, is going in quite a constructive way.</p><p>
</p><p>In conclusion, I am optimistic that Europe can find a rational approach to the topic of nuclear energy. Energy sources without nuclear contributions would be problematic and its economic weight would be enormous. There is a big question of how additional “sustainable” energy sources can be further connected into the system. In the European Union at the moment is certainly a fundamental discussion on the transmission system and transmission of energy across Europe.</p><p>

Timothy Kirkhope: We must work across the Atlantic on cybersecurity,14-04-2011,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,1404,"<p>
	</p><p>Timothy Kirkhope MEP, Deputy Chairman of the European Conservatives and Reformists group. Keynote Address: Transatlantic Cybersecurity Research Workshop, Hungarian Embassy to the United States</p><p>
</p><p>Speaking at a conference organised by the Hungarian Presidency of the EU, bringing together MEPs, Congressmen and members of civil society from both sides of the Atlantic, Mr Kirkhope said:</p><p>
</p><p>“Introduction</p><p>
</p><p>“Every day 800 million people in the united states and the european union rely on the economy, the technology, the markets and the international relationships facilitated by international cyber networks. The prosperity and safety of both our continents is reliant upon these networks being secure as well as open. However, The anonymous and asymmetric nature of cyberspace means there can be billions of potential sources spread throughout the world which could be a potential threat. Globalisation has brought the US and the EU an invaluable resource, but it has also brought us a formidable and invisible enemy.</p><p>
</p><p>“That is why a trusted, cooperative and effective transatlantic relationship is essential.</p><p>
</p><p>“The U.S. and EU interests are intrinsically linked with countries all over the world, both with our friends and with our enemies. We expand this network further and further everyday in the pursuit of reaching every corner of the world, however, in doing so we put ourselves at even greater risk, the variation for attack, multiplying all the while. It is the ultimate trade off.</p><p>
</p><p>“The ugly truth is that by beginning to legislate in the area of cyber security you are swiftly met with the realisation that you will always be trying to close the door after the horse has bolted.</p><p>
</p><p>“The statistics speak for themselves.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The US Government computer network is hacked millions of times everyday.</p><p>
</p><p>Approximately 9 million Americans have their identity stolen each year.</p><p>
</p><p>The current costs of cyber crime costs large US enterprises 3.8 million dollars a year.</p><p>
</p><p>The cost of cyber crime is 1 trillion dollars worldwide annually.</p><p>
</p><p>It is estimated that one in every 36 emails receives by Government is blocked as malicious.</p><p>
</p><p>The Pentagon’s computer systems are probed 250,000 times an hour, up to six million times per day.</p><p>
</p><p>The European Commission claims that the cost of cybercrime in the EU, at €750 billion annually, vastly exceeds drug trafficking and is equivalent to 1% of global GDP.</p><p>
</p><p>On the black market a cybercriminal can buy a full identity profile for €40.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>“No Government, company or institution is too big or sufficiently protected to not be a potential victim. Google, The European Commission, and the European Government’s have all been recent victims.</p><p>
</p><p>“The breach of the Estonian Government in 2007 highlighted just how difficult it was to implement agreements, and organise a response, on an international level. The attack caused numerous problems; certain Government and banking functions were unable to be carried out. Yet gaining agreement between the NATO Members as to whether Article 5 should be applied in this circumstance was a problem in its own right. Within the scope of a cyber attack, the definition of a hostile act of war was and still remain ambiguous.</p><p>
</p><p>“Both NATO and the European Commission have recently come up with common policy areas, and new proposals, in order to update and renew international cooperation, to provide legal instruments, and cooperate and establish commonalities, but it is still a slow moving progress against a fast paced threat.</p><p>
</p><p>“And while we must of course address the threat posed by a 16 year old in his basement, we must also realise that cyberspace is fast becoming a new theatre of warfare where authoritarian states – led by China – are at best complicit and at worst active in hacking both to track down political opponents and to undermine our defence systems.</p><p>
</p><p>“Therefore, Cyberspace has brought us a multi faceted dilemma in need of a multi faceted solution;</p><p>
</p><p>“Challenges facing international cooperation:</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The definition and commonalities of cyber threats, is dependent upon country, region, and technical definitions.</p><p>
</p><p>There is a constant and unpredictable threat over the lack of control belonging to outside countries, and a resistance to rely on the capabilities of allies.</p><p>
</p><p>Diplomatic efforts on both sides, have to coordinate in areas which are rife with secrecy and the restriction placed upon them involving national security, and intellectual and military competition.</p><p>
</p><p>The abandonment of traditional methods for an ever increasing reliance on modern technology.</p><p>
</p><p>Man power v multiple threats.</p><p>
</p><p>Proportionate and timely international warning and response.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>“Strategies to build on:</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Building systems that can anticipate attack and react accordingly and are compatible in response and capability.</p><p>
</p><p>The cooperation between ENISA (European Network and Information Security Association) and relevant American counterparts.</p><p>
</p><p>Regular transatlantic working Groups, on emerging technologies, and risk assessments on current systems and sharing of best practice.</p><p>
</p><p>Repeated testing of our own systems. Continued assessment of performance and failure.</p><p>
</p><p>The promotion and protection of intellectual property.</p><p>
</p><p>Using the internet and social networks in order to educate and illustrate the risks.</p><p>
</p><p>Consistent dialogue between Governments, business, investors, consumers and the industry.</p><p>
</p><p>Better Early Warning System amongst international partners.</p><p>
</p><p>Increasing and coordinating penalties for those who build, use and sell tools and software designed to carry out cyber attacks.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>“We as international partners must bring our shared economies and marketplaces to bear as tools against the threat we face. We need to work on encouraging the production of software and services which are appealing to the consumer and economically desirable. Government’s must work domestically and internationally to achieve this in order to make investment attractive to the manufacturers, and purchasing desirable to the consumers. The support for innovation and the free market has to be there.</p><p>
</p><p>This method of engaging the average consumer and company with security is essential. It is widely acknowledged that the perceived threat is less than the actual threat. It is essential that we all have the knowledge, the theory and the motivation to apply security to our daily cyberspace use. Educating through awareness not fear is all part of this process.</p><p>
</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>
</p><p>“There has of course been previous international efforts, such as the Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime in 2001, a Convention still not ratified by all countries, as well as recent proposals from NATO and the European Commission and the U.S. Administration. Yet despite the level of threat increasing, there is not a single international agreement on cyber security, even between great allies like the U.S. and the E.U.</p><p>
</p><p>“A study by the ENISA concluded that European countries differed greatly in how they were prepared to deal with cybercrime and cyber attacks. The reality is that not all EU countries can agree how best to cooperate and take on the problem, it is therefore, easy to understand that this is an issue not easily negotiated and concluded between the EU and the US.</p><p>
</p><p>“We are all well practiced in the difficulties of legislating in the area of security, and data with an international dimension. Yet we must keep talking, debating, and negotiating.</p><p>
</p><p>“A knife can be used to feed yourself, or it can be used to cause another harm. We must legislate in a way which acknowledges that cyberspace is an incredible tool of freedom and learning, whilst acknowledging it can also be used as a tool of destruction. We must find that right balance.</p><p>
</p><p>“The U.S is our greatest ally.</p><p>
</p><p>“Transatlantic cooperation in the field of cybercrime would be another invaluable tool in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, along with PNR and TFTP.</p><p>
</p><p>“It is essential that we find the common ground needed to achieve this, the common ground which is undoubtedly there if we look. We must focus on excellent cooperation and communication rather than harmonisation. This should be a debate of politicians not lawyers.</p><p>
</p><p>“Both the U.S. and the EU face the same debates, privacy versus accountability, society versus cyberspace, personal responsibility versus government enforcement.</p><p>
</p><p>“Our two systems may be different but our aims are the same, to reconcile the protection of our citizens and our territories, whilst preserving control of our personal information and our personal rights. We both have these tools, one may be protected in a constitution, and one may be protected in a charter of Rights, but those rights are there, written and preserved and there to guide us in our work.</p><p>
</p><p>“What is sure, is that neither the European Union or the United States can afford to look inwards, instead we must both look outward towards our trusted transatlantic partners to work together and find solutions.”</p><p>

Zahradil: EU response to a crisis should not be ‘more Europe’,05-04-2011,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,365,"<p>
	</p><p>ECR President Jan Zahradil speaking during a debate in the European Parliament on the March European Council:</p><p>
</p><p>“Mr President, the most important issue at the last European Council was the economy and stability of the Euro area.</p><p>
</p><p>“In my group, most of the ECR MEPs come from countries outside the Euro zone and the majority of our members are from countries that did not join the pact for the Euro.</p><p>
</p><p>“But that does not mean we want the Euro area to fail, on the contrary. And we want a stable and prosperous EU, including in the Euro area. But we also want the EU to be flexible and relevant to the needs of the 21 century.</p><p>
</p><p>“Where we have common goals, we will support the measures taken. National governments all have a duty to reduce debt, restructure public spending and embark on fiscal reforms. It is right that we take steps to restore financial discipline.</p><p>
</p><p>“So what is wrong? Unfortunately, behind all this is a hidden agenda. It is an attempt to use this crisis to further shift powers. It is an attempt to further progress fiscal and tax harmonisation. Such harmonisation is the first step towards the creation of a fiscal union. And such a union is the first step towards full political union.</p><p>
</p><p>“We say ‘no’ to such a union, and ‘no’ to the attempted destruction of tax competition within the EU.</p><p>
</p><p>“I’ve been here since 2004 and whenever there are any difficulties, I hear a single phrase: we need more Europe, more of the Community method. NO, we do not need it. Trying to fix everything at the EU level plunges us into difficulties, and how are these then resolved? With more action at the EU level!</p><p>
</p><p>“Finally, we should understand that European integration has reached its limits. A clear example can be seen in our so-called common foreign policy. When something important happens, do we show unity? The last example – Libya – saw national leaders setting the tone, not the EU.</p><p>
</p><p>“We simply can not live forever under a 50-year-old federalist vision of European integration. The paradigm has changed and the sooner everyone in this parliament understands that, the better for us all.”</p><p>

Valdemar Tomaševski: Minority Rights,08-03-2011,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,923,"<p>
	</p><p>The topic of today’s session is widely spread in Lithuania despite the fact that in most member states the problems of national minorities in general do not exist as they were simply solved. The States of West democracy hammered out two basic documents regulating the rights of national minorities, namely the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. </p><p>
</p><p>The road was already put ahead for the states of central-eastern Europe, thus they did not need to discover anything but just to approve the documents and implement them into live. Moreover, after signing the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in 2000 Lithuania had to ratify it as well. It seemed that all the problems of national minorities had to disappear from the docket of problems until that time. Unfortunately, today at the end of 2009 the problems not only did not diminish, but even the regress was noticed in the rights that had been acquired in 20 century.</p><p>
</p><p>The fact that in the meantime in 2004 Lithuania joined the European Union should be mentioned as crucial as well. Such a paradoxical situation was difficult to predict even for a person of extraordinary political intuition. Unfortunately, the truth is that today, as a national minority in Lithuania, we have less rights in comparison to the period of the first years of  independency of Lithuania, which was gained in 1991. I will present some examples to prove my words.</p><p>
</p><p>In 1991, under the amendments of Lithuanian Law on National Minorities the minorities obtained the right to use their vernacular language alongside the state language in public life in the places of their compact concentrations. In some districts and communes bilingual (usually in the state language Lithuanian and in Polish) street name plates, informative inscriptions appeared. Such solution was really logical. After all, the Polish national minority in two districts of Vilnius and more than 40 communes constitutes 60-90% of all the inhabitants.</p><p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the Lithuanian politicians opposite to such solution ignoring the above mentioned Lithuanian law, Framework Convention, and the Treaty of Accession, initiated a number of legal actions demanding the removal of bilingual inscriptions in Vilnius districts in 2008. It may seem strange, but the Supreme Administrative Court of the Republic of Lithuania satisfied the unfavourable to national minorities’ demands of the politicians and gave a ruling ordering to remove the bilingual plates.</p><p>
</p><p>Local communities are not able to reconcile with it, people do not allow to remove the inscriptions from their houses. Authorities drew the state administration and even bailiffs into the conflict, who threatening with fines force to remove the tables. The situation cannot be called differently than scandalous. In the opinion of local inhabitants the situation is just lawless. It is extremely difficult to dispute such opinion, people do not understand why after our accession to the European Union in 2004 their rights as minorities are suddenly depleted. Such situation does not add any authority to the European Union. Thus, this misunderstanding should be resolved as soon as possible.</p><p>
</p><p>There is another topic crucial for national minorities. Namely, the education system. Unfortunately, a clear regression is noted in this sphere as well. Here is an example of the last minute – funding for schools of national minorities has been reduced by 5 percent this year. A year ago, the minimal number of students in the classes of national minorities schools has been dramatically increased, which can lead to the closure of half of the schools of national minorities. Even earlier, the compulsory examination of the vernacular language was liquidated in the schools of national minorities. In Lithuanian government, despite the national minority protests, the projects to introduce a compulsory teaching of half or even more subjects in the schools of national minorities in the language other than vernacular are in progress.</p><p>
</p><p>A third example of a clear regress in the rights of national minorities is the hampering of the minority participation in political life. And however there are no standards concerning the application of the electoral threshold for ethnic minorities in Europe, it should be noted that the introduction of such a threshold for the national minority organizations in 1996 was a scheduled step intended to weaken the minority organisations. For example, in 1992 in already independent Lithuania there was no threshold for national minorities and the Association of Poles in Lithuania (APL), registered in the nationwide list, gained 2.1% and two mandates as a result. Two more mandates were gained in the single mandate constituencies.</p><p>
</p><p>The threshold was introduced in 1996 and a list of EAPL received 3 percent of votes but gained no mandates at all. In 2008 it gained 4.8% and the electoral threshold deprived it of 5 seats. EAPL gained only three seats in single-mandate constituencies. The constituencies were formed in a particular way in order to impede the victory of the representatives of national minorities in the constituencies. Thus part of the Vilnius, Šalčininkai districts where Poles constitute even 80 percent of all voters, were annexed to neighbouring districts, where Poles constitute only a small amount of the residents. That is how it looks in practice – a national minority candidate in an electoral constituency of e.g. Varėna-Eišiškės may gain 80 percent of votes in ¼ of the constituency, while in a whole constituency he is doomed to failure.</p><p>
</p><p>We have to clearly and firmly speak about the inappropriate attitude towards national minorities, as such problems should not exist in the European Union. I sincerely hope that today’s session will not only be helpful in exposure of these problems but also in their solution</p><p>

"Speech to enlarged Conference of Presidents with European Council President Van Rompuy, by Timothy Kirkhope MEP",08-02-2011,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,554,"<p>
	</p><p>Freedom is a value shared across this house and for the ECR Group it is one of our most important principles. We believe the maximisation of individual freedom in society with a restricted state and low taxes is the best way to secure the social, economic and political objectives we all seek.</p><p>
</p><p>This is why we welcome developments in Tunisia – which the British Foreign Secretary is visiting today – in Egypt and across the Arab world, and we support the declaration adopted by the European Council last Friday.</p><p>
</p><p>It is a myth perpetrated by those who wish to control their fellow citizens that democracy is incompatible with Islamic faith or inconsistent with Arab culture. Recent events have demonstrated that the peoples of the Arab world have the same desire for freedom and democracy as elsewhere. Repression has stifled economic development – and people in north Africa and much of the middle east have been held down, and held back. Economic progress has been slow, characterised by low growth and high unemployment – a key factor in the recent upheaval. This has made some fall for the appeal of more violent and extremist groups. But if freedom and economic development can be achieved, the vast majority will never take that path.</p><p>
</p><p>We therefore support the process of transition in Egypt. We should however record that President Mubarak has been a great Egyptian patriot, and a friend of Europe and America. By pursuing peace with Israel he has no doubt saved lives. But we can not be blind to the authoritarian nature of his regime. The time has come for change.</p><p>
</p><p>We know from our experiences here in Europe, that democracy has its best chance of success if it can build on a functioning state transformed by careful steps to meet the hopes of the people. And we know too from the revolution in Iran that a brief flicker of freedom can be cruelly snuffed out by one authoritarian regime snatching power from another.</p><p>
</p><p>So careful progress is our hope for the people of Egypt, the middle east, and beyond, including Belarus whose citizens have tragically once again be denied the chance of a free and fair election. And as we support freedom abroad, so we support it at home.</p><p>
</p><p>We welcome the progress made in the European Council to extend the principles of economic freedom enshrined in the single market to the key area of innovation. The creation of a “genuine single market for knowledge, research and innovation” by means of the European Research Area deserves support, as does the Digital Single Market; also an integrated energy market to promote competition and ensure energy security. We must not neglect these key reforms to build a sustainable competitive economy. But let me add a word of caution. It is right to sweep away artificial barriers to trade, research and innovation, but we must resist the temptation to intervene too forcefully in the market by trying to pick winners or impose regulations.</p><p>
</p><p>In this field, as in so many others, governments need to establish the right legal and policy frameworks, provide the right climate and incentives for investment, and then allow businesses, entrepreneurs, inventors and scientists to extend the boundaries of technology and innovation. It is economic freedom, not government intervention, that will open the door to our future prosperity.</p><p>

"Speaking to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, ECR Deputy Chairman and leader of the UK Conservatives in the European Parliament, Timothy Kirkhope MEP, said:",06-10-2010,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,911,"<p>
	</p><p>Speaking to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, ECR Deputy Chairman and leader of the UK Conservatives in the European Parliament, Timothy Kirkhope MEP, said:</p><p>
</p><p>Our new group, the European Conservatives and Reformists, is little more than twelve months old but we can already report on a year of real achievement. David Cameron’s vision of a new political force in European politics is being realised: a movement for reform offering a new vibrant vision of a decentralised, free market Europe respecting the rights of its member states.</p><p>
</p><p>We are now setting a new agenda:</p><p>
•       by leading the campaign to end Parliament’s meetings in Strasbourg;</p><p>
•       by fighting additional burdens of red tape and over-regulation on British businesses;</p><p>
•       by ensuring the City of London get a fair deal in the financial services package;</p><p>
•       by winning arguments against waste and fighting to control the EU budget;</p><p>
And now of course the work of our new group has been reinforced by our new government in the UK. Reform in Europe is gathering momentum. And not before time. It is overdue and desperately needed to meet the global challenges we face.</p><p>
</p><p>For three hundred years, the most economically powerful nations were also the most liberal – countries committed to the rule of law, the rights of individuals, constitutional government and, ultimately, to democracy itself. Together time and again, we were able to defeat the revolutionary and totalitarian threats we faced.</p><p>
</p><p>But things have changed.</p><p>
</p><p>As recently as 1980 the West had over one half of global GDP. Soon it will approach one third – a downward trend that will continue well into this century.</p><p>
</p><p>The reality is that a new kind of state-driven capitalist system in countries like China and Russia now poses a massive challenge.</p><p>
And we also face the ever present danger of those who operate outside the law and the control of any state – pursuing their authoritarian ambitions in the name of religion though terror.</p><p>
</p><p>So we must work towards a world were the benefits of economic growth are shared, but go hand in hand with democratic development.</p><p>
</p><p>What we need is a re-invigorated transatlantic alliance, a renewed Commonwealth, and a re-focused European Union.</p><p>
</p><p>And that is what the European Conservative and Reformist Group is all about: Eurorealism.</p><p>
Your Conservative MEPs are dedicated to this goal and I am proud of the work they have accomplished on your behalf. The ECR has established itself as a pivotal force in the European Parliament and in the other institutions of the European Union. We alone offer a clear message and a coherent programme of reform. And our impact is growing by the day. Our role has been crucial in a range of decisions from the election of the President of the Commission to the development of new initiatives for the internal market.</p><p>
</p><p>Of course we cannot do this alone.</p><p>
</p><p>Coalition-building may be relatively new to all of us today in Britain but it is of course a fact of life in the European Parliament.</p><p>
</p><p>By having clear objectives, a strong voice and a willingness to cooperate, we are winning arguments and rallying support from elsewhere in the Parliament. We have already broken the mould of European politics. We can now rally believers in the free-market across the centre and right of the Parliament to promote vital economic reform.</p><p>
</p><p>The work we are doing in Brussels offers the way forward for Europe that it has so far lacked. We are in the vanguard of an exciting fresh start after literally years of institutional wrangling.</p><p>
</p><p>As well as having experience of coalition-building, we also have experience of dealing every day with backward-looking, old-fashioned socialists with a dangerous belief in an over-powerful role for the state, who are beholden to the vested interests of the public sector and to unrealistic and unreasonable trade unions. Sounds familiar doesn’t it? Ed Miliband would feel quite at home.</p><p>
</p><p>And talking of the Milibands – poor David…. losing to your younger brother….having to step aside from the front bench…Ladies and Gentlemen – that’s got to be the first time a politician has quit to spend less time with his family.</p><p>
</p><p>Ladies & Gentlemen, old-style socialism is back with a vengeance here and across the whole continent. It poses a threat to our economic and political future and so we cannot and must not stand aside: we must ensure that we are equal to the task of defeating it once and for all.</p><p>
******************************</p><p>
</p><p>At last Britain now has again in William Hague a Foreign Secretary respected throughout the world. Ably supported by David Lidington, counterparts across Europe know that we are open to cooperation when it makes sense but will remain firm in the defence of British interests and resolute in defending our political principles.</p><p>
</p><p>And at European summits, David Cameron is transforming the debate there as he has transformed it here – taking the lead:</p><p>
-       on sorting out public finances and building a sustainable economy;</p><p>
-       on promoting international development and the global environment; and</p><p>
-       on expanding economic opportunity and global trade.</p><p>
</p><p>Our Group, our Conservative MEPs, inspired by his vision and beliefs – will support him all the way.</p><p>
</p><p>******************************</p><p>
</p><p>We face enormous challenges in Britain, in Europe, and across the globe. But with commitment and confidence, this can be a time of opportunity – a time to restore our country’s fortunes at home and to re-assert its values throughout the world.</p><p>
</p><p>Ladies & Gentlemen – in Europe and the World, British leadership, Conservative Leadership, is back.</p><p>

Timothy Kirkhope speech at Open Europe debate,17-03-2010,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,1696,"<p>
	</p><p>The Priorities the next UK government should have in Europe</p><p>
</p><p>Ladies & Gentlemen,</p><p>
</p><p>Britain needs a government which can be trusted to promote Britain’s national interests in the European Union by advancing its ideas clearly and firmly, and engaging constructively with our fellow members to develop the kind of Europe the public wants: a European Union which can earn their respect and merit their confidence.</p><p>
</p><p>*****</p><p>
</p><p>The fact is that during the 13 years of this government, public support for our membership of the European Union has fallen, it is lower now then when they took office. That is a sad indictment of their record in Europe. For all the sound-bites and soft words, the Government hasn’t delivered in Europe and the public knows it.</p><p>
</p><p>The Government simply hasn’t offered clear or consistent leadership:</p><p>
</p><p>- To the British public they pledged to defend the British rebate and to get reform in Europe, whilst in Brussels they sacrificed part of the rebate in return for the offer of a ‘review’ of the CAP – a very expensive review.</p><p>
</p><p>- In Brussels time and again they have bent over backwards to accommodate the demands of other members to prove they are ‘good Europeans’, whilst indulging in macho posturing in the British media, puffing up the strength of their negotiating positions and the importance of their so-called ‘red lines’.</p><p>
</p><p>- They agreed enthusiastically to sign up to the Lisbon Treaty but, rather than have the courage of his supposed convictions, the British Prime Minister invented excuses so he could arrive late in order to miss the official signing ceremony, and then he told us it didn’t really matter as the Treaty was just a tidying up exercise and that most of the substantial changes didn’t really apply to us anyway.</p><p>
</p><p>- And, in the ultimate betrayal, the Government told the British people they would have a chance to vote in a referendum on the Constitution and then, when such referendums proved difficult to win, they agreed with the other member states to re-package the Constitution as the Lisbon Treaty to avoid the need for a vote. They had the power and opportunity to call a referendum and by failing to honour their promise on the pretext of a shabby re-branding exercise, a precious opportunity was lost forever when the treaty was finally ratified.</p><p>
</p><p>No wonder the public no longer trusts Labour on Europe. And nor do our European allies. They can see through a government which tries to be euro-sceptic in the Sun newspaper but is predominantly euro-federalist in Brussels.</p><p>
</p><p>What Britain now needs is to earn the respect of our European partners by engaging constructively in the debate with a consistent approach. Under a Conservative Government, our partners may not always like what we have to say but at least they will always be able to trust what we say.</p><p>
</p><p>*****</p><p>
</p><p>We do not propose to re-launch yet another tedious institutional debate. Europe has wasted enough time on institutional wrangling over recent years. Instead we want Europe to focus on the real issues that matter to people. We will nonetheless put in place certain safeguards for the future and pursue measures to mitigate the worst aspects of the Lisbon Treaty.</p><p>
</p><p>At home,</p><p>
</p><p>- we will make all future treaty changes which include any transfer of powers to the European Union subject to a referendum.</p><p>
</p><p>- We will ensure that none of the so-called ‘ratchet’ clauses in the Treaty which could result in the abolition of vetoes and the transfer of powers could be invoked without parliamentary approval.</p><p>
</p><p>- And we share the view of the German Federal Constitutional Court that any delegation of powers to the European Union must be in accordance with constitutions of the sovereign member states from which it derives its authority to act and that, as a consequence, the rights of domestic democratic institutions must be respected. So we will enact a Sovereignty Bill so that this principle can be upheld in the context of our own constitutional arrangements.</p><p>
In Europe,</p><p>
</p><p>- we will seek a full opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental Rights – which strayed far beyond a simple statement of core rights and became a wish-list for many different special interests.</p><p>
</p><p>- We will defend the integrity and independence of our Criminal Justice System through an additional protocol.</p><p>
</p><p>- And we will assert the principle of subsidiarity in key areas of social and employment legislation we believe are damaging to the British economy.</p><p>
</p><p>During the course of the life-time of the next government, there will be sufficient opportunities to realize these objectives: minor treaties are enacted for enlargements, changes to the size of the European Parliament, and so forth which could all be used as vehicles for the some of the amendments we seek.</p><p>
*****</p><p>
</p><p>But beyond this package, an incoming Conservative government will have an ambitious programme for European reform.</p><p>
</p><p>The European Union has an important part to play in supporting economic recovery. The European Commission has just published its Agenda 2020 initiative for driving forward the European economy. There is much in this we would support. We want to develop the internal market further, remove remaining barriers to trade.</p><p>
</p><p>Europe is a vital player in reaching a sensible and balanced package of measures in managing the challenge of climate change.</p><p>
</p><p>Within the Union itself over the next few years key policies will be subject to scrutiny and must be reformed: a new budget in the medium-term framework from 2014 has to be agreed, as will policies on agriculture, regional policy, research, and fisheries. There is a lot at stake.</p><p>
</p><p>*****</p><p>
</p><p>It is because we want to reinforce this drive for reform that  last year we launched our European Conservatives and Reformists Group in the European Parliament. We seek to build:</p><p>
</p><p>- a Europe which respects the rights of its member states and the diversity of its peoples;</p><p>
</p><p>- a Europe which is committed to government with a light touch where the burdens of taxation and regulation are minimised;</p><p>
</p><p>- a Europe which is firm in its support for the transatlantic alliance.</p><p>
</p><p>We want a more open and transparent European Union which acts only where it can add value in a proportionate and effective way.</p><p>
</p><p>We may not be one of the two biggest groups in the European Parliament. But even the biggest of the seven groups in the Parliament only has about one third of its members. Everything has to be negotiated – every vote, every report, every appointment. We are playing our full part in these negotiations. Indeed now that we are free to articulate our vision for Europe and offer our proposals for reform with clarity and vigour, we are able maximise our impact on the Parliament’s work.</p><p>
</p><p>It is simply not the case that ‘influence’ is dependent on being part of a big group.</p><p>
</p><p>Let me give an example from just last week. The Socialist Group called for all US nuclear missiles to be removed from Europe – regardless of any political, military or strategic arguments. And its Labour members? Well, they split three ways!  The majority were opposed to the Socialist Group amendment but they were powerless to stop it. Powerless – so much for all their talk about ‘influence’. On a question of such importance they were left on the sidelines, most of them quietly abstaining in the hope no-one would notice.</p><p>
</p><p>Being part of a big group is not a free ticket to influence. As everyone who really understands the European Parliament appreciates, you influence decisions by the strength and consistency of your message, by having a seat at the table, and by building networks of influence. So let me ask three key questions:</p><p>
</p><p>- Where are Labour in the Parliament’s governing body, the Conference of Presidents? They are never there. As Deputy Leader of our Group I frequently represent it at the Conference.</p><p>
</p><p>- Where are Labour in the crucial meetings of rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, the people responsible for drafting reports? Labour are only there if they are lucky. Conservative members, as the biggest delegation in our new group, are present more often than not.</p><p>
</p><p>- How strong is the influence of Labour members with the Commission? After being dragged along by their Socialist allies in a doomed attempt to unseat the President of Commission, Mr Barroso – an initiative which failed largely thanks to the decisive votes of our Group – they are not regarded as natural partners of the new Commission either. We, on the other hand, are well connected to the Commission at the most senior levels.</p><p>
*****</p><p>
</p><p>Our opponents, in the face of this reality, have tried with increasing desperation to smear our members and you heard more of that tonight – despite the all the evidence – by distorting and twisting comments, often comments they themselves know cannot be substantiated.</p><p>
</p><p>For example, in a recent Labour leaflet attacking the ECR, the text consists largely of accusations covered by the phrase ‘it is said that’, or ‘allegedly’, or ‘reportedly’ – a word used no less than 14 times!</p><p>
</p><p>But endlessly re-cycling a Labour Party press release does not make for a coherent or credible response.</p><p>
</p><p>And, more worryingly, it is damaging our relationships with some of our partners particularly in the newer Member States</p><p>
</p><p>By all means attack us for our beliefs, for our policies, or for our objectives. But such smears should have no part to play in our politics.</p><p>
</p><p>It seems that Labour, in their increasing desperation, have resorted to such tactics.</p><p>
</p><p>Frankly, it is pathetic – even tragic.</p><p>
*****</p><p>
</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen, the priorities for an incoming Conservative Government are to minimise any possible damage arising from the Lisbon Treaty and to work with our partners in driving forward a credible reform agenda:</p><p>
</p><p>- We need a European Union which delivers where the British people and indeed all the peoples of Europe expect it to act: in building a dynamic economy, in dealing with climate change, and in promoting global trade;</p><p>
</p><p>- a European Union which embraces reform of key policy areas such as agriculture and fisheries.</p><p>
</p><p>- a European Union which delivers value for money, respecting the rights of its member states.</p><p>
</p><p>It is an ambitious agenda but success is vitally important in the interests of the British people and indeed of the whole of Europe.</p><p>
</p><p>END</p><p>

Deputy Leader of ECR Group Timothy Kirkhope’s key note speech at PiS conference in Poznan,07-03-2010,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,1433,"<p>
	</p><p>I am delighted to be with you today. It is testament to the deepening relationship between both our parties: the UK Conservative Party, the oldest one in Europe and a party of freedom and democracy, with the Law and Justice Party of Poland which is a beacon for that same belief in freedom and democracy here in your country.</p><p>
</p><p>Working closely together and demonstrating that the creation of our new group in the European Parliament is not a short-term expedient but a long-term project – it is an alliance being built to endure – building on the traditions of both our proud nations.</p><p>
</p><p>I want to put on record my personal appreciation and the appreciation of my party for the efforts of Michal Kaminski, Chairman, and Adam Bielan, the Vice Chairman, in the process of creating the Group. And I am grateful to Professor Legutko for the excellent cooperation between our two parties in the work of the Group.</p><p>
</p><p>I am also delighted to be sharing this session with Mirek Topolanek, one of the key architects of our group and the host in Prague of the highly successful summit which led to the drafting of the founding Declaration of Principles. It paved the way for the leaders of our parties to reinforced them in the summit in Warsaw last May.</p><p>
</p><p>And may I congratulate Chairman Czazynski on his success with this conference and in the Party, and the Chairman of the Georgian Parliament, David Badrazda.</p><p>
</p><p>I am confident that the relationships between Law and Justice, the ODS, the Conservative Party and our allies will grow ever stronger in the years ahead.</p><p>
</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a new force and significant force in European politics.</p><p>
</p><p>The Group of European Conservatives and Reformists has been established to give a voice to all those who felt the old groups in Brussels were out of touch and out of control. Overly enthusiastic about the European Union, and blind to its faults, they were so obsessed by institutional wrangling, they had lost sight of the real concerns of ordinary people.</p><p>
</p><p>Our vision of Europe is different.</p><p>
</p><p>We share the belief that it is right that the nations of Europe come together in a common framework based on agreed institutions and a commitment to the rule of law.</p><p>
</p><p>But we want a European Union where all member states, whether big or small, old or new, rich or poor, north or south, east or west are valued and appreciated equally.</p><p>
</p><p>We want a European Union which respects the rights of its member states and focuses on acting where it can genuinely deliver added value but not needlessly or too much.</p><p>
</p><p>We want a Europe in tune with the daily concerns of its peoples – a Europe which reflects their values, appreciates their cultural inheritance and traditions, and believes in individual freedom.</p><p>
</p><p>The European Union we want supports the market economy as the best way to deliver value and efficiency, based on the simple principle that a commitment to low taxes and light regulation maximises individual freedoms.</p><p>
</p><p>But we know that reforming Europe is not easy. Old habits die hard. But it is a noble objective worth fighting for and I believe our group has already started to make an impact.</p><p>
</p><p>Without our support, José Manual Barroso would no longer be President of the European Commission – he would have been ousted by the socialists. He came to a meeting of the ECR – the first meeting he attended of any political group – took our questions and listened to our concerns.  On the basis of what we heard in response, we gave him our support.</p><p>
</p><p>No party has a majority in the European Parliament. Every issue is subject to negotiation. The left can be outvoted if the groups in the centre and centre-right come together. In these discussions, our position has proved decisive – we are a pivotal player in the parliament.</p><p>
</p><p>To maximise our influence we have established positive working relationships with the leaders of other groups, and other institutions. They know that we are a responsible group in the European Parliament with whom they can do business. Our support cannot be taken for granted but it is understood that we are committed to negotiating seriously and effectively to advance our objectives.</p><p>
</p><p>Our members are well-placed to do so. We have the Chairmanship of the important Internal Market Committee in Parliament – and we have MEPs in key posts in committees and in the Conference of Presidents.</p><p>
</p><p>We must also win more electoral success for the ECR parties during the course of the year ahead. We wish you and President Lech Kaczyński well for your election later this year. And, Mirek, we very much hope you will be returned to office in May. In the United Kingdom we hope we will be able to set a trend by seeing David Cameron elected Prime Minister under a new Conservative Government, possibly in early May.</p><p>
</p><p>Given the scale of the challenges ahead of us, the expansion of our Group’s influence is vitally important.</p><p>
</p><p>Our first priority is making sure the European Union plays a constructive part in Europe’s economic recovery.</p><p>
</p><p>Governments do not create jobs – successful businesses and dynamic entrepreneurs do that – but governments do have a role to play in creating the conditions in which they can thrive.</p><p>
</p><p>We want the European Union to develop and extend the internal market. We want increased competition, lighter regulation, and more open global markets. Opening up opportunities for businesses to expand will help stimulate economic growth.</p><p>
</p><p>For these reasons we support the thrust of the Agenda 2020 initiative and your own 2020 ambitions. But we will remain vigilant to ensure that this initiative does not serve merely as an excuse to centralise more power in Brussels. Member states must themselves embrace the aspirations of the initiative if it is to avoid the fate of the Lisbon Strategy which first lost momentum and then petered out.</p><p>
</p><p>We also face a key challenge during the course of this century: the rise of authoritarian capitalism.</p><p>
</p><p>For three centuries the cause of freedom has been taken forward by nations with relative economic superiority.</p><p>
</p><p>This era may be coming to a close.</p><p>
</p><p>We do not fear fair competition in global markets for goods and commodities. But we should fear countries that use economic power as a political weapon. In Europe, for example, we are vulnerable to energy suppliers who do not share our values. Our energy security is now at stake – and it is hardly reassuring to see a former German Chancellor signed up to work for Russian interests including the narrow and selfish approach to other European Countries.</p><p>
</p><p>We hope of course that trade, free markets, better education, rising living standards and the digital age will all help propel these nations forward to a democratic future.</p><p>
</p><p>But our hopes for the future are balanced by our appreciation of the risks we face today.</p><p>
</p><p>This is why for the ECR, the transatlantic alliance is as important as ever. If the world in the 21st century is to be multi-polar, we must reject the idea of those on the left who believe that Europe and the United States form two separate poles. I have just returned from Washington where I was on my second visit in a fortnight, the first being with Michal Kaminski and Adam Bielan – visits which have put the ECR in a unique position of respect by the major players in the USA and demonstrate the importance of the transatlantic alliance.</p><p>
</p><p>We believe that all the nations who are philosophically part of the ‘west’ should stand together as one pole in our common defence. It is a very dangerous world. The expression of this unity is and must remain NATO which should be strengthened and expanded. Nations across the globe who share our values should be associated with its work.</p><p>
</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen, we have embarked on a great and historic mission: to build a new centre-right force in European politics and a broad conservative movement across our continent. We will work tirelessly to reform the European Union so that it is in step with the beliefs and values of our peoples and works to serve the needs of its member states – a Union which is more open, transparent, democratic and effective. The Group of European Conservatives and Reformists has made a very positive start, and I and the British Conservative Party look forward to developing our ties with Law and Justice now in and in the future as we take this great movement forward.</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your invitation and attention today.</p><p>

Mirek Topolank at he PiS conference in Poznan: We are ready to defend real european values,07-03-2010,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,1030,"<p>
	</p><p>“Greetings to you all, friends, allies, greetings to you brothers!</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your invitation to your congress. Both of our countries await important elections, our parliamentary and your presidential election. It is good that we have been able to make time for each other during this hectic period.</p><p>
</p><p>I am pleased that our partner is the Právo a Spravedlnost (Law and Justice). You are a reliable partner. You are a brave partner.</p><p>
</p><p>Now, please allow me to continue in Czech.”</p><p>
</p><p>Who would just a few years ago believe that we will manage to establish a new strong, reform group in the European Parliament? Nevertheless, we managed to achieve this fantastic thing last year. We are here and nobody can turn us away!</p><p>
</p><p>We are here and we are ready to defend our values together. We are ready to defend freedom. We are ready to defend ourselves against Euro Federalists. We are ready to defend common sense against the Euro-sense. We are ready to defend citizens against bureaucracy. We are ready to defend our conservative view of the world. We are ready, we have the will and the strength to demand changes, which will bring a fresh breeze into the European Union!</p><p>
</p><p>We are the fifth strongest group in the European Parliament. Is that not enough for us? Surely it is not enough, because we want to achieve more, as we know we have what it takes for more. But it is not at all little, when we realise what tremendous friction, what a negative campaign preceded the establishment of our faction. Several Members of the European Parliament were discouraged. Many did not have the courage.  They did not have the proverbial Polish audacity. But we had it. We had the courage to openly face rigid federalisation and forced integration. We were the first to say NO out loud! We were the first, but surely not the last!</p><p>
I am certain that others will follow us. And even thanks to how well and how actively our group works. Its Chairman, its driving force, its spirit, is your significant member and my personal friend. Michal Kaminski. Without him, we would not be this far today. Michal, thanks! Likewise, I cannot forget to mention the work of the Vice-Chairman of the group Adam Biealan.</p><p>
</p><p>We have proven our rights to existence. And that is not at all insignificant in the grinding room of European politics. It is not at all insignificant at a time, when fear of differing opinions is spreading across Europe. When the main political forces and media are paving the argument that freedom is an obstacle in progress. That freedom must step aside to the identified need. That the centre is omniscient and the peripheries have to adjust to it. Yes, once again we hear those words! Does that not remind you of something? Is it not possible to hear an echo of an unpleasant déjà vu especially for our countries?</p><p>
</p><p>We refuse to come to terms with that. We cannot accept that. Are we to accept that a so-called new Europe will, on the one hand, want to guarantee group and social rights of third, fourth, fifth generation, and on the other hand, deny the rights to a Christian worldview? Should we come to terms with the fact that the EU Commissioner can simply become a Communist, but cannot become a deeply religious Catholic? We will not accept that!</p><p>
</p><p>Should we come to terms with the fact that Brussels dictates what we should plant and where, and that it supports farmers from old countries at the expense of new countries? Should we accept that Brussels will impose a unified tax on us? Should we accept that Brussels will interfere in the education of our children? That it will force us to give up our traditional family values? We will not accept that!</p><p>
</p><p>Should we come to terms with the fact that, on one hand, the European Union has mentioned the ambition to unify our lives, but on the other hand, it is not able to proceed in unity, there, where it is necessary and sensible? That we are not capable of jointly and strongly supporting common defence and Euro-Atlantic ties? That it still has not come to an agreement on joint energy policy? That it is not tough enough in promoting liberalisation of the internal market? We will not accept that!</p><p>
</p><p>We are the conscious of the European Union. We will remind it of what values it was built on. We do not need tonnes of paper like European bureaucrats in order to express what we want, or rather, in order to disguise the real consequences of our steps.  All we need are three fundamental pillars, on which the European civilisation is based. Our programme is Christian morale, a free market and Parlamentarism.</p><p>
</p><p>Those are what we will measure with and what we measure each European directive, each vote in the European Parliament, each step of union institutions with. We refuse to impeach the Christian-Jewish fundaments of our civilisation. We refuse to adapt to multiculturalism in its aggressive, confining and restricting form. We promote a free market, the elimination of discrimination, and equal rights for citizens of big and small, old and new countries. We refuse over-inflated bureaucracy and pointless regulations. We are in favour of a significant role of national parliaments, as legitimate representatives of citizens’ will.</p><p>
</p><p>We are European conservatives and reformists. Some might feel conflict in those words. But we know well that there is no conflict in them. If thousands-of-year-old truths are no longer valid, change is in need. If values are withering away that our ancestors fought for and that made Europe strong and free, then it is high time for a conservative revolution! Do we have what it takes? Sure we do!</p><p>
</p><p>We do not see the European Union as it is, but as it could be. A European Union certain of its values. A European Union of voluntary and equal cooperation. A European Union that is freer and more democratic. That is the kind of European Union we want. We are in it together with you, our friends, allies and brothers!</p><p>

Michał Kamiński on the Goldstone Report,24-02-2010,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,283,"<p>
	</p><p>The Goldstone report is an extremely imbalanced and unjust report. This report comes from the UN Human Rights Committee, which includes countries such as Iran, Nicaragua, Somalia and Libya. What right do these countries have – where respect for human rights is less than none – to judge the only democracy in the Middle East, Israel?</p><p>
</p><p>This is a report that comes from a very questionable source – a source that is obsessively averse to the state of Israel. From 25 resolutions on human rights that this committee has adopted, 20 concern Israel.  None of them concern those countries, which are part of this committee, that have a terrible track record on human rights – starting with the rights of women and ending with voters’ rights.</p><p>
</p><p>I wish to underline that this report is completely imbalanced. In essence, it attempts to exonerate the terrorist activities of Hamas. This report does not gives us the basic fact that for eight years, before Israel began its activity in Gaza (in its own defence and with every right to do so), for eight years thousands of rockets were launched at innocent Israeli civilians. Every country has the right to defend itself against terrorists – Israel also has this right.</p><p>
</p><p>We should also mention that 150 criminal cases that examine the conduct of Israeli soldiers, are taking place in Israel.  In Israel, there is a free parliament and a free press that very often criticizes its own government and its own armed forces. None of these aspects – unfortunately – can be attributed to the terrorist side. This is why I believe that this imbalanced report, which is unjust and – in my opinion – shamelessly attacks our main ally in the Middle East, should not be taken seriously.</p><p>

Kaminski: For your freedom and ours,19-02-2010,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,2265,"<p>
	</p><p>Speaking last night to the Heritage Foundation in Washington DC, European Conservatives and Reformists chairman, Michal Kaminski MEP, called for a renaissance of the transatlantic alliance to meet renewed challenges to freedom and liberty.</p><p>
</p><p>He said:</p><p>
</p><p>“It is an extraordinary pleasure and privilege to speak to you at the Heritage Foundation, and particularly to be speaking at a centre named after one of the inspirations of my political life  – Margaret Thatcher.</p><p>
</p><p>Heritage is an organization dedicated to the principles of freedom, opportunity, prosperity, and civil society.  These are also the virtues upon which our transatlantic alliance is built and it is about the future of our alliance that I wish to speak today. I would like to share with you my views on just a few of the key strategic challenges facing our nations, and perhaps set out how I hope our new political group in the European Parliament, the European Conservatives and Reformists which I have the honour to lead, will assist with the regeneration of our enduring bond.</p><p>
</p><p>Our Group in the European Parliament was formed last July to ensure the cause of individual freedom and a small state had a powerful voice in Brussels. One of our group’s most important principles is to support the transatlantic alliance. This is why the first overseas visit of its parliamentary leadership is to DC: to let it be known that there is a new group in the European Parliament and that the American people have no stronger ally in the European Union.</p><p>
</p><p>This year, we marked the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Iron Curtain and the rebirth of freedom in Central and Eastern Europe. On this occasion, we were reminded of the successful defence of freedom against communism championed by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher which finally brought the Soviet Union to its knees, and allowed people to seize the opportunity to regain their freedom.</p><p>
</p><p>The clash of ideologies between freedom and communism was finally brought to an end.</p><p>
</p><p>But because the Cold War had dominated political thinking in the West for two generations, I think many had lost sight of the fact that the battle for freedom was not limited to the Second World War and the four decades which followed. It had begun earlier and did not end in 1989.</p><p>
</p><p>We have too easily forgotten the earlier struggles against the Soviet Union and these earlier efforts to combat tyranny on our Continent.</p><p>
</p><p>I believe that we should all remember that American pilots such Merian C. Cooper and Cedric Fauntleroy volunteered during the Polish-Soviet War between 1919 and 1921 and – as pilots of the Kościuszko Squadron – fought gallantly against the Bolsheviks.</p><p>
</p><p>During the Second World War, when our nations we called upon again to join together to defend freedom, the legacy of that squadron was upheld in the Battle of Britain: Squadron 303 (the Kościuszko squadron) was the best-ranked RAF unit. Serving in that fighter squadron was Czech pilot Josef František, first among the aces of the Battle of Britain. These men – American, Czech, British and Polish – exemplify the clear historical bonds that the countries in our new group in Brussels already enjoy. We bring together countries that are no strangers to cooperation.</p><p>
</p><p>However, this cooperation was abruptly ended in the aftermath of the Second World War when half of our continent was enslaved and bound by the shackles of Communism.</p><p>
</p><p>This division has left a legacy today which I believe can be seen in the differing reactions across Europe to the end of the Cold War.</p><p>
</p><p>For many, it seemed as if the battle for freedom had been won in 1989. We could celebrate and move on. The historic alliance between Europe and America was no longer required. We had nothing to fear of Russia, China or the Middle East. Economic progress would help these countries reform and we would all follow a similar path to liberal democracy. In a so-called ‘multi-polar world’ there would be no need for Europeans and Americans to be united</p><p>
</p><p>This dangerous wishful thinking is particular strong amongst left wing politicians in what Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld referred to as “Old” Europe. Whether we like it or not, our historical experience is at least partly responsible for the differing perceptions of the world today.  Many of those whose countries were liberated in 1944-45 seem to have forgotten the enormous sacrifice made by Americans in the cause of freedom. Perhaps if the whole of Europe had fallen to the Soviet Empire we would all share a common perception of the role of the United States as a power for good in international affairs. But sadly for many in the west of our continent, liberty and democracy are just taken for granted. They have grown complacent. As a result they have fallen victim to an anti-Americanism which seeks to undermine the leadership role that the United States has to play in the world.</p><p>
</p><p>Our Group rejects this naive world view. We believe that the need to defend freedom has not ended. We believe that the west remains engaged in a clash of ideologies – communism may have been defeated but we face the twin threats of jihadism and authoritarian capitalism.</p><p>
</p><p>We strive to create a Europe where our nations defend our common values and cooperate for mutual benefit, but rather than looking inwards upon ourselves as much of leftwing ‘Old’ Europe has done in recent years, our recent history has led us to believe in a Europe that looks outwards – and particularly westwards. We intend to draw upon our positive experiences of American leadership in the last century to ensure that the left in ‘old’ Europe does not, in the next century, drag us away from those partners to whom we owe our freedom.</p><p>
</p><p>In the Prague Declaration, which founded the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, we noted the overriding value of the transatlantic security relationship in a revitalized NATO. We believe that the United States is indispensable to Europe’s security. There is no reason to replace the North Atlantic Alliance with any other security structure. NATO is not an abstract agreement but a beacon of our common purpose and values.</p><p>
</p><p>This is where our group’s position will strengthen the transatlantic alliance. The EU does not need further integration, it needs fundamental reform. We need to be clear about the areas where the EU has competence – over the single market, trade policy, energy security and other policy fields where we have mutual interests – but it needs to leave the rest to the member states. Our group is championing wholesale reform of the EU to make it simpler and more transparent, and to move decision-making closer to the people.</p><p>
</p><p>We want all of the institutions of the European Union to prioritise relations with the United States and to foster these ties responsibly. We were dismayed to see the new powers gained by the European Parliament in the Lisbon Treaty used to strike down a crucial EU-US counter-terrorism measure, commonly known as the Swift agreement. The European Parliament sadly showed last week during the Swift discussions that it cannot yet handle its new powers in a sober and responsible manner. This is something we will seek to change.</p><p>
</p><p>We are told by some that the United States would find it easier to deal with Europe if it spoke with a single voice – to answer the question allegedly put by Kissinger: ‘when the President wants to speak to Europe, who does he call’? Well, right now you would probably have to call about four different numbers: Ashton, Van Rompuy, Barroso, and the Spanish presidency…so I suggest you call them collect…..</p><p>
</p><p>Let me make the position of my group clear: we support the idea that the nations of Europe should speak with a common voice on the key issues of the day where this is possible – not least as committed partners of the United States. But we completely reject any attempt to impose a single voice on the states of Europe through some kind of centralised federal superstate.</p><p>
</p><p>I believe that our vision of a leaner, more efficient EU would be a far better partner for the USA than a cumbersome, bureaucratic, backward-looking EU.</p><p>
</p><p>So our vision for institutional reform of the EU will make it easier for the US administration to do business in Europe. But we also want to make it easier for US enterprise to do business there too. I believe that our group’s policy platform – individualism, free enterprise, free trade and fair competition, minimal regulation, lower taxation, and small government – act as the ultimate catalyst for strengthening our alliance through trade. With the economic crisis, now is the time – more than ever – to display our conservative values that would enable dynamic entrepreneurs and successful businesses to rebuild our economies.</p><p>
</p><p>Our founding principles also underline our support for young democracies across Europe and in achieving these goals we need for the USA to continue to be devoted to the spread of democracy from the Baltic to the Black Sea. We must work together to keep guard over our vulnerable partners in Eastern Europe. Russia’s brand of authoritarian capitalism is a challenge to the West. Using different methods of intimidation, the Kremlin continues to put pressure on its neighbours and seeks to reacquire what it considers its sphere of influence as the “near abroad”.</p><p>
</p><p>The European Union still does not yet understand the danger. In the name of better relations with Russia it all too frequently chooses to look the other way. Today, the EU bemoans the lack of solidarity in our energy security, but projects like the Nord Stream pipeline are shamelessly pursued. This poses a threat to national security – not only to EU members that offer gas flow transit – but to countries like Ukraine, which have become hostages of Gazprom. Russia’s treatment of Georgia has echoes of the 1930s: the support for separatist movements, the undermining of a sovereign state, the military provocation, and ultimately the unilateral attempt to re-draw its borders. We need Washington to be involved in Central and Eastern Europe and to support all nations on our eastern borders that aspire to be members of the EU.</p><p>
</p><p>The common threat from fundamentalist regimes in the Middle East and their terrorist wing in the so-called jihad movement is a common threat we must overcome.</p><p>
</p><p>Tehran continues to encourage, equip, and fund terrorism throughout the region and to destabilize this vulnerable area. The Iranian nuclear challenge is, in my opinion, the toughest test of our resolve since at least 1989. The EU can and should play a role in standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the US administration in sending the strongest possible message – including the use of economic sanctions – that we will not allow Iran to develop nuclear weaponry. We need to be clear that we want a friendly and peaceful dialogue with Tehran, but that we are more than prepared to back up our rhetoric with action – and let me be clear: we should not exclude the military option if absolutely necessary.</p><p>
</p><p>We must have two guiding principles in shaping our policy in the Middle East. First, we must be resolute in our support for the only mature democracy and reliable partner in the region: Israel. We must not and will not tolerate any threats to its existence.</p><p>
</p><p>Second, we must support all those mainstream moderate forces in the region who believe, as we do, that there is no inherent contradiction between democratic and Islamic values – quite the reverse. We stand opposed to the way extremists distort the message of Islam to further their own totalitarian ends. This is why we must do all in our power to ensure Iraq flourishes and to encourage friendly neighbours down the path of further reform. And just beyond the region, it is why must ensure that we win the fight in Afghanistan and Pakistan. These are not ‘quarrels in far away countries between people of whom we know nothing’ – they are on the frontline of the struggle for freedom today.</p><p>
</p><p>There are many challenges that face our two continents and I have outlined just the main ones today. There are many more than time permits me, but in all the challenges, there is a common thread: the need for a united front among Western nations – not just the USA and the EU but peace-loving free nations around the world. Our new group is different because we do not see the transatlantic alliance as some kind of historic artefact, but as a vital bulwark of freedom and a bastion of liberty, which has preserved our civilisation. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, we have all become far too comfortable without a clear and present enemy. But the challenges are just as great – if not greater – in our more complex world. Our alliance, and the principles on which it is founded, has been allowed to drift, supported only by platitudes from many of our leaders. Our group is here to change that.</p><p>
</p><p>The ECR group will work to bring about a renaissance of this alliance. It was not a temporary association of convenience to meet the challenges of the Cold War but the lasting foundation of freedom and liberty – and we allow it to fade at our peril.</p><p>
</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe that the motto of the Kościuszko Squadron is as valid today as it ever was and the values it embodies are as necessary now as in the darkest days of the Second World War. It could serve as a motto for the transatlantic alliance: ‘For your freedom and for ours’.”</p><p>

Jan Zahradil: Missile Defense and the Czech Republic – Context and Consequences,18-02-2010,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,1955,"<p>
	</p><p>Presentation at the Heritage Foundation</p><p>
</p><p>Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>
It is indeed a pleasure for me to have again the opportunity to address such a like-minded audience here in Heritage, moreover with such a serious issue. I will go through the relatively short history of the whole project, then I will put it into appropriate geopolitical context and I will try also to bring some, hopefully positive, outcome.</p><p>
In 2002 the Prague NATO summit initiated a Missile Defense Feasibility Study in response to an increasing missile threat from so-calledi “rogue states” i.e. irresponsible regimes, their proxies or other non-state actors. Completed in 2006, the Study confirmed the feasibility of missile defense for NATO. By that time, the United States had already developed a limited ballistic missile defense architecture based on a network of radars and ground based interceptors (GBIs). At the same time, it was looking to geographically expand its system to better counter the existing and developing missile threats.</p><p>
As early as 2003 in 2004, preliminary talks began between the United States and several Central European countries, including the Czech Republic, about a possible placing of selected components of the US missile defense system on their territory. Ironically, the Czech Social Democrats, who were in government at the time, but later became staunch opponents of the system, were reasonably open to these discussions. Be it as it is, it was great paradox (but very typical in Central and Eastern European political environment) to listen recently to the very same person arguing – in his new role of political strategist to Social Democrats – against a system he himself had been promoting just a few years ago as a Minister of Defense in one of our former governments.</p><p>
In 2007 the government of the Czech Republic agreed to launch negotiations with the United States on placing of a mid-course radar that would become a part of   so-called US ballistic missile defense European site on Czech territory.</p><p>
With all this in mind, the negotiations started and in the summer 2008 the Main Agreement on stationing the mid-course radar on Czech territory was signed by the US Secretary of State and the Czech Foreign Minister. Shortly after that the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) was signed by the US and Czech Secretaries of Defense. In addition to these two key documents, a handful of other agreements have been or even still are being negotiated, including A Framework Agreement on participation of Czech businesses and academia in US missile defense related activities or a Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation Agreement (RDTE).</p><p>
In late 2008, the whole US-Czech negotiation process came to a halt. On the Czech side, the government proved incapable of securing the needed votes in the Lower House of the Parliament to pass both agreements, as the previously more open-minded leftist opposition has made missile defense a sensitive political topic. The approval of the Upper House – The Senate – was of course not sufficient. Also lack of public approval due to poor communication strategy (while opponents of the whole project targeted public much successfully) was apparent. Almost all the time 60-70 % of Czech citizens opposed the project, contrary to only up to 30 % who supported it. On the US side, the increasingly lame-duck Bush administration weakened its push for a quick progress, partially due to its disappointment at the lack of support in the Czech Republic. But also upcoming financial and economic crisis began steering Washington´s attention in other directions, too. There was little doubt changes would come in case a Democrat wins the US presidential elections.</p><p>
These changes indeed came. After a nine-month-long review the United States announced it would cancel the plans for GBIs in Poland and mid-course radar in the Czech Republic and opt for a different missile defense architecture in Europe – the so called Phased Adaptive Approach (or PAA). The new concept should be developed in four phases and envisions a strong link to a common NATO missile defense system.</p><p>
The US concluded that the long-range missile remains relatively low and missile defense efforts should concentrate on short and medium range missiles instead. It also concluded, that the advances in sensor technology render the proposed mid-course radar unnecessary and are able to create sufficient situational awareness using a dense network of minor sensors combined with a forward-based radar located in a different part of Europe. Last but not least, for the sake of cost-effectiveness, current assets, such as Aegis based SM-3 (Standard Missile 3) missiles, should preferably be used and modified as the system develops. The technical rationale behind the administration´s decision has since been subject to thorough debates.</p><p>
Firstly, although the threat posed by long range missiles ICBMs owned by rogue states remains relatively low in 2010, this might not be the case in 2015, as the tendency to acquire these systems by some problematic regimes or their proxies remains obvious.</p><p>
Secondly, it is very difficult to imagine a giant technological leap that the US defense industry had allegedly made in the field of sensor development within just a few years.</p><p>
Thirdly, it is fair to say that at this point, no-one can accurately predict and compare the costs of using traditional or modified GBIs with future land-based versions of SM-3 missile – the so called Aegis Ashore systems. A sole comparison of engagement costs seems overly simplistic. Development, testing and maintenance of any new system, usually requires expenditures that are difficult to predict.</p><p>
Anyhow, rather than purely technical considerations, the move was motivated mainly by the effort to visibly distance from the Bush administration policies as well as by hopes to appease Russia in a naive effort to obtain Moscow´s help in other areas. And therefore it is no doubt about the geopolitical ramifications of the US decision particularly with regards to Russia.</p><p>
The US missile defense system has been a hot geopolitical potato from the very start. Russia´s goals with regards to the system had been political and never based on merit (and they often acknowledged that even when talking to Czech officials). Moscow´s objective was to prevent building any new meaningful US or NATO infrastructure on the territory of former Eastern Bloc countries.</p><p>
Unfortunately, the Obama administration fell for it. The desire for a grand “reset” in mutual relations with Russia was among the most crucial ones. Today, it is becoming clear that this reset has not and will not materialize. Moscow has already started voicing some reservations about the Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense, too. The bellicose rhetoric about the necessity to develop new offensive systems is back, yet the much needed Russian help in other areas such as Afghanistan or Iran is negligible, if any. There is no doubt the same old arguments will come into play on missile defense, unless Russia gains a substantial level of control over the whole project. It would be a fatal mistake to provide her with it.</p><p>
And indeed, the Russian objections are already growing louder, as plans to develop the PAA are becoming more specific. The US push for more NATO involvement is most commendable, but might run into difficulties within the Alliance itself, with some of the allies like France and Germany. And now I come to geopolitical context of all this.</p><p>
EU today´s reality is defined by the Lisbon treaty. Instead of official reasons for introducing it – i.e. bringing more efficiency, transparency and accountability to the EU – it is clear and even provable that it was mainly a power exercise, just a pure redesign of EU power architecture. Under Lisbon treaty, the big players, particularly France and Germany, will once again regain and retain their control over processes and decisions within the  unprecedently enlarged EU. Combination of following main elements lead to this result : removal of veto right in the European Council while introducing QMV (qualified majority vote) as universal decision-making procedure, changing the definition of qualified majority from so-called weighted votes to new population-based principles (which favors most populous nations- like Germany that in fact doubles its power share in Council), further shift of national powers upwards to European level and strengthening the EU institutions like Commission and Parliament (that have been already to great extent controlled by big players). EU federalist “hard-core” is therefore once again running the whole EU business, with the Lisbon treaty. It has its direct consequences :  the federalist idea of the EU as a global power sees it rather as a challenger to the USA than a complementary force. And typically France and even more Germany do not wish to enter any new phase of dispute or even confrontation with reappearing Russia, for both business and trade as well as energy security reasons.</p><p>
Now – Russia attempts at least partly to revive its influence inside its former satellites and thus to enlarge its power diameter. It is apparent today and even more in the foreseeable future. Ukraine and Belarus are good examples. But even NATO and EU members are subjected to this pressure, most typically Baltic states, to less extent even Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria etc. and to even lesser extent, but still, Czechs and Poles. This Russian attitude is of course contrary to US interests as well as to interests of Central and Eastern European nations – the “new Europe”. But it is not that much contrary to some of the interests of “old Europe”. Indeed, some in there would not be against the idea to have between themselves and Russia a neutral buffer zone of those newly reborn democracies – despite their EU and NATO membership. And the Lisbon treaty gives them potentially greater say in defining overall EU objectives, including such strategic ones.</p><p>
From this point of view the geopolitical aspect of placing some NATO or even US missile defense elements in Central and Eastern Europe is perhaps even more important than its military and defense aspect. It would turn into politically balancing factor, counterweighting both Russian aspiration towards Central and Eastern Europe as well as overplayed ambitions of some within the EU. USA and Central and Eastern Europe share more or less the same interests here, unlike some other European nations.</p><p>
Now what is the way forward on missile defense and what could the Czech Republic´ s role be in the whole endeavor?</p><p>
Let me point out that even now we have enough substance to build upon. There are a number of useful agreements that have been concluded or are still being negotiated as a result of the previous US-Czech negotiating process. As some scientific and research cooperation on missile defense has been going on, these agreements should be used to further enhance such activities. There are numerous Czech scientists, researchers and companies with relevant expertise in missile defense related fields. Other bilateral arrangements, such as procurement agreements that would enable their participation in US projects should therefore follow to utilize the potential for further cooperation.</p><p>
And also some of the arguments for PAA do make sense. We are particularly pleased by a strong NATO dimension to the whole concept and we will continue to work with US – bilaterally and in NATO – to push the project forward. I hope, the future Czech government will give serious thought on the possibilities in placing some of the new system´s components on its soil – e.g. some command and control elements. That would be crucial for our position in this new, above-mentioned geopolitical context. I can also hope as well that Obama administration will soon properly analyze and recognize this context and then comes to a conclusion that strong US appearance in Central and Eastern Europe – including Czech Republic – is necessary and  irreplaceable. Let´s believe that once again political realism and common sense will prevail over relentless and unrepentant – and therefore dangerous – idealism.</p><p>
Thank you for your attention.</p><p>

Timothy Kirkhope in Washington: The Transatlantic alliance is more relevant than ever,17-02-2010,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,2208,"<p>
	</p><p>For our European Conservatives and Reformists group in the European Parliament, the transatlantic alliance is one of our most important principles. Our group has been successfully formed as a new centre-right bloc in the Parliament to give a voice to all those in Europe who support a free market, outward-looking European Union which respects the powers of its member states. And we are totally committed to the defence of the Atlantic Alliance. This is why the Presidency of the Group is here in Washington this week – to demonstrate that commitment and forge new links.</p><p>
</p><p>Today I want to consider the challenges faced by the Alliance in two key fields – one is political and one is economic.</p><p>
</p><p>One of the moments of greatest danger for the security of any state is that period following the defeat or collapse of a long-standing opponent.</p><p>
</p><p>When so much energy, mental effort and physical endurance have been devoted to the defeat of one adversary, it is all too easy to succumb to the temptation to savour the victory and sit back.   In the aftermath of triumph, the temptations of a so-called ‘peace dividend’ often prove too great.</p><p>
</p><p>After the defeat of Napoleon, Britain basked in the glow of Trafalgar and Waterloo for decades, slow to appreciate the consequences of the rise of Prussia and its successor, Imperial Germany, preferring a policy of ‘splendid isolation’ until it was almost too late.</p><p>
</p><p>After the First World War, far-sighted leaders in the West could not persuade their compatriots of the need to challenge the creation of a communist state in Russia. Attempts to support the efforts of “White Russians” to counter the new “Red” state were half-hearted and not sustained. Public opinion wanted money spent on ‘homes fit for heroes’ rather than military support for one side in a Russian civil war. And In the United States, despite the obvious failure of the policy before 1917, the attractions of a return to its own kind of isolationism proved irresistible.</p><p>
</p><p>But after the end of the Second World War, we heard the warning in time. US troops were being pulled out of Europe and Britain was demobilising to divert resources to its new welfare state when a combination of Stalin’s greed over Prague and Berlin, and later China’s over Korea, galvanised western opinion just in time to make resistance possible.</p><p>
</p><p>The United States helped to revive the economy of western Europe with the Marshall Plan and guaranteed its security with the creation of NATO. Effective leadership in the United States and in Europe was able to persuade public opinion to make the sustained effort required over four decades to win the Cold War. In resisting the Soviet Union, the west effectively broke its state controlled and artificial economy and then its confidence. With the Soviet Union in a growing state of collapse, the peoples of central and eastern Europe were then, with our support, able to assert their rights and chose freedom. A peaceful revolution which began in Poland and climaxed in Berlin, when the Wall fell ,transformed Europe.</p><p>
</p><p>But, since 1989, have we just enjoyed that victory or have we seriously heeded the warnings about the future?</p><p>
</p><p>THE JIHADIST THREAT</p><p>
</p><p>Following the collapse of the Soviet bloc, the west, predictably, succumbed to temptation to enjoy the victory. It was the ‘end of history’. We had apparently won the final battle.</p><p>
</p><p>All of that changed during the morning of 11th September 2001.</p><p>
</p><p>The attacks on the twin towers and here in Washington and in the American countryside were  terrible tragedies. None of us will ever forget those images, or the sacrifice of the victims.</p><p>
</p><p>But, like Stalin and Mao before them, had our enemies also made a strategic mistake?</p><p>
</p><p>They alerted the whole western world to the danger now posed to our way of life by the jihadist extremists.</p><p>
</p><p>This conflict began as a civil battle within the islamic world: between on the one hand the once-confident mainstream, looking forward to a new century of economic development and political modernisation consistent with traditional religious beliefs, and yet opposed on the other by a reactionary, intolerant, violent minority. They seek the overthrow of existing regimes in order to establish a religious tyranny to impose their fundamentalist views on their own peoples and ultimately on the world. And they are a minority. The vast majority of adherents to the Islamic faith believe in peace, democracy, responsibility, and freedom.</p><p>
</p><p>But this was a battle we had ignored for too long. It had been too easy to push concerns aside on the grounds that this conflict was just about the politics of the Middle East. If only peace were made between Israel and the Palestinians, the problem would magically go away. Whilst a peace settlement must be pursued in the interests of both Israel and the Palestinians – and we must never waver in our support for Israel as our trusted ally and the only stable, mature democracy in the region – we must never confuse the two issues.</p><p>
</p><p>The jihadists do not want a peace settlement. A peace settlement would make their cause harder to sustain amongst those who have fallen for the obscene lie that the jihadists are simply defending the Palestinian cause. The nature of their struggle is different. They don’t want peace, they want power. The power achieved through fear.</p><p>
</p><p>- Public opinion was slow to understand the full gravity of the challenge. But after 9/11 it could be ignored no more.</p><p>
</p><p>CHINA</p><p>
</p><p>If we face a grave immediate political threat, the free world faces a more difficult economic challenge.</p><p>
</p><p>For more than two centuries, the most liberal and, more recently, the most democratic states on the planet have also been those with the most advanced economies. From the creation of the Bank of England in 1694 which gave Britain the financial means to defeat France’s ambitions in the 18th century, through the industrial revolution which gave it the capability to dominate the 19th century, and up to our own era when the economic muscle of the United States made it the arsenal of democracy, economic and political power have been aligned.</p><p>
</p><p>Indeed we have grown up with the idea that political and economic freedom are two sides of the same coin – that they have progressed together because they are mutually reinforcing.</p><p>
</p><p>So how  should we react when the link seems to have been broken?</p><p>
</p><p>Global economic power is moving dramatically in favour of China. Only this year it has become the world’s biggest exporter and its economy is on course to be the world’s second largest in the near future.  Today China is a rival, rather than an opponent, and there is of course a danger that any prophesy becomes self-fulfilling. So we must seek to build a positive relationship with China, but we must also not ignore reality.</p><p>
</p><p>We had believed that economic progress in China would stimulate political liberalisation.</p><p>
</p><p>And yet during the course of 1989, whilst we were celebrating the birth of a new Europe, thousands of protestors were killed in Tianamen Square for daring to call for freedom and reform. We remember those scenes of course but we have tried to move on. Is there a risk that we are still too complacent?</p><p>
</p><p>We must not be as naive as some of our nineteenth century forebears who simply thought that economic growth, free trade, and economic interdependence would promote peace and encourage the spread of democracy.</p><p>
</p><p>China is becoming economically more powerful every day but what does its future hold? Will it liberalise? When? How? What risk is there of a backlash even more violent than the Tianamen Square massacre? Could the Communist Party grow more nationalist and extreme – perhaps when under pressure during a domestic economic crisis? Could the military one day replace the Party as the dominant force in Chinese political life?</p><p>
</p><p>We might trust the current regime even if we oppose the way they put economic advantage ahead of political concerns – from Venezuela, through Sudan and Iran to North Korea. But we must never lose sight of the fact that considerable economic power is being concentrated in Beijing and it may not always be in hands we can trust.</p><p>
</p><p>Democracy and human rights therefore face two critical strategic challenges in the twenty-first century: the political challenge of jihadism and the economic challenge of authoritarian capitalism.</p><p>
</p><p>How should we approach these questions?</p><p>
</p><p>Firstly, the west must be united. Loose talk by some in Europe and beyond about a multi-polar world with Europe and the United States as two separate poles is at best unhelpful and at worse highly dangerous. The west – in its broadest sense – is a single pole and we must stand together to defend the values of democratic government and the freedom of the individual. The transatlantic relationship is not some historic legacy of the Cold War that is now irrelevant. its sense of common purpose and mutual support must be maintained but it must also be  refreshed.</p><p>
</p><p>In practical terms, this means we must stand together in dealing with immediate threats such as Iran’s and North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, and in sustaining the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan. European states in particular need to match their resources to their rhetoric.</p><p>
</p><p>The European Union has a part to play as a supporting pillar of the Alliance but it must be clear about its role. It can provide a useful means for concerted European action by its member states, particularly in areas related to civilian reconstruction and development. But there is absolutely no need for it to aspire to a military role to the detriment of NATO. Nothing must undermine the Alliance’s purpose or function.</p><p>
</p><p>Secondly, we must reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism. Informal groups of states can of course cooperate usefully to achieve specific, limited objectives. But campaigns that must be sustained over the course of decades need to be underpinned by a commitment to common institutions. That is the secret of NATO: it was not a coalition for the short-term, but an alliance for the long-term.  Communism was not defeated because of shifting, unstable, unpredictable combinations of western democracies; it was defeated because the west as a whole stood united in its defiance of the Soviet Union and it is important to remember that the first alliance that the newly free States including our friends from Poland and the Czech republic applied to join was NATO – ahead of the EU.</p><p>
</p><p>NATO is already a kind of ‘league of democracies’. Perhaps we now need to be more imaginative in devising ways of connecting other long-term partners of the United States and Europe to its work. Without diluting or weakening in any way its military integration, perhaps allies from across the world – in the far east, south-east Asia, South America and Africa – could be more closely associated with its work as a political alliance dedicated to upholding freedom?</p><p>
</p><p>Thirdly, public opinion needs to understand this will be a long haul.   During the four decades of the Cold War, sustained leadership ensured that public opinion across the west remained resolute. We need a similar commitment today. But already there are signs that our resolve is weakening. Public opinion swung against the campaign in Iraq and its determination is faltering in Afghanistan despite the latest advances there. Yet these are crucial battlegrounds in the fight against jihadism. In the Conservative Party we do not believe that models of democracy can simply be transported across the globe wholesale – they need to develop from within traditional communities. We do believe though that they can be nurtured and supported as they grow. Institutions such as the European Union and Commonwealth can make vitally important contributions to this process.</p><p>
</p><p>Finally we must collaborate to return to sustainable economic growth. The long-term future of the west depends ultimately on our economic success. Individually our nations must prioritise education and training, and create a stable climate in which business and entrepreneurs can thrive, generating growth and jobs.</p><p>
</p><p>Our economic recovery will need to be on a new basis contrasting with the recent 90s boom. We now know that It was both economically reckless and morally wrong to fund our current lifestyles by borrowing money which our children and probably grandchildren will have to repay. Economic recovery must be based on a renewed commitment to saving and investment.</p><p>
</p><p>These are of course decisions for individuals and states. But the west can cooperate on several issues of vital importance: promoting global free trade, ensuring any reforms of our international economic institutions are workable and serve our interests. And we need to work together to undertake balanced action on climate change – a subject where we urgently need to listen to each others’ concerns and forge a new consensus.</p><p>
</p><p>Mr Chairman, since the Atlantic Charter was agreed by President Roosevelt and Winston Churchill in August 1941 and subsequently endorsed by the free governments of Europe represented in London a month later, the transatlantic relationship has been a powerful and decisive force for good in global affairs. I believe this remains true today. Ahead of us, we face political and economic challenges of such a magnitude that the time has come to devote considerable energy to reinvigorating this alliance for a new century.”</p><p>

"Speech to the ECR bureau meeting by Mrs Tineke Huizinga, Netherlands Vice-Minister for Transport",03-02-2010,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,621,"<p>
	</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>
</p><p>It is good to be here, after a frantic day in The Hague.</p><p>
As Vice Minister for Transport, Public Works and Water Management and as a member of the Christian Union, I am honoured to welcome you onto Dutch soil.</p><p>
</p><p>The European Union has a major influence on the policy areas of Transport, Public Works and Water Management. I can hardly imagine an issue within this field that is not affected in one way or another by decisions at the European level.</p><p>
Market access in road transport, rail corridors, air traffic and emissions trading, water quality.</p><p>
People often talk about Europe in abstract terms, something that is a long way away, but Europe is actually quite concrete.</p><p>
</p><p>Europe involves the issues I am dealing with every day, the things all of us are working on together.</p><p>
The Netherlands was last year ranked the second largest exporter in Europe, after Germany. A top-notch performance!</p><p>
We export more than countries like France, the United Kingdom and Italy. These are countries with populations three times larger than ours.</p><p>
This is a fine performance. But it does not hide the fact that the transport sector is hard pressed in this economic crisis. In 2008 and 2009 the strong relationship between the economy, trade and the transport sector once again became obvious.</p><p>
</p><p>A crisis often paves the way for protectionism. During the past year, this has been illustrated by several examples in Europe.</p><p>
However, protectionism will not help us to overcome the crisis. National measures, exclusively aimed at boosting a country’s own economy, are counterproductive.</p><p>
They have a negative effect on trade and transport volumes.</p><p>
Not only in the open Dutch economy, but across all European economies.</p><p>
</p><p>It is imperative that we counter the negative consequences of the crisis at the European level.</p><p>
With the European and Dutch ambitions in the field of climate policy at the back of our minds, we must seize the opportunity to convert the transport sector into a sustainable, innovative one. This pertains to inland shipping in particular. The most sustainable mode of goods transport. This is something your group, represented by Peter van Dalen, is making a strong case for in the European Parliament. And with good reason.</p><p>
The business community needs to do its part, however difficult that may be at the moment.</p><p>
However, the business community may expect something from the government as well.</p><p>
</p><p>At the European level too, there is work to be done, in order to get the transport sector on its feet again after the crisis.</p><p>
In my opinion, the European agenda for the future should also include the following issues:</p><p>
</p><p>Focusing on the simplification and removal of existing rules and regulations, instead of implementing (more) new rules and regulations</p><p>
Innovation schemes focusing on clever logistics and climate-proofing our living environment</p><p>
</p><p>But also the issue of sustainability.</p><p>
One of the principles that the European Conservatives and Reformists Group share is that of dedicating themselves to a sustainable society.</p><p>
For the Christian Union and for the Dutch Cabinet as well, dedication to a sustainable society is a main aim. Not based on a view that government policies can change the world, but in the knowledge that Creation is delicate. Something we must take good care of, also in the interests of our children and grandchildren.</p><p>
That is why I call on you to make a real effort in the years ahead, at the European level, to create a sustainable society (ensuring, incidentally, that Europe sets realistic targets in its directives).</p><p>
I wish you a great deal of wisdom in your work as members of the European Parliament, fruitful workshops in our country and, in a moment, a wonderful dinner.</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p><p>

Democratisation in Turkey (debate),20-01-2010,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,350,"<p>
	</p><p>Jan Zahradil (ECR ). – (CS) I am speaking from the position of someone who supports Turkey’s membership of the European Union as a fully-fledged member, and not as a substitute or a kind of privileged partner; and I would like to add a few critical words levelled at our own ranks. We perceive Turkey from the position of an organisation which has promised that country full membership of the European Union but which, at the same time, is unable to guarantee that if it does meet all the conditions we are demanding from it, it will really achieve full membership.</p><p>
</p><p>The position of the European Parliament in this matter is clear. The institution has expressed its clear-cut approval; the stance of the European Commission is also clear and, in this respect, I can only join in praising Commissioner Rehn for his objectivity and for the great job he has done in this cause over the past five years. The position of the European Council is not that clear, because there are still governments of some Member States that simply refuse to make it quite clear that as long as Turkey meets all the conditions we require of it, it can become a fully-fledged member of the European Union. In this case, we are involved in double dealing and becoming untrustworthy; and we can hardly ask for something from someone to whom we are unable to guarantee that we will meet our own promises.</p><p>
</p><p>Secondly, Turkish democracy is simply quite specific in its own right. While we justifiably urge that country to bring its standards closer to European standards, while we justifiably call, for example, for the role of its army to be limited, we should also realise what this is going to mean and what impact this is going to have on the structure of Turkish society and on the entire nature of Turkish democracy. I am afraid that our mechanical evaluation of the criteria for democratisation could eventually do more harm than good, and I would advocate more sensitivity, more responsiveness, and more empathy for Turkey in this matter. </p><p>

Lajos Bokros: Structural problems with the EU-Budget,15-12-2009,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,656,"<p>
	</p><p>
</p><p>1. The EU-budget is too big</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It has become systematically larger than 1% of the aggregated GNI of the European Union without a clear justification and rationale.</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. The EU-budget keeps growing</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>According to the multi-year financial framework (MFF), there are built-in      automatic increases for many items, especially for operating costs of the bureaucracy without any apparent improvement of output perfomance. It is unacceptable and unjustifiable, especially at times of crisis.</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3. </p><p>The common budget lacks common values</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p>All budgets are supposed to be mirror images of some economic policy considerations. The EU-budget is an exception, it does not reflect any consistent set of common values. Instead, it tries to justify an EU-wide policy of neo-keynesian demand management by spending more on the great majority of items without any underlying structural reforms.</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>4. </p><p>Unnecessary, distortionary spending items are many</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Take the example of the European Globalization Adjustment Fund. Half a billion euro is supposed to be spent on mitigating the negative impact of globalization. Instead, member states are having a hard time to put together rational proposals for a couple of tens of millions. On the one hand it is a tremendous waste of scarce resources. On the other it is a prime example of distorting the rules of creative destruction in capitalism.</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>5. </p><p>Last minute items more important than politically correct ones</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>COBU was unhappy to see a new item, the cost of decommissioning the Kozloduy nuclear power plant coming up at the last minute. It was a sign of bad planning on the part of the European Commission. Nevertheless, not only the decommissioning of Kozloduy, but even support to the construction of a new nuclear power plant would be more important than  spending in the milk fund with its untimely and inefficient increase.</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>6. </p><p>The EU-empire of bureaucracy shields itself from the crisis</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p>As if it was part of a beneficial demand boost, the EU-bureaucracy gets undeserved and unnecessary wage increases. When the EU is struggling with a once-in-a-lifetime deep recession it is just not appropriate to shield ourselves and our own administration from the negative consequences. Would it not be more appropriate to accept even a nominal wage decline and, hence, boost employment in name of European solidarity ?</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>7. </p><p>More commitments pushed to the future decrease flexibility</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is a worrying sign of inadequate planning that the disparity between commitment and payment appropriations is growing in case of a large number of items. Since we cannot incur a deficit, we push more and more commitments to the future. It is tantamount  to mortgaging the future of the EU and undermine prospective discretionary spending beyond repair.</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>8. </p><p>Instead of the past, let us concentrate on the future </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Many MEPs are concentrating on pet projects and pork barrel spending. The budget should not be a used as a backward looking tool preserving the status quo but a forward looking instrument sharpening the institutional and regulatory framework of the EU which, in turn, should aim at strengthening the single market. Less protection to vested interests is the key for the EU to avoid sinking into irrelevance at the world stage.</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>9. </p><p>Instead of crisis management, improve competitiveness</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is a mistaken belief that the EU-budget is there to fight the global crisis. A fiscal tool of this size is completely inadequate for that and rightly so. It is the task of national fiscal policies to mitigate the negative impact of the crisis. Budgetary cuts introduced by the Council on structural and cohesion funds are, therefore, welcome, while it is important to make the rules of their utilization more flexible and less bureaucratic.</p><p>

Speech Peter van Dalen (ChristenUnie) in the debate about the peace process in the Middle-East,15-12-2009,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,243,"<p>
	</p><p>President,</p><p>
</p><p>Especially during the current Advent period, many people pray for peace in the Middle-East. But sometimes you get despondent about the situation and you think: peace will never come. However, all parties in this process need to keep on working on it.</p><p>
</p><p>But that’s exactly the problem: can and will all involved parties work towards peace? In previous times, Israel has taken steps by sharing land for peace: look for example to the evacuation of parts of the Gaza-strip in 2005. This did not lead to peace: the attacks by rocket missiles even increased, which led to the Israeli invasion in 2009.</p><p>
</p><p>Israel has now announced a temporary stop on building in the West Bank. It has also lifted several road blocks. This must be seen as a gesture to come to peace-negotiations. Such steps from the government of Benjamin Nethanyahu are from an Israeli point of view, quite radical and far-reaching</p><p>
</p><p>On the Palestinian side, I see no movement. They keep saying Israel is doing nothing for the peace process, full stop. The Palestinians lack any movement to start negotiations. Is there a Palestinian will and capability to start the negotiations? Hamas seems to be entangled in the fight with Fatah, and to be firmly chained to Iran. Mahmoud Abbas looks like a paper tiger, which has no influence at all. It’s time the Palestinians as well show in a very clear and open way that they want peace as well.</p><p>

Prospects for the Doha Development Agenda following the Seventh WTO Ministerial Conference (debate),14-12-2009,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,309,"<p>
	</p><p>Jan Zahradil, on behalf of the ECR Group. – (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, we are, of course, in a period of economic recession or crisis and it is unpleasant, but such crises come and go, they are a cyclical component of the market economy and they must not be used as an excuse for introducing excessive regulations restraining the economy, as such regulations will remain even after the crisis itself has ended, and this also concerns international trade. The European Union must therefore avoid succumbing to the lure of protectionism in commercial relations, as we would damage not only ourselves through this, but especially those whom we seek to assist, in other words, especially the least developed countries, whose full integration into the global commercial system we must promote.</p><p>
</p><p>On behalf of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, I would like to applaud the approach of the European People’s Party Group and the ALDE Group, who have drafted together with us a balanced draft resolution on the development agenda from Doha following the seventh conference of the World Trade Organisation. Progress in international trade must serve this development agenda and if the US has problems with that, then the EU must take a leading role in the successful completion of the Doha Round and also in mediating the full participation of these least developed countries in world trade.</p><p>
</p><p>European integration began with free trade. The EU or the European Community began as a trading zone and the European Commission – in both its current and future line-ups – will be aware, I hope, of where the roots of European integration lie and will return to them. We should continue to mediate the full participation of these least developed countries in world trade and also the signing of further bilateral and regional free trade agreements as a supplement to the multilateral framework.</p><p>

Speech on the plenary session of the European Parliament on the Slovak language law,24-11-2009,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,618,"<p>
	</p><p>The Slovak language is one of the most beautiful languages of Europe. It is unfortunate, therefore, that it is very seldom heard in the European Parliament. As a true friend of Slovakia, a supporter of its development, a modest but active contributor to the famous and groundbreaking Slovak reforms and, of course, as a Hungarian I wish to help my Slovak friends to reduce this disadvantage and make the Slovak language more audible, well-known and popular for a widest possible audience. That is the way to preserve as much as it is possible the rich and diverse Slovak language and culture. It is clearly in the interest of all of us.</p><p>
</p><p>At the same time the Slovak language does not wish to flourish at the detriment of other languages. It has no need to. It is incomprehensible, therefore, that the law regulating the use of languages of national minorities in Slovakia restricts the use these languages compared to that of the Slovak. It only allows rather than prescribes the use of minority languages. The use of minority languages cannot be interpreted as a claim right which can be demanded and enforced in official communication. There are no Hungarian-language documents available in government offices. There is no official Hungarian-language translation and edition of Slovak laws and regulations at all.</p><p>
</p><p>This fairly disadvantageous situation has further deteriorated after the modification of the Slovak language law which entered into force in September. National minorities were not consulted on the new legislation.</p><p>
</p><p>The most important problem of the new legislation is that it regulates not only the official use of different languages but it goes deeply into public, business and even private life.</p><p>
</p><p>The other important problem is that the modified law stipulates punishment. It introduces the concept of linguistic misdemeanor against autochton minority languages. This is unacceptable. Moreover, it is not at all clear what the basis of such misdemeanor might be in specific cases. This can open the doors to governmental abuse. It is also deplorable from moral point of view because it gives an incentive to citizens to spy on each other and report each other to the authorities on the basis of real or perceived violations of the law. This arrangement will deteriorate public culture and undermine the democratic cohesion of society as well.</p><p>
</p><p>The Slovak government claims that the regulation in the law will be made more precise with executive ordinance. It has not happened to this day. There is no public debate on the planned specific regulation and the intention of the government is unknown. Once again, the government of Slovakia is unwilling to consult the parliamentary representatives of national minorities.</p><p>
</p><p>On this basis I feel that the modification of the Slovak language law violates basic human rights and norms of the European Union. Moreover, the law in its present form does not meet the interests of the Slovak state and the majority nation either. It creates suspicion and poisons the atmosphere among nations which have been living together for thousand years. It serves no interest of anybody in its present form.</p><p>
</p><p>Slovakia today is a mature, grown-up, self-assertive democracy. Slovakia does not need a kulturkampf, a legal protection against the  languages of national minorities. The autochton nations do not threaten the Slovak state, the Slovak nation and the Slovak language. On the contrary: peoples living side by side will enthusiastically protect, support and develop the Slovak language if the Slovak nation is willing to protect, support and develop the languages of national minorities as well.</p><p>
</p><p>I believe this is what corresponds most to the fundamental European ideal of “united in diversity”.</p><p>

Leader of the ECR Group delivered key note at the ODS Congress in Prague,20-11-2009,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,476,"<p>
	</p><p>It is a great honour and I am truly touched that I am able to stand before you – dear friends of the ODS – as the leader of our common group in the European Parliament. Actually, I should not say “friends” but “brothers.” Because, ever since I was a child, I have been taught to speak about the Czech nation as “our Czech brothers.” This beautiful city where we are today is a testimony of how much the Czechs have given – and continue to give – to Europe; testimony of how much they have given to Poles. It is in Prague that the mother of the first Polish king – Bolesław Chrobry – is buried: the Czech princess Dobrawa.</p><p>
</p><p>Today, we have the year 2009. This autumn, we are reminded of the autumn twenty years ago when we both were regaining our freedom and sovereignty. Twenty years ago, we witnessed the bankruptcy of a system that built its future on denying two extraordinarily important aspects of social life: the love of one’s nation and of the free market. We were indeed lucky that in the 80′s the West was guided by individuals who understood the evils of communism and who knew that it is wrong to compromise with evil. Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher – to them we owe our victory, our freedom. It is therefore symbolic that today the largest centre-right parties in the Czech Republic and Poland constitute one group in the European Parliament, together with the British Conservatives, the party of Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher.</p><p>
</p><p>Our cooperation has brought results. It is well known today that others have not been able to marginalize us and that the European Conservatives and Reformists Group is an effective tool in the fight for a better Europe. Finally, a voice can be heard in Brussels and Strasburg – a voice that says: more freedom, more democracy, more free market and more solidarity in our common Europe. Our MEPs work everyday to bring a less regulated and less ideological Europe closer to its citizens. The contribution of ODS MEPs to the success of our group is invaluable. ODS deputies in the European Parliament inspire us with their hard work and professionalism. I can boldly say today: “Czech brothers! You can be proud of those who represent you in Europe.”</p><p>
</p><p>We in Poland have had problems with unity and effectiveness of the centre-right. From the early 90′s, ODS was for us and example of a wise and effective centre-right party in our part of Europe. This wisdom and effectiveness was confirmed this year by your leader, Mirek Topolanek, who led your country and all of Europe in a very difficult time.</p><p>
</p><p>I have deep confidence in your success. I wish you this success because I know that it is in the interest of the Czech nation, all your closest neighbours and all of Europe.</p><p>

The 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall,10-11-2009,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,837,"<p>
	</p><p>As we commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin wall, we can look back on the transformation of Eastern Europe. In just two decades our nations have thrown off the yolk of communism and become major actors in the European Union.</p><p>
</p><p>As a teenager, as I listened to illegal broadcasts of the BBC, the prospect of Poland enjoying similar levels of freedom as Western Europe was a dream. </p><p>
</p><p>If you had told me then that I would be the President of a political group in the European Parliament and that a Pole would be the President of the parliament itself, I would have struggled to believe you.</p><p>
</p><p>But this has been made possible not only thanks to the steely determination of great politicians such as Ronald Regan and Margaret Thatcher (whose Conservative party I am proud to sit with in the parliament), but also because of the millions of indefatigable ordinary citizens who resisted the Communists’ iron fist and kept on fighting for their freedom.</p><p>
</p><p>Look at how far we have come. And it was all made possible because of people power.</p><p>
</p><p>But as we consign that aspect of our past to the history books, the next great challenge will be making the European Union work for the people, not for the governing elites, as we head into the second decade of the 21st century.</p><p>
</p><p>The EU has become disconnected from the people, but if you read most commentators – particularly from ‘old’ Europe – you would believe that change in the EU is impossible. That’s exactly what they told us in Eastern Europe.</p><p>
</p><p>Don’t misinterpret what I am saying: I am not comparing the EU to the Soviet Union. I believe that there can be no comparison between such an oppressive and destructive regime and the EU. However the EU does need urgent change that is rooted in returning the EU to the people.</p><p>
</p><p>The European Union and its 27 nation states acting together can add real value to individual nations, beyond if they were acting alone.</p><p>
</p><p>Take, for example, the energy challenge we face. Reducing our dependence on Russian gas and Middle Eastern oil will mitigate the effect of energy as a political tool; and developing new innovative solutions to our energy dilemma can only be positive if we are to reduce pollution. By acting together the EU can create market-based incentives for the development of new technology, whilst 27 countries carry far more weight at the Kremlin that just one.</p><p>
</p><p>It will also be important that we work together in order to see off other threats to our security. Iran poses the greatest challenge to the Western world in at least 20 years. Tough love from the EU now will pay dividends in the future and I hope that when it comes to showing global leadership on this issue, the EU will not shrink from its responsibilities.</p><p>
</p><p>At home the EU must continue to provide new opportunities for entrepreneurs and multi-national corporations alike. Most crucial to achieving this goal will be the completion of the Single Market. I am proud that the ECR group has the chairmanship of the Internal Market committee of the European Parliament and, in Malcolm Harbour, we could not ask for a more devoted and passionate advocate of opening markets. The Single Market has gone from being a principle on paper to a reality, yet its full potential has been far from realised.</p><p>
</p><p>In response to a question I asked President Barroso at the parliament’s first question time in Strasbourg, he announced that he was creating a high level group to look at new ways of invigorating our single market. This will need more than a vague commitment to reducing bureaucracy. There is enough support in the European Parliament from the EPP, some ALDE members and the ECR, for the commission to bring forward some revolutionary ideas for our single market that will benefit us all.</p><p>
</p><p>Tearing down the barriers within our continent will be irrelevant if we replace them with a protectionist wall around it. Free trade is not a threat to Europe, it is an opportunity that must be embraced. It can be painful sometimes but in the long run it will make people richer and freer.</p><p>
</p><p>I firmly believe that the major problem with the EU is not its communications strategy, or even its institutional make-up. It is the EU’s policies. If it were to focus only on areas where it adds value, we will finally start to see it reconnect with the people.</p><p>
</p><p>When we look at the European Union in twenty years time, will it have changed as much as Eastern Europe has in the past twenty? The need for reform is urgent but I sincerely hope that the EU rises to the challenge because I want it to be a great success.</p><p>
</p><p>Ultimately, that change will involve handing the EU back to the people so that the state will become much smaller and the individual much bigger. People power must reign again.</p><p>

Timothy Kirkhope speaking in the Debate ahead of the European Council summit on 29th October,21-10-2009,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,482,"<p>
	</p><p>Timothy Kirkhope, </p><p>on behalf of the ECR Group</p><p>.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> Mr President, may I first of all congratulate the Swedish Government on its Presidency in general and particularly on the way it has attempted to advance the very important issues of climate change and dealing with the economic and financial crisis that faces us. I think Mr Reinfeldt and his Government deserve our thanks for the way they have done this but, as has been the situation in many Presidencies, they have also had to accommodate a lot of internal institutional distractions – in this case in relation to the Lisbon Treaty.</p><p>
</p><p>Institutional theology is not the priority of the citizens of Europe. What we need, of course, is the Lisbon Agenda, not the Lisbon Treaty.</p><p>
</p><p>The Lisbon Agenda has a noble objective: an objective of creating the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs, greater social cohesion and respect for the environment by 2010.</p><p>
</p><p>Now that should have made a real difference in the lives of millions of people and provided a firm foundation for our economic future and yet, as Mr Reinfeldt himself said, the Lisbon Agenda has been a failure.</p><p>
</p><p>Why can we never actually get results that matter to our citizens? The laudable aims in the Laeken Declaration were not then put into practice, and now the Lisbon Agenda faces the same lack of purpose and achievement.</p><p>
</p><p>So near, Mr President, but so far, and again initiatives relating to the economies of Member States must be clearly understandable to ordinary people. Job creation should not be about creating jobs for former Prime Ministers to be President of the Council, or for globetrotting aficionados to be High Representatives for Foreign Affairs.</p><p>
</p><p>Those two jobs will hardly help hard-pressed small and medium-sized businesses in any of our countries. They will not ease the crisis being borne by millions of families right now.</p><p>
</p><p>And institutional changes do not help with climate changes. The greatest threats to our world need confronting, and practical and workable solutions need to be found. Thousands of pages of text, most of it too complicated for our citizens ever to understand, simply consumes the trees that we need to protect.</p><p>
</p><p>Let us put pressure on the world community to come together to save the planet for future generations, not on those who do not fully share the enthusiasm of some people for the European institutions.</p><p>
</p><p>Despite all this, I do hope that the Swedish Presidency is able, in the time remaining to it, and indeed at the Summit, to focus the attention of all European leaders on the major issues that concern the people – those issues they concentrated upon at the start of their Presidency regarding the economy, Europe and indeed climate change. I wish them well in the remaining time and thank them for their work so far.</p><p>

Speech to Party Conference in Manchester,08-10-2009,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,843,"<p>
	</p><p>Mr Chairman, Conference,</p><p>
</p><p>I am absolutely delighted to be here today not only as the Leader of the UK Conservative delegation in the European Parliament but, for the first time, as the Deputy Chairman of our new group: the European Conservatives and Reformists.</p><p>
</p><p>I am proud that David Cameron’s pledge to build a new strong and influential group in the European Parliament has been fulfilled. With David’s commitment and the support of William Hague and Mark Francois, we have been able to establish a Group which will promote a common vision of Europe.</p><p>
</p><p>And this could not have been achieved without your support during the election campaign in June. I and my colleagues are grateful to you for all the work you put into that election; and to our Members of Parliament and our shadow front bench team for their campaigns throughout the country. As a result, we were once again able to send a strong team back to the European Parliament with the credibility to then reach out to MEPs from other countries to form our new alliance.</p><p>
</p><p>Our opponents told us that we would fail, or that we would have no option but to create a weak and marginalised group without power or influence. But now our critics including current Foreign Secretary, David Milliband,- but not for much longer William – have had to resort to personal attacks.</p><p>
</p><p>Labour’s public tactics betray their private desperation. The importance of the ECR in the European Parliament was demonstrated in our first big test: the re-election of José Manuel Barroso as President of the EU Commission. At times we have all disagreed with Mr Barroso and doubtless we will again. But we appreciated his staunch defence of free market principles, de-regulation and opposition to protectionism and state intervention. And importantly we also recognised that Mr Barroso has always been steadfast in his commitment to the Atlantic alliance and to a strong partnership with the United States of America.</p><p>
</p><p>The influence of the ECR in this matter was pivotal. The group that our opponents had said would be a marginal player is already a decisive force in the European Parliament.  We have succeeded in taking control of the crucial Internal Market Committee, where I know my colleague Malcolm Harbour, its new chairman, will relish taking our Conservative agenda forward in this key area.  Across the board, we also  hold more key positions than ever before.</p><p>
</p><p>We are the first euro-realist group in the European Parliament – neither blindly in favour of everything done by the European Union nor unthinkingly opposed. We are not against European cooperation where it is useful and in the UK interest.  But we are against big government – at all levels. We are sceptical of yet more government interference and intervention in our lives.</p><p>
</p><p>Of course, Labour believes the solution to every problem is more government. The Liberal Democrats believe the solution to every problem is more Europe.</p><p>
</p><p>On the other hand, the ECR believes that individuals, families, communities and voluntary organisations should be supported in tackling the problems we face, but with government action only where necessary. LESS of it not MORE of it.</p><p>
</p><p>We want a Europe with a light touch; not the ever more centralised and powerful European Union foreseen in the Lisbon Treaty.</p><p>
</p><p>The Conservative Party and our allies in the ECR offer a fresh, modern vision of a reformed European Union: more open, transparent, and democratic; a European Union which delivers value for money.</p><p>
</p><p>We will not give up the fight for this vision of Europe.</p><p>
</p><p>Despite all the talk we heard from Gordon Brown last week about ‘fighting for Britain’, we know he is a man who has built a career on avoiding fights.</p><p>
</p><p>He wanted to replace Tony Blair earlier but did not dare to challenge him openly; he wanted to be elected Labour leader but didn’t dare to face any other candidates in the race; he wanted his own mandate as Prime Minister but didn’t dare to call for an early election, and of course he wanted Britain to endorse the Lisbon Treaty but didn’t dare to call the referendum he had promised.</p><p>
</p><p>It is the ultimate betrayal of the trust of the British people and Gordon Brown cannot be allowed to get away it.</p><p>

Kaminski: Barroso is the right man for the job,16-09-2009,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,235,"<p>
	</p><p>Commenting on the re-election of President Barroso for the post of Commission President, Michal Kaminski MEP, Chairman of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group in the European Parliament, said:</p><p>
</p><p>“While he is not perfect and we do not agree on everything, I am confident that he European Parliament has elected the right person for the job.</p><p>
</p><p>“President Barroso has been elected as a centre-right President of the Commission and he must deliver a centre-right agenda in the European Union.</p><p>
</p><p>“The scheming and manoeuvring by the socialist group in the European Parliament has shown their true colours. Whilst the centre-right has put its differences aside and chosen the man who we think can deliver leadership for the European Union at this difficult time, the socialists have played party political games. If the socialists had their way, the EU would have a political vacuum.</p><p>
</p><p>“President Barroso has won an absolute majority so there can be no claims that he lacks legitimacy. Such an overwhelming endorsement shows that the centre-right is seriously in the driving seat in the European Union.</p><p>
</p><p>“The ECR Group was formed to fight federalism and we will continue to oppose Mr Barroso’s agenda to integrate Europe politically.

Michał Kamiński Speech on the reelection of José Manuel Barroso as European Commission President,16-09-2009,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,555,"<p>
	</p><p>The European Conservatives and Reformists Group will support President Barroso. We will do so not because we agree with the President in every matter. There are many views, which we do not share. Fist, I will mention President Barroso’s enthusiastic support for the Lisbon Treaty. We do not subscribe to this enthusiastic support. But we do share the aversion and condemnation that the President has expressed toward all forms of nationalism and nationalistic egoism. Europe, our continent, which we want to continue to live in peace, has experienced a sea of tragedies at the hands of nationalistic chauvinism. We thank God that today we are living in a peaceful Europe.</p><p>
</p><p>We disagree will several points raised by President Barroso. It is our right to disagree and we will defend this right, although there are those who constantly question the simple fact that the people of Europe have chosen the European Conservatives and Reformists. And I promise you that they will continue to choose us. We will be here and our voices will be heard. For this reason – on behalf of our voters – we have the right to grant our support to the President in his difficult mission. I am very glad to hear that this Commission, the new Commission under the leadership of President Barroso, will direct its focus on our efforts to overcome the economic crisis. This is incredibly important and we are pleased that the ambitious program presented by the President seems to be genuinely aimed at the most important sectors where action is needed. This shows the importance of cooperation among the nations of Europe. This crisis affects everyone regardless of the structure and economy; regardless of the region in Europe where our countries are located. The crisis affects all of us, which is why we must fight it together.</p><p>
</p><p>Mr. President, while granting you support on behalf of our group, I would like to appeal to you that in the upcoming months Europe does not remain indifferent to events taking place in global politics. I must admit that, in my opinion, one of the most important tests for the Western World is the current situation in Iran. Iran is a country that does not hide its nuclear ambitions. The President of this country not only denies the horrific crime of the Holocaust, but threatens Israel with destruction. I believe that this kind of behaviour should have no place and cannot be accepted in the modern democratic world. Our group expects that the European Commission, which you preside, will firmly oppose the current undemocratic procedures and undemocratic policies of the current regime in Iran, which are aimed at our greatest ally in the Middle East, aimed at the state of Israel. We also anticipate that in foreign policy – and I am glad that the statements of Mr. Barroso underline this – the European Union will be the flag-bearer of individual rights and promote our common European values, also outside our borders.</p><p>
</p><p>We expect that in this difficult task that you are undertaking, in which you were not free of mistakes in the last tenure (although no one who deals with politics can be completely free of error, an unfortunate reality), you will hold high the flag of European values and will work for a Europe that embodies unity and solidarity. Thank you.</p><p>

World Summit on Counter-Terrorism: Terrorism’s Global Impact,07-09-2009,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,1348,"<p>
	</p><p>Distinguished Guests,</p><p>
Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><p>
</p><p>It is an extraordinary pleasure and privilege to speak to you today about the global impact of terrorism. The International Institute for Counter-Terrorism has been at the forefront of the struggle against terrorism and I am honored to speak among the world’s greatest experts and gain such invaluable insight into this timely matter.</p><p>
</p><p>As a Member of the European Parliament – the only multinational parliamentary assembly in the world elected by universal suffrage and, since June 1979, the European Union’s only directly elected institution – I have been chosen to protect the interest of all citizens of the European Union. I believe that first and foremost, my duty is to ensure their security and protect the principle on which the EU was founded: freedom. But today our freedom is under attack because terrorism remains the single greatest threat to our way of life. We are faced with an enemy that embodies everything that the united Europe has denounced: where we see liberty and individual freedom, the terrorists of militant Islam see a threat to their misinterpreted religious dogmas; while we seek to protect the lives of the innocent, they do not hesitate to brutally take them away; while we open our borders and free ourselves of discrimination and intolerance, they voluntarily enslave themselves within the bounds of hatred. The attacks in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005 and the bomb plots uncovered in the United Kingdom in 2006 and Germany in 2007, prove that Europe is in constant danger. Although the perils of terrorism should not be underestimated, Europe will never succumb to fear or intimidation because, luckily, it can rely on its closest ally: Israel.</p><p>
</p><p>This brave nation remains the only democratic state in the Middle East. It respects the rights of minorities; all forces within the political spectrum are represented in its national assembly. For over half a century, the state of Israel has struggled to defend our civilization based on Judeo-Christian values. And because Western civilization has been the source of human progress – and the foundation of the principles we cherish – we are forever in your debt. But our gratitude cannot be limited to words. Today, the battle line in the war to uphold Western values is in Israel. This is why we owe it our full support.</p><p>
</p><p>Many of the distinguished security experts at this conference have spoken about the practical measures of counter-terrorism. I believe that these measures have to be met with an adequate level of unwavering political support. Our fight must be accompanied with determined political will and action. As President of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, I am proud to lead a Group that is dedicated to Israel and our mutual cause. We are aware that the threat of terrorism in the European Union has both an external and internal aspect – both have to be addressed. Internally, the EU is threatened both by those who seek to use indiscriminate violence to achieve political means and by those whose make excuses for their actions. Even within the European Parliament we hear the voices of those who pretend to condemn these acts of murder, but who supply the butchers with justifications for their barbaric crimes. There are those in Europe who fall victim to moral relativism and rationalize the killing of innocent lives with the suffering that others may have experienced. Such excuses are unacceptable. Although the European Union has adopted a policy that promotes democracy, dialogue and good governance to tackle causes of radicalization, we must firmly underline that the roots of Islamic terrorism are not in the West. Nor are the roots of terrorism in Israel. Its roots are grounded within those minds who disguise murder as martyrdom. The roots of terrorism are evil and totalitarian ideologies that have no boundaries. In Europe, as in other parts of the world, terrorism is no longer a threat from abroad. It is increasingly “home-grown”. It uses our devotion to freedom, the rule of law, and the protection of human rights to hide among us. Our analysis suggests that parts of the European Union are seen by terrorist groups as safe bases from which to plan and execute operations. With the help of Israel, the EU should adapt to this growing menace. Europe’s policy on counter-terrorism needs to be reexamined.</p><p>
</p><p>In 2005, the Council of the European Union had outlined “The European Union Counter-Terrorism Strategy.” Its purpose was to contribute to global security and build a safer world. To combat terrorism, the EU had adopted the following objectives: increase cooperation with third countries (especially in North Africa, the Middle East and South-East Asia) and provide them with assistance; respect human rights; prevent new recruits to terrorism; better protect potential targets; investigate and pursue members of existing networks; improve capability to respond to and manage the consequences of terrorist attacks. The EU proposed four pillars to fight terrorism. These include: “prevent”, “protect”, “pursue” and “respond”. These policies have been effective in some areas. Working together in the EU has allowed Member States to improve the collection and analysis of information and intelligence, make collective policy responses to the terrorist threat, and making better use of the capability of EU bodies including Europol and Eurojust. Unfortunately, experts have pointed out that overall the EU has not been able to pursue a coherent counter-terrorism policy. This policy is described as “fragmented” due – in part – to the EU’s own intra-institutional structure. But it is also hindered by the EU’s perception of the terrorist threat. As I had pointed out, Europe’s internal threat is often unconnected with global terrorist networks. This brings us back to the roots of terrorism. Too often, we hear that social conditions are the source of terrorist attacks. This conception is dead wrong. Although we acknowledge that poor and failed states are sometimes breeding grounds for terrorists because individuals may become more prone to radical ideas, the EU’s financial commitment to third countries is not enough to combat terrorism. Overemphasis on prevention – in the purely economic sense – underestimates the real source of the threat, which is the ideology of Islamic totalitarianism.</p><p>
</p><p>Unless we stop them, followers of this ideology – like those of totalitarian ideologies in the 20th century – will stop at nothing to achieve their goal. Their deadly plans are facilitated by regimes that provide them with funding, training, and ideological support. And yet, efforts in the Europe Union to call our enemies by their name are often met with contempt. Unfortunately, Europeans frequently need to be reminded of their tragic past. One week ago, we marked the 70th anniversary of the beginning of the Second World War. We were reminded that – if left unchecked – evil ideologies can bring about colossal suffering. I come from a country that was the first to experience the destructive aggression of totalitarian regimes. Because of the war, 6 million Polish citizens were killed – half of them of the Jewish faith. But we endured and finally overcame both fascism and communism. If we are to overcome the threat from Islamic totalitarianism and defeat the ideology that breeds terrorists, then Europe and Israel must stand as one. If our objective is to defend Judeo-Christian values and ensure the individual freedoms of all our citizens, Europe and Israel must be united in this war.</p><p>
</p><p>Our cooperation is essential to effectively combat terrorism. This threat has no borders, which is why the EU and Israel must advance joint antiterrorism policies. Our enemies prey on the indifference of individuals and on misconceptions about the sources of terrorism. As a means to undermine the susceptibility of individuals to extreme ideas, the EU remains committed to promote good governance, democracy, education and economic prosperity through Community and Member State assistance programs. However, we must work together to effectively communicate to our citizens the true roots of the menace of terrorism. Because we are allies, we must also make it clear that any threat to Israel endangers Europe itself. The European Conservatives and Reformists Group will continue to be a voice for Israel within the European Parliament and all of Europe.</p><p>

Outcome of the European Council (18-19 June 2009) – Term in office of the Czech Presidency (debate),15-07-2009,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,490,"<p>
	</p><p>Jan Zahradil, on behalf of the ECR Group. – (CS) Prime Minister, Commission President, it is a great honour for me to be able to stand up today as the first speaker from the many new groupings of European conservatives and reformers and also as a Czech MEP talking about the Czech Presidency. However, I will be speaking as a Member of the European Parliament and not just from a narrow national perspective. At the same time, I will be speaking as a representative of my group and therefore I will take account of its political priorities. I have already had an opportunity to speak at the plenary session in January, when Czech Prime Minister Topolánek presented the priorities of the Czech Presidency here, and I am speaking today as Czech Prime Minister Fischer submits the report on what the Czech Republic has achieved.</p><p>
</p><p>
I do not mention this by chance. I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Czech Government has succeeded in preserving both the political and the organisational continuity of the Presidency, despite the collapse of the Government, which was the result purely of internal political factors. I would like at this point to applaud the tone of the Prime Minister’s speech, as it was exactly the tone of the Czech Presidency itself, matter-of-fact and results-orientated. In my opinion, some of the critical assessments were based on the subjective feelings of certain European representatives or media figures and have contributed nothing to our much-vaunted European cohesion, belonging instead to private political campaigns targeted at domestic audiences.</p><p>
</p><p>I would now like to turn to the three priorities of the Czech Presidency. In relation to the economy I would like to emphasise again that the Czech Republic has succeeded in heading off an ominous wave of national protectionist measures which would have seriously undermined the fundamental values of European integration and particularly the principles of the unified single market. Concerning energy policy, the issue of secure and maintainable supplies for the energy sector proved to be a well chosen theme. In the first days of the Czech Presidency an imminent crisis over gas supplies was successfully warded off, bearing in mind of course that any real progress over this issue will require long-term strategic measures, including diversification of supply and liberalisation of the internal energy market. From the symbolic perspective of the other aim of EU foreign relations I would like to emphasise the summits with major global players, in other words the EU-US summit, which reaffirmed the fundamental importance of transatlantic relations, and also the EU-Russia summit and the EU-China summit. I would also like to stress the importance of the Eastern Partnership initiative and its implementation. In conclusion, I believe that the Czech Presidency can be summed up, on the whole, as providing proof that medium-sized countries and so-called new Member States can manage such a role with honour and to a high standard.</p><p>

Timothy Kirkhope: European Election Campaign Launch,18-05-2009,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,607,"<p>
	</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Rawstenstall, Rossendale and Darwin.</p><p> </p><p>
</p><p>Its great to be here in the North West for the launch our European election campaign with our Party leader and our European spokesman in the Shadow Cabinet, Mark Francois.</p><p> </p><p>
</p><p>I would like to introduce our excellent team of MEPs and candidates here in the North West, headed by Sir Robert Atkins, with Saj Karim, Jacqui Foster Alex Williams, Greg Morgan and Peter Wilding.</p><p>
</p><p>I am also particularly delighted to welcome to our launch my good friend from Northern Ireland Jim Nicholson MEP together with David Campbell, the Chairman of the Ulster Unionist Party. Jim is standing as the joint UUP/Conservative Party candidate in Northern Ireland.</p><p>
</p><p>One of our ambitions in these elections is to be the only Party in the European Parliament representing every part of the United Kingdom.</p><p>
</p><p>In Belfast last week it was great to see for myself the really positive response our campaign is getting there.</p><p>
</p><p>Today we are here to launch today a comprehensive Manifesto for Change in Europe.</p><p>
</p><p>Europe must change if it is to be able to address the tasks that we and our partners will demand of it now and in the future.</p><p>
</p><p>To confront the great global challenges we face: climate change; global poverty; globalisation. More than ever, in the current economic climate, Europe must become more competitive and a place where businesses can be started, grow and create jobs.</p><p>
</p><p>To do this, we want to bring Europe closer to its people. That is why we are campaigning in this election for a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty – the referendum Labour promised but has never delivered.</p><p>
</p><p>We are campaigning for the retention of our opt-out from the Working Time Directive, which Labour MEPs oppose, but which affects three million workers in this country and many thousands of businesses, large and small.</p><p>
</p><p>Our record shows that only Conservative MEPs can be trusted to deliver on our pledges; to deliver for Britain. Be in no doubt, only Conservative MEPs have consistently advanced this country’s interests in the European Parliament. And only the Conservatives have consistently stood up for change in Europe.</p><p>
</p><p>We should be under no illusion all politicans have been under the spotlight in the last week or so. We know that trust in politics has been damaged. That is why David Cameron and I have agreed to set out today, in pledge form, our commitment to the British people – in terms of ethics and transparency, as well as our policy.</p><p>
</p><p>The pledges summarise our main manifesto commitments in this election. They also include the key elements of the Conservative MEPs’ Right to Know expenses regime which has been enforced and is available to the public for the last six months. David and I agreed that Conservative MEPs would lead change in the European Parliament over the way in which expenses issues were dealt with.</p><p>
</p><p>We are setting the standards for other parties to follow. As Leader of the Conservative MEPs, I will now sign our pledge: our commitment to the British people.</p><p>
</p><p>May I now invite our candidates representing all parts of the UK to sign on behalf of their teams.</p><p>
</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen, in everything that has happened in the political arena recently, only David Cameron has shown true leadership- the leadership the country demands. He has shown a clear understanding of what needs to change – and of how to make that change happen.</p><p>
</p><p>While Gordon Brown has dithered and prevaricated, our Party leader has been decisive and resolute.</p><p>
</p><p>It gives me great pleasure to introduce the man who embodies the change our politics needs – David Cameron.</p><p>
