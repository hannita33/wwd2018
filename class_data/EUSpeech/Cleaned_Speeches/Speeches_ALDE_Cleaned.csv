Intervention of Guy Verhofstadt during the Conference of Presidents open to all Members on the Conclusions of the last European Council - 4 November 2014,05-11-2014,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,393,"<p>Today is a little like a change of the guard. The outgoing chairman of the European Council Herman van Rompuy whom I would like to salute for his work and the New President of the Commission whom I would very much like to salute for his work to come.</p><p>This meeting is about the results of the last European Council. But honestly the only thing that I remember is yet another Cameron incident. Under UKIP pressure he is creating a crisis at each European summit. He must realise that voters always prefer the original to the copy.</p><p>Cameron’s latest copy of UKIP idea, imposing quotas for EU citizens, is completely crazy. In opposition to one of the basic rules of the Union – free movement. But I must say – and this is very rare – that for once I actually agree with Cameron on the crisis he provoked in the last Council. The increased payment by the UK and other member states to the EU budget.</p><p>Cameron is right. The current system doesn’t work. State contributions with end of year top up don’t work. Obliging the Commission to ask for more money to countries already in difficulties at the end of the year is crazy. And the only way forward is to have own resources for the Union – and no longer state contributions.</p><p>But besides the outcome of the last European Council, I like to speak about the start of the new Commission.</p><p>I saw Mr President your new website and the new colourful banner on the Barlaymont building. ‘A new start for Europe’. Well let’s hope.</p><p>For my Group such a new start means one single thing : that six years after the USA, we finally launch a European stimulus and recovery act.</p><p>You know what they did ? Directly after the 2008 crisis, they launched the Stimulus and Recovery Act mobilizing over 800 billion dollars for infrastructure works, education, health, energy and federal tax incentives for families and small businesses. And today they are growing again at more than 2 %.</p><p>And that is completely different than repackaging 100 billion every year from the European budget and the EIB over three years.</p><p>My Group will present in the next weeks our own proposal for a real European stimulus and recovery package.</p><p>After the lost decade we have just lived through – we cannot loose yet another one.</p>",today littl like chang guard outgo chairman european council herman van rompuy would like salut work new presid commiss would much like salut work come meet result last european council honest thing rememb yet anoth cameron incid ukip pressur creat crisi european summit must realis voter alway prefer origin copi cameron latest copi ukip idea impos quota eu citizen complet crazi opposit one basic rule union free movement must say rare actual agre cameron crisi provok last council increas payment uk member state eu budget cameron right current system doesn work state contribut end year top work oblig commiss ask money countri alreadi difficulti end year crazi way forward resourc union longer state contribut besid outcom last european council like speak start new commiss saw mr presid new websit new colour banner barlaymont build new start europ well let hope group new start mean one singl thing six year usa final launch european stimulus recoveri act know direct crisi launch stimulus recoveri act mobil billion dollar infrastructur work educ health energi feder tax incent famili small busi today grow complet differ repackag billion everi year european budget eib three year group present next week propos real european stimulus recoveri packag lost decad live cannot loos yet anoth one,en

Rede von Guy Verhofstadt anläßlich des FDP Europakongresses in München,23-06-2013,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,1182,"<p>Liebe Nadja, liebe Freunde,</p><p>sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,</p><p>wirklich, es ist mir eine große Freude hier in München zu sein und an dem Europakongress teilzunehmen.</p><p>Aus zwei Gründen: Es ist das erste Mal, dass ich auf einem FDP Kongress spreche.</p><p>Aber vor allem, liebe Freunde, ist es mir eine Ehre die Bühne zu teilen mit einem großartigen Europäer. Ein großer Liberaler. Hans-Dietrich Genscher.</p><p>Herr Genscher, Sie müssen wissen, dass Sie ein Vorbild für uns alle sind. Sie sind der lebende Beweis dafür, dass unsere Gegner Unrecht haben. Unsere Gegner sagen - und das wiederholen sie jeden Tag -, dass es an zu viel Liberalismus, zu viel Marktwirtschaft liegt, dass wir in Schwierigkeiten stecken. Dass wir uns inmitten einer Krise befinden. Unsere Gegner machen Europa gleichzeitig für alles  andere Übel der Welt verantwortlich.</p><p>Nun, meine Damen und Herren, liebe Freunde, unsere Gegner liegen falsch. </p><p>Wir stecken nicht inmitten einer Krise wegen zu viel Liberalismus, nicht wegen zu viel Marktwirtschaft. Sondern wegen zu wenig Liberalismus. Zu wenig Marktwirtschaft. Und wir sind auch nicht in dieser Krise wegen zu viel Europa, zu viel Europäischer Union, sondern wegen zu we(e)nig Europa, zu wenig Europäische Union.</p><p>Ja, die Europäische Union heute ist nicht liberal genug. Wir müssen den Binnenmarkt vollenden. Wir müssen ein digitales Europa schaffen. Wir müssen so schnell wie möglich ein transatlantisches Freihandelsabkommen abschließen.</p><p>Nein, es ist nicht richtig, dass die Finanzkrise bewiesen hat, dass die Liberalen falsch liegen. </p><p>Liberalismus ist kein wilder Kapitalismus.</p><p>Liberalismus ist nicht die Abwesenheit eines Schiedsrichters, eines Staates oder staatlicher Autorität.</p><p>Liberale wissen ganz genau, dass es Regeln geben muss.</p><p>Ein Markt ohne Regeln ist keine Freihandelszone, sondern ein Dschungel. Ein Dschungel, in dem das Recht des Stärkeren Vorrang hat. </p><p>Aber liebe Freunde, wir brauchen nicht nur mehr Liberalismus für unsere Wirtschaft.</p><p>Wir müssen auch unsere Gesellschaft mit unseren liberalen Prinzipien und liberalen Werten untermauern.</p><p> Nehmen wir Ungarn zum Beispiel. Es ist schlichtweg nicht akzeptabel, dass in einem unserer Mitgliedstaaten die Verfassung gegen den politischen Gegner missbraucht wird, als Waffe eingesetzt wird, um zu schaffen, was John Stuart Mill das ""dictatorship of the majority"" (""Diktat der Meinung"") genannt hat. Eine Mehrheit, die Minderheitenrechte beschneidet, die das Justizsystem aushebelt, die die Unabhängigkeit des Verfassungsgerichts untergräbt, und Religionsfreiheit einschränkt.</p><p>Bis zu unserem letzten Atemzug, sogar wenn wir ganz alleine da stehen werden, komplett isoliert, wir Liberale werden dagegen kämpfen. Innerhalb der EU, in Ungarn. Außerhalb Europas, in Russland oder der Türkei, in China, in jedem noch so verlassenen Winkel dieser Erde.</p><p>Mit demselben Eifer, und das sage ich ausdrücklich, werden wir unsere Privatsphäre schützen. Wir haben das Europäische Parlament dazu gebracht, gegen das sogenannte SWIFT Abkommen zu stimmen, dass es ermöglicht hätte, persönliche Daten an die Vereinigten Staaten zu übermitteln, ohne Kontrolle. Heute sind wir Liberale die Vorkämpfer im Prism Skandal, bei dem die USA alle unsere Gespräche anzapfen, alle unsere Emails und andere digitale Daten einsehen. Wir können das nicht zulassen, ohne Kontrolle oder Garantien seitens der Europäischen Union. </p><p>Aber es gibt nicht nur zu wenig Liberalismus.</p><p>Es gibt auch zu wenig Europa.</p><p>Und wenn ich ""Europa"" sage, meine ich nicht die Europäische Union von heute, die schlecht regiert wird, die auf Zwischenstaatlichkeit setzt, intergouvernemental regiert wird.</p><p>Können Sie sich vorstellen, wie es wäre, wenn Amerika von den 50 (fünfzig) Gouverneuren der USA verwaltet würde? Kein Obama, keine amerikanische Regierung. Nur 50 (fünfzig) Gouverneure, die sich fünf- oder sechsmal pro Jahr treffen, um politische Entscheidungen zu fällen.</p><p>Würde das funktionieren?</p><p>Ich glaube nicht.</p><p>Nun, dass ist genau so, wie heute Europa regiert wird.</p><p>Lassen Sie es mich noch klarer ausdrücken.</p><p>Nehmen wir Ihr Land, Deutschland.</p><p>Kann man sich vorstellen (ich weiß nicht, vielleicht hier in Bayern...?), dass Deutschland von den 16 (sechzehn) Ministerpräsidenten der Länder regiert würde? Keine Kanzlerin. Keine Bundesregierung. Nur Ländervertreter, die sich fünfmal pro Jahr sehen und Entscheidungen treffen? Einstimmig?</p><p>Das wäre so wie am Anfang des 19. (neunzehnten) Jahrhunderts. Ein loser Zusammenschluss hunderter kleiner Staaten, Länder, Königreiche, Fürstentümer, Grafschaften, Herzogtümer, Bistümer, Stadt-staaten,  Gemeinden, Kommunen .......</p><p>Wirklich, ich wiederhole mich, das ist aber genau so wie wir heute Europa regieren.</p><p>Es gibt nur einen Weg nach vorne.</p><p>Es gibt nur einen Weg, unsere heutigen Probleme anzugehen.</p><p>Und das ist, dass wir mehr Europa brauchen in der globalisierten Welt von morgen. Nur durch ein vertieftes Europa können wir unser Modell, unsere liberalen Prinzipien und unsere Werte verteidigen.</p><p>Nur so können wir unsere Souveränität wieder erlangen, die Möglichkeit erhalten, unser Schicksal wieder in die eigenen Hände zu nehmen.</p><p>Lassen Sie es mich Ihnen ganz klar vor Augen führen, 2040 - heute in 20 Jahren - wird es keinen einzigen EU-Mitgliedstaat mehr geben, der beim G(e)8-Gipfel repräsentiert sein wird. Und es wird nicht Cameron sein, der einlädt. Das kann ich Ihnen versprechen!</p><p>Die Bankenkrise lässt uns we(e)nig Spielraum.</p><p>Der Kern der Krise liegt darin, dass die Banken einfach kein Geld mehr geben. Das ist die wahre Krise. Es fließt kein Geld mehr von den Banken an die Realwirtschaft, an die kleinen und mittelständischen Unternehmen. Und Sie und ich wissen, dass die kleinen und mittelständischen Unternehmen das Rückrat der europäischen Wirtschaft sind.</p><p>Nur eine Europäische Union, eine europäische Bankenunion, eine europäische Lösung kann das wieder hinbekommen.</p><p>Mit einem einzigen Regulierungsapparat, einem einzigen Aufsichtsorgan. Und einem einheitlichen Abwicklungsfonds für Banken, in den die Banken selbst einzahlen müssen. Es kann nicht sein, dass der deutsche Steuerzahler oder der belgische Sparer immer die Rechnung zahlen muss.</p><p>Also, MEHR Europa ist die Lösung. Nicht das Problem.</p><p>Es wäre auch eine Katastrophe für Deutschland, wenn wir we(e)niger Europa hätten.</p><p>""Die Alternative für Deutschland"" wäre meiner Meinung nach keine ""Alternative für Deutschland"", sondern Selbstmord für Deutschland.</p><p>Jedenfalls ist es ja kompletter Schwachsinn, was die vorschlagen, sei es den Euro in Nord und Süd aufzuteilen, sei es wieder zurück zu den alten Währungen zu gehen. </p><p>Lassen Sie es mich ganz klar sagen, was die ""Alternative für Deutschland"" vorschlägt, wäre für Deutschland ein Drama: der Zusammenbruch der deutschen Exportgeschäfte, das Ende des deutschen Exportwunders.</p><p>Und ich sage das nicht nur so dahin. Dafür gibt es ausreichend Beweise.</p><p>Nehmen wir die Analyse der holländischen ING Bank. Die haben sich im Detail angesehen, welche Konsequenzen der Zusammenbruch des Euro hätte. Die Folgen sind klar. Es würde zu einem wirtschaftlichen Supergau Europas kommen. Ein Supergau der Wirtschaft, dessen erstes Opfer Deutschland wäre.</p><p>* Die Währungen der größten europäischen Märkte für deutsche Industriegüter würden um 20% schrumpfen. </p><p>* Die neue D-Mark würde auf dasselbe Niveau wie der Dollar einbrechen, sofort 20% ihres Wertes einbüssen. </p><p>* In den ersten zwei Jahren nach dem Zusammenbruch des Euro würde das deutsche Bruttoinlandsprodukt um ungefähr 10% schrumpfen.</p><p>Ich wiederhole mich, das ist keine Alternative für Deutschland, das ist deutscher Selbstmord.  Und - nebenbei - ein Albtraum für Europa.</p><p>Liebe Freunde, wir brauchen nicht wirklich eine Alternative für Deutschland, sondern eine ""Alternative für Europa"".</p><p>Mit einer politischen Union und einer echten europäischen Regierung.</p><p>Mit einem europäischen Finanzverwalter.</p><p>Und wie ich schon gesagt habe, mit einer Bankenunion, Abwicklungsfonds inbegriffen.</p><p>Wir haben die Wahl. </p><p>Entweder wir bleiben ein loser Verbund von Staaten, die nichts zu entscheiden haben.</p><p>Oder wir gehen vorwärts zu den Vereinigten Staaten von Europa.</p><p>Ich weiß, wofür ich mich entscheiden werde.</p><p>Ich hoffe, das ist auch Ihre Wahl.</p>",lieb nadja lieb freund geehrt dam herr wirklich gross freud munch europakongress teilzunehm zwei grund erst mal dass fdp kongress sprech lieb freund ehr buhn teil grossart europa gross

MFF: ALDE still has reservations on outcome of latest talks,20-06-2013,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,280,"<p>The Liberals and Democrats take the budgetary powers of the European Parliament too seriously to confirm reports that negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework are closed. ""</p><p>At this stage, there is still no agreement between the Parliament and the Council</p><p>,"" said </p><p>Guy Verhofstadt</p><p>, </p><p>ALDE group leader</p><p>. The group will meet next week to consider the Irish presidency's proposals, which are not yet available.
</p><p>Verhofstadt continued: ""</p><p>In this game of inter-institutional brinkmanship, the Council should think twice. Remember that the MFF requires a qualified majority for approval by Parliament. On the basis of the disparate and partial evidence we have so far seen, an agreement has not yet been reached</p><p>.""
</p><p>"" </p><p>Little progress has been made in meeting the EP's demands for the modernization of the budget, which is still oriented towards the past and not to the future, and in terms of flexibility, progress is insufficient. It would also seem, regrettably, that there has been no serious discussion on Own Resources. And to top it all, the outstanding amounts due from the old financial perspective are still not solved as payments for the 2013 budget are not yet guaranteed.</p><p> ""
</p><p>""</p><p>The greatest concern and the most unacceptable is the denial of democracy which the Council has demonstrated against Parliament's legitimacy.

Merkel and Schäuble are condemning the Eurozone to death by a thousand cuts,15-04-2013,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,317,"<p>After more than four years of sustained financial crisis and ad hoc policy measures, the Cypriot experience has demonstrated just how fragile and unstable the current foundations of the Euro are.
</p><p>Following a meeting of the Eurogroup of finance ministers this weekend and ahead of a debate in Strasbourg this week on Cyprus, </p><p>Guy Verhofstadt, ALDE group leader, </p><p>expressed his disbelief at remarks by the German finance minister that, despite agreeing to let the Single Supervisory Mechanism go ahead, no further progress on banking would be possible until the EU has overhauled its Treaties.
</p><p>""Merkel and Schäuble are condemning the Euro to a death by a thousand cuts.""</p><p>
</p><p>""It is nearly a year since EU Heads of State committed themselves to creating a genuine banking union to support the Single Currency and end the toxic link between banks and sovereigns. Cyprus made this even more urgent by exposing the risk that depositors might also be dragged into the quagmire of the crisis as taxpayers and creditors grow weary of bailing out failed and over-exposed banking institutions across Europe.""</p><p>
</p><p>""We cannot afford to weaken our collective resolve now. Europe urgently needs a common bank resolution mechanism to supervise the winding down of indebted institutions and a common resolution fund backed by contributions from the banks themselves in proportion to the risks they take. Savings banks would pay little whilst risky investment banks would pay more.""</p><p>
</p><p>""Draft proposals on the table for such a resolution mechanism aim to enshrine the already established principles of a hierarchy of creditors liable to be bailed-in when a financial institution collapses where depositors are the most protected. But incoherent and irresponsible statements and decisions following the Cyprus debt crisis have done untold damage to the credibility of the system we are tying to put in place.""</p><p>

Speech by Guy Verhofstadt - Intervention in plenary - Spring European Council,13-03-2013,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,582,"<p>Intervention by Guy Verhofstadt</p><p>
</p><p>13 March 2013</p><p>
</p><p>Spring European Council</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p>Dear President</p><p>, </p><p>I start with a request to you. </p><p>May I ask you to raise in your intervention at the European Council the issue of Hungary ?</p><p>What is happening there is an offence against the principles of the Union, an attack against our common values. It is about Hungary but it is also beyond Hungary. It's about Europe. Europe must show that it stands united in the defence of its basic values: democracy, rule of law, fundamental rights. </p><p>I said already yesterday, it is time to take stronger action on the basis of art. 7, to launch an open and frank dialogue with Hungary, including recommendations. </p><p>All three institutions have to take their responsibilities. We with the Tavares report. </p><p>You, the Irish Presidency, may I ask you to put it on the agenda Friday ? </p><p>And if not, can I ask you Mister Barroso, art. 7 also gives you the power to act.</p><p>And don't tell me that we have to examine it first. There is nothing to examine, it is crystal clear. Every breach of the values that have been observed the past two years by the European Commission, by the Venice Commission, by the Hungarian Constitutional Court, have now simply been put in the constitution.</p><p>My second remark is about the Spring Council itself. Mr. Barroso, you have written to the European Council, and I quote: ""We are not yet out of the crisis (...) but we can see that the reform efforts of Member States are starting to bear fruit."" </p><p>Really?</p><p> </p><p>My assesment is different and I take your key data on GDP, unemployment and public deficit and debt: </p><p>In the eurozone, 7 countries are in recession - which means negative economic growth  - and 9 are in stagnation, which means 1% of growth or even less.  Estonia being the exception and outside the eurozone the UK also faces economic stagnation</p><p>Unemployment now. 8 countries have more than 10% unemployment. In two Member States, Spain and Greece, it's even 27%. </p><p>And on public deficit and debt, all countries are breaching the rules of the stability pact. Only two small countries not: Estonia and Luxembourg. </p><p>And outside the eurozone, the UK is close to 100% debt.  </p><p>And it is not only a question of figures. </p><p>In Greece we have the rise of the extreme Right. </p><p>In Italy we have no government and two competing populisms. </p><p>In Cyprus, the banks are failing. </p><p>In Spain, we face a lost generation with 50% youth unemployment.</p><p>In France, in Belgium, in the Netherlands, they need to find new packages of savings. </p><p>Ireland enters in its sixth year of austerity. </p><p>In Spain we have 50% unemployment for young people. </p><p>That's the real situation in the Union and moreover in the eurozone. </p><p>We have really entered in what I called already many times a Japanese Winter, a long period, a decade of economic stagnation, growth between 0 and 1 %, due to a real estate crisis, financial crisis, unsolved banking crisis. </p><p>So instead of examining again and again the forecasts, this Spring Council should develop a vision. A vision for the future. A new solid basis for the Economic and Monetary Union beyond fiscal discipline, with :  </p><p>    </p><p>    - a European economic government </p><p>    - a European treasury</p><p>    - a European redemption fund to lower interest rates</p><p>    - a European Monetary Fund</p><p>    - a resolution fund for the Banking Union</p><p>This Spring Council should be about a new start - and about spring -  about blossoming. </p><p>Hopefully I 'm wrong when I'm stating that I believe this Council will not bear many fruit. </p>",intervent march spring european council dear presid start request may ask rais intervent european council issu hungari happen offenc principl union attack common valu hungari also beyond hungari europ europ must show stand unit defenc basic valu democraci rule law fundament right said alreadi yesterday time take stronger action basi art launch open frank dialogu hungari includ recommend three institut take respons tavar report irish presid may ask put agenda friday ask mister barroso art also give power act tell examin first noth examin crystal clear everi breach valu observ past two year european commiss venic commiss hungarian constitut court simpli put constitut second remark spring council mr barroso written european council quot yet crisi see reform effort member state start bear fruit realli asses differ take key data gdp unemploy public deficit debt eurozon countri recess mean negat econom growth stagnat mean growth even less estonia except outsid eurozon uk also face econom stagnationunemploy countri unemploy two member state spain greec even public deficit debt countri breach rule stabil pact two small countri estonia luxembourg outsid eurozon uk close debt question figur greec rise extrem right itali govern two compet popul cyprus bank fail spain face lost generat youth unemploy franc belgium netherland need find new packag save ireland enter sixth year auster spain unemploy young peopl real situat union moreov eurozon realli enter call alreadi mani time japanes winter long period decad econom stagnat growth due real estat crisi financi crisi unsolv bank crisi instead examin forecast spring council develop vision vision futur new solid basi econom monetari union beyond fiscal disciplin european econom govern european treasuri european redempt fund lower interest rate european monetari fund resolut fund bank unionthi spring council new start spring blossom hope m wrong m state believ council bear mani fruit,en
"Guy Verhofstadt :  ""Sorry M. Van Rompuy  but this is a budget of the past, not for the future. """,18-02-2013,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,356,"<p>Responding today at the European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, invited to the enlarged Conference of Presidents to present the results of the last European Council on the next multiannual financial framework, </p><p>Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Alliance of Democrats Liberals for Europe</p><p>, said: </p><p>""Sorry Mr. Van Rompuy, it is not a budget for the future but of the past</p><p>""
</p><p>""</p><p>This is a budget for less Europe, not more Europe. Let's be honest, this is a copy-paste of the 2006-2013 Financial Perspectives. Yes, it's true, there is a little less money for agriculture and a little more for innovation. But for the rest, nothing has changed. Actually, it has got worse. There will now be more than 50 exceptions, exemptions, discounts, rebates, discounts on the rebates, and other special treatments</p><p>.
</p><p>This agreement, in addition, will increase the budget deficit. I speak of Outstanding Commitments. In 2006, the outstanding commitments represented 130 billion euros which will rise to at least 230 billion euros in 2013, and with this MFF it could increase to over 300 billion! Officially, we have no debt as this is prohibited by the treaty, but in reality, you are creating a debt of 300 billion euros</p><p>!
</p><p>It is also a budget of the past, because there are no own resources. The Commission made a good proposal, in accord with the Treaty of Rome. It was also included in your November proposal - direct funding of the European Union and own resources to put a stop to the endless quarrels between the Member State contributors</p><p>.
</p><p>The only solution is to renegotiate everything. Try to reach an agreement within two years on a new financial framework for the EU that is truly future-oriented. My suggestion is to do it after the European elections, once the new Parliament has been elected. It is unacceptable that the democratically elected Parliament might have nothing to say about the budget that will cover the entire period of the next legislature. This is not how democracy works. There must be a genuine mid-term review clause with the newly elected Parliament and a vote by qualified majority of the Council, as provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon </p><p>"".</p>",respond today european council presid herman van rompuy invit enlarg confer presid present result last european council next multiannu financi framework presid allianc democrat liber europ said sorri mr van rompuy budget futur past budget less europ europ let honest copypast financi perspect yes true littl less money agricultur littl innov rest noth chang actual got wors except exempt discount rebat discount rebat special treatment agreement addit increas budget deficit speak outstand commit outstand commit repres billion euro rise least billion euro mff could increas billion offici debt prohibit treati realiti creat debt billion euro also budget past resourc commiss made good propos accord treati rome also includ novemb propos direct fund european union resourc put stop endless quarrel member state contributor solut renegoti everyth tri reach agreement within two year new financi framework eu truli futureori suggest european elect new parliament elect unaccept democrat elect parliament might noth say budget cover entir period next legislatur democraci work must genuin midterm review claus newli elect parliament vote qualifi major council provid treati lisbon,en

</p><p>Il y a soixante ans Jean Monnet disait, ""Nous unissons des hommes, nous ne coalisons pas des états"". Ça reste vrai. Notre Union n'a de sens que si elle devient une véritable fédération de peuples et de nations. Ce que Winston Churchill appelait les ""États Unies d'Europe"".

Le monde n’est plus une planète de 196 états nations, mais un conglomérat de grandes et puissantes fédérations, empires, civilisations. La Chine n'est pas une nation, mais une véritable civilisation. L'Inde est un continent qui regroupe 2000 ethnies, 22 langues et au moins 4 grandes religions. Les États Unies sont le pays multiculturel par excellence.
</p><p>L'Europe n'a qu'un avenir si elle aussi fait le saut vers une grande fédération. Un empire « du bon ». La civilisation européenne n'est pas une chimère, mais une réalité, qui peut être vu et ressenti de la Volga à l'Atlantique.
</p><p>De plus, comment résoudre la crise financière, la récession économique, le changement climatique. Tous ces dossiers demandent une action commune, une approche globale qui dépasse les limites de la souveraineté nationale. C'est au niveau Européen qu'il faut défendre nos intérêts, améliorer notre compétitivité, lutter pour notre modèle de société. C'est au niveau Européen qu'il faut regagner notre capacité de décider sur notre propre sort.
</p><p>La France a été le premier pays avec l'Angleterre à avoir compris qu'une unification de son territoire, de son économie et de sa gestion publique pourrait être bénéfique. La France a donc la vocation, je dirais même, le devoir de pousser pour une nouvelle intégration de notre continent. La France sais plus que quiconque que comme les paroisses ont disparus dans le concert des nations du 19ième, les nations ne seront plus dominantes dans le 21ième siècle.  
</p><p>Une nouvelle bataille se déroulera vendredi prochain : les futures finances de l’Union. Je ne nie pas les difficultés financières actuelles. Mais est-ce que c’est si difficile de faire comprendre à vos collègues qu'en temps d'austérité mieux vaut mettre en commun les rares ressources, que de renationaliser les politiques européennes comme certaines au delà de la manche le préconisent ? Défense, diplomatie, recherche, innovation. Des dizaines de milliards sont à épargner si on collabore ensemble dans le cadre d'un budget Européen renforcé. Comme il y a aussi des millions à épargner si on veut entamer le dialogue sur la question du siège de nos institutions.
</p><p>Malheureusement c'est l'inverse qui se produit. Un strabisme politique gouverne l'Europe. Pire, c'est une véritable escroquerie budgétaire qui se prépare. En mettant les engagements au niveau souhaité par les pays de cohésion et les payements au niveau souhaité par les pays contributeurs, on crée un véritable trou budgétaire. 60 milliards d'euro. Ceci par des chefs de gouvernement qui nous cassent les pieds avec des leçons d'austérité. Hypocrite !
</p><p>[J'entends dire que ce n'est qu'un problème technique. Faux. Par ces mêmes pratiques la Belgique était devenue dans les années quatre-vingts le ""malade de l'Europe"". 136 % de dette. 16 % de déficit. Ça nous a pris 25 ans pour le corriger.]
</p><p>C'est peut être étrange que je vous le demande Monsieur le Président. Vous qui êtes socialiste: dites non. Disons non ensemble. Non a un cadre financier qui n'est pas sérieux.  Et qui n'est certainement pas à la hauteur de nos défis.
</p><p>Finalement le Mali. Vous avez pris la bonne décision. Il n'était pas concevable qu'un régime djihadiste s'installe à Bamako.  
</p><p>Mais pourquoi on ne fait rien pour la Syrie?
</p><p>Deux ans d'horreurs. Des dizaines de milliers de morts. Des centaines de milliers de réfugiés. Chaque jour perdu à aider la rébellion démocratique est un jour gagné par les insurgés islamistes. Assad tombera, j'en suis sure. Mais ce sont les djihadistes qui risquent de gagner. 
</p><p>Je vous en supplie, donnons une aide humanitaire massive. Etablissons une zone anti-aérienne au nord de la Syrie. Et si nous ne pouvons pas faire cela - donnons leur au moins les armes anti-aériennes pour qu'ils puissent se défendre eux-mêmes. 
</p><p>Vous avez été accueilli en libérateur au Mali. Devenez avec vos collègues européens aussi les héros de la Syrie.

"Keynote speech by Guy Verhofstadt at PARNAS conference ""European Union and Russian Federation: Attraction and Repulsion""",07-12-2012,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,861,"<p>PDU conference</p><p> - ""</p><p>European Union and Russian Federation: Attraction and Repulsion</p><p>"" 7 December 2012</p><p>Keynote speech by Guy Verhofstadt</p><p>
</p><p>Ladies and Gentleman,</p><p>Allow me to be blunt from the start.</p><p>Despite the allegations from the Kremlin and from its ruling clique, Russia is not threatened by so-called Western values of democracy, rule of law or fundamental rights. Nor are the US State Department, the European Parliament, some (unnamed) foreign power, Russian girl-punk band, or NGOs funded from abroad undermining the stability in the country.</p><p>It is the citizens of Russia who are suffocating from the grip that Mr. Putin has on Russia. It is the citizens of Russia who are objecting to be being robbed of democratic choice in the Duma and Presidential elections.</p><p>It is the citizens of Russia who are demanding change.</p><p>Russia is a different country since December 2011. The protest movement which started with the rigged Duma elections a year ago continues. </p><p>An ever-growing segment of Russian society has become disillusioned with the Putin regime.</p><p>While hardly predicted by many Western analysts or Putin appeasers, Russian people simply got fed up and found renewed courage to speak up.</p><p>If the Kremlin was rational, it would have seized this window of opportunity and would have welcomed and embraced an evolutionary path to stronger democracy. The regime could have engaged with the opposition in a true democratic political process.</p><p>But the regime's response to widespread protests was the opposite. The regime has systematically sought to silence and ridicule the opposition using a combination of smoke screen reforms, repression, threats and dividing tactics. Many of you present here today have first-hand experiences of their ways and methods.</p><p>Let me just remind you that this is a country with the State Duma steered from the Kremlin, which, as recently as September this year, contrary to its own procedures, and the Russian Constitution, excluded one of its own members of Parliament. This is a country where whistle-blowers like Sergei Magnitsky gets murdered and his killers receive promotions and protection instead of prosecution and punishment.</p><p>Today the options for the opposition have been reduced to continuing protest. Unfortunately there are also signs of radicalisation.</p><p>The pressure is building in the Russian political system. The combination of repression and radicalisation could easily see political stagnation degenerate into instability.</p><p>Ladies and Gentleman,</p><p>From its inception the EU-Russia partnership was expected to become more than a simple exchange of Russian hydrocarbons for European- made machinery, medicine, food and, not least, luxury goods.</p><p>It was seen as a process of normalising Russia, making it a progressive, modern country where the citizens can live normal and decent lives.</p><p>Today, we are nowhere near this ambition. In fact, we have moved further away on values and norms than ever before.</p><p>By now, the deteriorating situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms is deplored by NGOs, the European Union and the United States.</p><p>While many in the Kremlin might see the European Union in its decline, and indeed, these are trying times for Europe, I believe Mr. Putin might be overplaying his hand and underestimating the growing sense of unity within the EU.</p><p>The EU is closer to a common position on Russia than ever before. For certain, the European Parliament has consistently proved that. We have had a large majority calling State Duma elections neither free nor fair. We have had across the aisle support for Magnitsky list recommendations - largely thanks to the efforts and work of Kristiina Ojuland.</p><p>Similar processes can be observed in the European Council.</p><p>This is in part due to the fact that the “new” Member States are better able to make themselves heard within the EU but also because of the “old” and “big” states, Germany in particular, is growing more critical and frustrated with false expectations and illusions in their relations with Russia.</p><p>Russia's recent accession to the WTO and, more importantly, the WTO rulebook implementation process is also prone to unpleasant surprises. My colleague Silvana will elaborate on that later on.</p><p>Ladies and Gentleman,</p><p>My message here, speaking with my friends of the opposition, is the same as when I speak with Russian officials. When I talk to the Member States, the Council, the High Representative, it is a simple message.</p><p>Our credibility to inspire change in Russia depends on our honesty.</p><p>I am pro-Russian, I admire your country, culture, people and rich history.</p><p>But I do not accept paying lip service to a regime that has no respect for its citizens or the Russian Constitution, let alone its own international commitments.</p><p>That is why, together with my friend, Mikhail Kasyanov, I have initiated the so-called ""Helsinki 2.0"" process, which aims at creating a network of influential and well informed opinion leaders throughout Europe and the United States.</p><p>We want to focus on what Russia already has achieved and signed up to.</p><p>As a member of the OSCE, and of the Council of Europe, the Russian Federation has an obligation to abide by the same democratic rules as all other countries.</p><p>It is not unique, not an exception, not a civilisation on its own. It is a modern, pluralistic, multicultural country, whose people deserve better.</p>",pdu confer european union russian feder attract repuls decemb keynot speech ladi gentleman allow blunt start despit alleg kremlin rule cliqu russia threaten socal western valu democraci rule law fundament right us state depart european parliament unnam foreign power russian girlpunk band ngos fund abroad undermin stabil countri citizen russia suffoc grip mr putin russia citizen russia object rob democrat choic duma presidenti elect citizen russia demand chang russia differ countri sinc decemb protest movement start rig duma elect year ago continu evergrow segment russian societi becom disillus putin regim hard predict mani western analyst putin appeas russian peopl simpli got fed found renew courag speak kremlin ration would seiz window opportun would welcom embrac evolutionari path stronger democraci regim could engag opposit true democrat polit process regim respons widespread protest opposit regim systemat sought silenc ridicul opposit use combin smoke screen reform repress threat divid tactic mani present today firsthand experi way method let remind countri state duma steer kremlin recent septemb year contrari procedur russian constitut exclud one member parliament countri whistleblow like sergei magnitski get murder killer receiv promot protect instead prosecut punish today option opposit reduc continu protest unfortun also sign radicalis pressur build russian polit system combin repress radicalis could easili see polit stagnat degener instabl ladi gentleman incept eurussia partnership expect becom simpl exchang russian hydrocarbon european made machineri medicin food least luxuri good seen process normalis russia make progress modern countri citizen live normal decent live today nowher near ambit fact move away valu norm ever deterior situat human right fundament freedom deplor ngos european union unit state mani kremlin might see european union declin inde tri time europ believ mr putin might overplay hand underestim grow sens uniti within eu eu closer common posit russia ever certain european parliament consist prove larg major call state duma elect neither free fair across aisl support magnitski list recommend larg thank effort work kristiina ojuland similar process observ european council part due fact new member state better abl make heard within eu also old big state germani particular grow critic frustrat fals expect illus relat russia russia recent access wto import wto rulebook implement process also prone unpleas surpris colleagu silvana elabor later ladi gentleman messag speak friend opposit speak russian offici talk member state council high repres simpl messag credibl inspir chang russia depend honesti prorussian admir countri cultur peopl rich histori accept pay lip servic regim respect citizen russian constitut let alon intern commit togeth friend mikhail kasyanov initi socal helsinki process aim creat network influenti well inform opinion leader throughout europ unit state want focus russia alreadi achiev sign member osc council europ russian feder oblig abid democrat rule countri uniqu except civilis modern pluralist multicultur countri whose peopl deserv better,en
Speech by Guy Verhofstadt - Intervention to the World Outgames 2013,04-12-2012,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,820,"<p>Dear friends,</p><p>It is a pleasure to be here together with the Prime Minister and you all to launch the World Outgames 2013 in Antwerp. I am here today not only to launch this sportive and festive event, but also to express my support and firm commitment to this event and its objective, being fundamental rights and equality for LGBTI people. </p><p>It is important on a day like today to look ahead to this event, but also to look back. To thank all those who in the past have worked and fought to affirm fundamental rights. Those who have pushed for social change and political reform. As many of you will know, Belgium has been at the forefront of LGBTI rights. It has been the second country in the world (after the Netherlands) to fully apply equality for LGBTI persons by legalizing same-sex marriage. Legislation then progressed and adoption was also guaranteed. Today citizens and residents - regardless of their sex or sexual orientation - can chose between cohabitation, registered partnership and marriage. I think Belgium is one of the few countries where such a range of options is possible and open to citizens without discriminations. I am honoured to have participated, as Prime Minister at that time, in this positive development for our country. I can tell you that we had to overcome obstacles and resistance to change, but in the end we managed to achieve historic results. ...So let me say, it is not only about Gay Pride here, it is also about Belgian Pride !...</p><p>Since then, other countries have followed our example. Today Spain, Portugal, Sweden and Denmark also have same-sex marriage, as well as Norway, Iceland, Argentina, Canada, South Africa, even some US states. France is debating it as we speak. Other countries are examining similar laws. I think this is all very encouraging for all of us and we can expect the number of countries with such laws to rise constantly. </p><p>However, dear friends, progress is not for granted. Progress only takes place if we continue to make the effort. </p><p>The European Parliament and my Group, the Liberal Group in the European Parliament, have been at the forefront in calling for the protection of fundamental rights of LGBTI persons and in pushing Europe and national governments to follow the path towards equality. Since 1994, with its resolution on equal rights for LGBTI persons in the European Union, the European Parliament has continued to support throughout the years fundamental rights and legislative and social reform, including by calling for same-sex marriage, civil partnership and cohabitation and adoption - years before this could become reality.</p><p>But there is still work to do. My group has called for a European Union Roadmap for equality on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, that is to say, a programme of initiatives and legislative actions with specific deadlines. The European Parliament has adopted this and is pushing the European Commission to come up with concrete proposals. </p><p>On a very important issue, the recognition of the civil status of same-sex couples moving across the EU. We believe - and so does the Commissioner in charge Vivienne Redding, that this is contrary to the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We expect an EU act in 2013 to ensure that all EU Member States recognise the effects of marriage, civil partnership and cohabitation civil status documents all over the EU and regardless of where these have been celebrated, without discriminations based on sexual orientation. </p><p>Within the Union itself we are monitoring and where necessary criticising violations of the LGBTI rights. Because there is work to do at this front. There are worrying, backwards homophobic laws in Lithuania in the making, as there are in Poland, and we should be looking very closely at developments in other Member States including Hungary. We are also following the situation of LGBTI persons in the wider Europe and the world and repeatedly condemning the deplorable situation of LGTBI rights in Russia, Ukraine and Moldova. The group I chair runs a programme called ""ALDE 4  Equality"" that brings MEPs to gay prides where international monitoring and protection is needed. We have been going to Prides in Moldova, Moscow, Warsaw, Riga, Istanbul, Zagreb, often in dangerous situations, to express our support for fundamental rights throughout Europe.  </p><p>Dear friends,</p><p>there is still a lot to do in Belgium, in Europe and in the world for fundamental rights and for equality. It is an impressive work of education, of persuasion, of social change and legislative reform. We have to do it together, straight people and LGBTI people, Europeans and non-Europeans, religious persons and humanists. It is about your rights, but it is also about the right of everybody to love, to express ourselves, to be ourselves. </p><p>It is about the right of individuals to be themselves. And together, we will reach our aim. </p><p>Let's celebrate and continue our fight at the World Outgames 2013 in Antwerp!

Speech by Guy Verhofstadt - Intervention in plenary - Debate on MFF & Budget,21-11-2012,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,515,"<p>Intervention Guy Verhofstadt</p><p>November 21 2012</p><p>Debate on MFF & Budget</p><p>Six years ago Tony Blair, President of the Council, when presenting the new multi-annual financial framework for 2006-2012 said, ""Never again"". </p><p>Never again, he said, must we repeat the negotiations on the multi annual financial framework in the same way.</p><p>But, here we are again. We are still talking about a budget of more or less 1 % of the GDP, we are still dealing with a reluctant Britain. </p><p>The only difference is M. Blair has been replaced by M. Cameron and the Labour party is led now by Edward Milliband, who a few weeks ago, for pure populistic reasons, has made a coalition with the europhobes of the eurosceptic party to make a deal on the EU budget more difficult, if not impossible. </p><p>I will not talk about the details of this budget. Let me be very blunt, the whole debate on a little bit more, or a little bit less than 1%, to me is completely ridiculous. </p><p>First of all, the budgets of member states like Germany, France, .. are not only 8 to 10 times bigger then the European budget, but they increased the last years, faster then the European budget.</p><p>Secondly, the USA federal budget is 24 % of GDP, Switzerland have nearly 12 %. And they are a confederation, not even a federation. </p><p>And we ? We can not even agree on 1 %. </p><p>Thirdly, ladies and gentlemen, if we want to make a real federal European Union, as needed in the world of tomorrow, we shall need a budget far beyond 1 %. </p><p>In fact, we are still debating, we are still fighting, on the budget of the past, of the 20th Century. </p><p>We are not talking about a budget for the future. </p><p>This is not the budget of a federal, genuine European federal Union, the Union we need to overcome the eurocrisis. </p><p>Moreover, a strong European budget is the only way to overcome the budgetary problems of the Member States. The way not to waist money, is to pool money.</p><p>For all these reasons, I 'm asking a mid-term review of the MFF, as mentioned in the van Rompuy proposal. </p><p>Extra figures </p><p>The EU budget was around € 140 billion in 2011, which is very small compared to the sum of national budgets of all 27 EU Member states, which amount to more than € 6,300 billion. </p><p>In other words, total government expenditure by the 27 Member States is almost 50 times bigger than the EU budget! </p><p>To put this in perspective, the average EU citizen paid only 67 cents on average per day to finance the annual budget in 2010. This is less than half the price for a cup of coffee – hardly a large expense given the huge benefits that the EU brings citizens. </p><p>In fact, the EU budget is smaller than that of the budget of a medium-sized Member State like Austria or Belgium. </p><p>You can also look at it another way: the EU budget represents around 1% of EU-27 Gross Domestic Product – the total value of all goods and services produced in the EU – whereas Member States' budgets account for 44% of GDP on average. </p><p>National budgets are NOT decreasing their spending, they are increasing it: </p>",intervent verhofstadtnovemb debat mff budgetsix year ago toni blair presid council present new multiannu financi framework said never never said must repeat negoti multi annual financi framework way still talk budget less gdp still deal reluct britain differ m blair replac m cameron labour parti led edward milliband week ago pure populist reason made coalit europhob euroscept parti make deal eu budget difficult imposs talk detail budget let blunt whole debat littl bit littl bit less complet ridicul first budget member state like germani franc time bigger european budget increas last year faster european budget second usa feder budget gdp switzerland near confeder even feder even agre third ladi gentlemen want make real feder european union need world tomorrow shall need budget far beyond fact still debat still fight budget past th centuri talk budget futur budget feder genuin european feder union union need overcom eurocrisi moreov strong european budget way overcom budgetari problem member state way waist money pool money reason m ask midterm review mff mention van rompuy propos extra figur eu budget around billion small compar sum nation budget eu member state amount billion word total govern expenditur member state almost time bigger eu budget put perspect averag eu citizen paid cent averag per day financ annual budget less half price cup coffe hard larg expens given huge benefit eu bring citizen fact eu budget smaller budget mediums member state like austria belgium also look anoth way eu budget repres around eu gross domest product total valu good servic produc eu wherea member state budget account gdp averag nation budget decreas spend increas,en
"Speech by Guy Verhofstadt to ELDR Party Congress, Dublin, November 2012",09-11-2012,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,1425,"<p>Dear colleagues, dear friends, </p><p>1. I thank Michéal Martin for hosting this congress. I’m very confident Fianna Fail will become again the leading political force in Ireland.</p><p>Why am I saying this, because they are the Irish political party. And Irish means you can be in deep trouble, you don’t give up, you fight back, you manage to find a way out. That’s what Ireland is doing now. Ireland was one of the countries hit hard by the eurocrisis. Already recently, they went back to the bond markets. Ireland is overcoming the crisis through its fighting spirit, and that same spirit will bring Fianna Fail back as well . </p><p>2. Secondly, I want to thank Nick Clegg. Why?  Because of his courage, his enormous courage. Last week in a great speech to Chatham house, you contradicted not only the old europhobes from the conservative party, but also the newborn europhobes of Labour. It was pure nationalism, pure populism what Ed Miliband did. </p><p>Making a deal on the EU budget between his party and the most Europhobe politicians that you can find in Westminster. </p><p>Nick, when it happened, I even tweeted that I missed Tony Blair. And to those who know my relationship with him, this shows the degree of my desperation. </p><p>Nick, it was a courageous speech. Also because of the warning to Prime Minister Cameron. You are right. Cameron’s approach shall lead to the second class membership of the United Kingdom.  A status comparable to Norway, not to say Turkey.</p><p>This would be a disaster. For the Union, for the UK and mostly for its citizens. We need the UK fully inside the European Union.  And to achieve that, we need you Nick. Really, we count on you to rally around the Libdems a strong pro- European force in 2014.  </p><p>Dear Friends,</p><p>Let’s face the reality. We are still in the middle of the crisis. And the European elections of 2014 have to deliver a decisive answer to that crisis. In the 2014 elections the questions will be simple: Will we continue with the policies of the last three years? Will we continue with the half measures we have taken since December 2009? Will we continue to blame Europe? </p><p>One thing is clear. This crisis is not economic, it is not financial. This crisis is political. The fallout may be economic and financial, but the origin is clearly not. </p><p>The source of our difficulties is the absence of a state authority, a real government behind the euro, behind the single currency. A state or a government can exist without a currency, but a currency cannot exist without a government or a state. </p><p>Let me prove this: the eurozone has a debt of 90% and pays an average interest of 5%. True, with huge differences. Nearly 10% interest rate for Portugal yet if you lend money to the Germans in the short term, you even have to pay them. But the average is 5%. Well, the US has 103% of public debt and are paying less than 2% interest rate. And the Japanese - the world record holders - have a debt of 226%, double that of Italy. And they pay only 1,5%, the lowest rate in the world.</p><p>How is this possible? The explanation is very simple. Behind the yen there exists a real state. Behind the dollar there is a federal budget of 24% of GDP. With extensive common policies. And behind the euro - let’s be honest - there is nothing at all. Even a budget of 1% is seen as too high by most Members of the European Council. It’s ridiculous.</p><p>So let's face the reality: the euro is not sustainable, the euro can disappear if we don't create a real European government. A state or government with all the ingredients, all the building blocks, the Americans have put in place more than two hundred years ago.</p><p>That means:</p><p>- a true European government;</p><p>- a true European democracy </p><p>- a real European budget,</p><p>- a European treasury</p><p>and finally, I think, a European bond market, at least a Redemption Fund, that can assure high liquidity and low interest rates. </p><p>In fact, it's as simple as that. Either we do the jump forward or we start printing Deutchmarks, drachma and guilders again.</p><p>We are at the crossroads. Either we become the US of Europe or the UN of Europe. That is the choice to make, UN or US.</p><p>Dear Friends,</p><p>There is only one way to secure that the Europeans make the right choice. That is to strengthen the liberal and democratic family in Europe. The Liberal and democratic family has to take the lead of all pro-European forces. </p><p>Because let’s be honest, neither the PPE nor Socialists have what it takes. </p><p>To overcome the crisis, Conservatives and the PPE want more austerity. Socialists from the other side, believe that it could be solved by more money, by more solidarity. Could somebody tell them that we need both? That we need fiscal discipline and solidarity. Solidarity and fiscal discipline.  That these are simply two sides of the same coin. Without solidarity there is no monetary union. And without fiscal discipline there is no growth possible in the mid- and neither the long term. </p><p>Let me give you the example of Slovenia. Since their entry in the euro they always performed very well. It was the first new member state to join the Euro. They have today less than 60% of the public debt, they have a fiscal deficit very near to the required 3%. In other words, Slovenia is one of the best pupils in the class, but, because there is a “but”, they pay nearly 6% interest rate today. The last time they went to the bond market they borrowed more than two billion dollars at a rate of 5,66%. If they would have done it in euro, they would have paid even more.</p><p>How is this possible? Well, because it is a small market. No one is interested in Slovenian bonds. A problem that would immediately be solved if they could borrow money in a European framework, in a common market, a common bond market, with real solidarity.</p><p>Dear friends,</p><p>Let’s be honest, also in this room there are those who still have doubts.</p><p>Who fear that this would lead to a loss of national sovereignty?</p><p>I think, it is time to move beyond the national rhetoric and embrace the post national future of Europe. I am Flemish, Belgian, European all at the same time. I live in Ghent, I work in Brussels. In the post-national globalised world of tomorrow, big trading blocks, emerging markets and continents such as India, China and the US will lead the world. Our European nation states are far too small to play a role in the world of tomorrow.</p><p>Let me tell you what will be the G8 in 2030? It will be the US, China, Japan, India, Russia, Brazil and .... Mexico and Indonesia. Not a single European state shall be part of it. Not even Germany!</p><p>Nationalists are arguing that the best way to defend our interest is on the national level, by protecting national sovereignty.</p><p>Well, ask the Greeks, the Spanish, the Portuguese what national sovereignty means, what they think about their national sovereignty, do they feel protected today by their nation state ?</p><p>The truth is, that the only way to protect our sovereignty is to reinvent, consolidate and reinforce sovereignty on the European level. Yesterday it was the Ryder's Cup playing golf, tomorrow we must win in the political arena.</p><p>If we follow the nationalists, the populists, the euro-sceptics we become a loose confederation, the United Nations of Europe. Playing no role at all in the world of tomorrow.</p><p>If on the contrary, we want to regain our sovereignty, we need no United Nations of Europe, but a United States of Europe, a United States of Europe that empowers our Member States, that empowers our citizens. That is the choice to make in the coming years, in the European elections of 2014. And the status quo is not an option at all.</p><p>I believe that it is possible to make a force in the European Parliament as big as the EPP and the S&D. And that without loosing our purity, without loosing our liberal values, without loosing our liberal vision. On the contrary, the European Union is in essence a liberal project. A full single market, more free trade, a European democratic government, full respect for human rights and civil liberties that is the essence of our view on Europe. That is also the essence of our liberalism. </p>",dear colleagu dear friend thank michéal host congress m confid fianna fail becom lead polit forc ireland say irish polit parti irish mean deep troubl give fight back manag find way ireland ireland one countri hit hard eurocrisi alreadi recent went back bond market ireland overcom crisi fight spirit spirit bring fianna fail back well second want thank nick clegg courag enorm courag last week great speech chatham hous contradict old europhob conserv parti also newborn europhob labour pure nation pure popul ed miliband make deal eu budget parti europhob politician find westminst nick happen even tweet miss toni blair know relationship show degre desper nick courag speech also warn prime minist cameron right cameron approach shall lead second class membership unit kingdom status compar norway say turkey would disast union uk most citizen need uk fulli insid european union achiev need nick realli count ralli around libdem strong pro european forc dear friend let face realiti still middl crisi european elect deliv decis answer crisi elect question simpl continu polici last three year continu half measur taken sinc decemb continu blame europ one thing clear crisi econom financi crisi polit fallout may econom financi origin clear sourc difficulti absenc state author real govern behind euro behind singl currenc state govern exist without currenc currenc cannot exist without govern state let prove eurozon debt pay averag interest true huge differ near interest rate portug yet lend money german short term even pay averag well us public debt pay less interest rate japanes world record holder debt doubl itali pay lowest rate world possibl explan simpl behind yen exist real state behind dollar feder budget gdp extens common polici behind euro let honest noth even budget seen high member european council ridicul let face realiti euro sustain euro disappear creat real european govern state govern ingredi build block american put place two hundr year ago mean true european govern true european democraci real european budget european treasuryand final think european bond market least redempt fund assur high liquid low interest rate fact simpl either jump forward start print deutchmark drachma guilder crossroad either becom us europ un europ choic make un us dear friend one way secur european make right choic strengthen liber democrat famili europ liber democrat famili take lead proeuropean forc let honest neither ppe socialist take overcom crisi conserv ppe want auster socialist side believ could solv money solidar could somebodi tell need need fiscal disciplin solidar solidar fiscal disciplin simpli two side coin without solidar monetari union without fiscal disciplin growth possibl mid neither long term let give exampl slovenia sinc entri euro alway perform well first new member state join euro today less public debt fiscal deficit near requir word slovenia one best pupil class pay near interest rate today last time went bond market borrow two billion dollar rate would done euro would paid even possibl well small market one interest slovenian bond problem would immedi solv could borrow money european framework common market common bond market real solidar dear friend let honest also room still doubt fear would lead loss nation sovereignti think time move beyond nation rhetor embrac post nation futur europ flemish belgian european time live ghent work brussel postnat globalis world tomorrow big trade block emerg market contin india china us lead world european nation state far small play role world tomorrow let tell g us china japan india russia brazil mexico indonesia singl european state shall part even germani nationalist argu best way defend interest nation level protect nation sovereignti well ask greek spanish portugues nation sovereignti mean think nation sovereignti feel protect today nation state truth way protect sovereignti reinvent consolid reinforc sovereignti european level yesterday ryder cup play golf tomorrow must win polit arena follow nationalist populist euroscept becom loos confeder unit nation europ play role world tomorrow contrari want regain sovereignti need unit nation europ unit state europ unit state europ empow member state empow citizen choic make come year european elect status quo option believ possibl make forc european parliament big epp d without loos puriti without loos liber valu without loos liber vision contrari european union essenc liber project full singl market free trade european democrat govern full respect human right civil liberti essenc view europ also essenc liber,en
Verhofstadt: Sovereignty is better pooled at EU level than lost in a global world,19-09-2012,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,370,"<p>On the same day as the EU reform proposals of eleven foreign ministers and one week after the positive verdict of the German Constitutional Court in on the legitimacy of the European Stability Mechanism, </p><p>ALDE group leader Guy VERHOFSTADT</p><p> made new proposals on how to shape the future of Europe. On the occasion of an event on the court decision's implications organised by the 'Akademie Loccum' yesterday night in Hannover Verhofstadt called in particular for a new understanding of sovereignty: 
</p><p>""</p><p>Today, sadly, sovereignty is too often mixed up with concepts such as 'nation', 'nation-states' and 'nationalism'.  The so-called nation’s ability to fulfil its obligation, to exercise power. (..) The all important Lisbon judgement of the Court states that the “irrevocable transfer of sovereignty to a new subject of legitimation that goes with it (...) is reserved to the directly declared will of the German people alone</p><p>”.  
</p><p>But what about the irrevocable loss of power? Do you not think that in today's world we are in danger of losing power, losing power to globalisation, to the markets, in short, to the modern world. On this huge loss of power, nobody has been consulted. Nobody has agreed. Indeed, the people haven't been asked. People too often are not even aware of it. 
</p><p>So, not a transfer of power, but a loss of power is the risk today. Not ""Brussels"", but a new world order dominated by the BRIC countries is the challenge today. If the Lisbon judgement of the Court is to be taken literally, the German people must be protected not from transferring power but from losing power – and the German democratic institutions, the Parliament and the government have a responsibility in this. 
</p><p>And this is precisely the ""raison d'être"", the reason of the European project. Integrating Europe is a vast project in regaining sovereignty.  It is a project to give citizens – be they German, Polish or even Greek, back control over the world we are living in.
</p><p>Verhofstadt also pointed out to the remarkable Article 23 of the German basic law which states that Germany shall participate in the EU development towards a Union based on federal principles.

The Greeks have chosen Europe - Europe must now make a step towards Greece,18-06-2012,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,475,"<p>Guy Verhofstadt, ALDE group leader in the European Parliament </p><p>said: </p><p>""</p><p>The Greeks have shown that they intend to follow the path of Europe and of change. Europe in response needs to acknowledge this engagement and show good will by adjusting the memorandum that has so far been aimed at salary moderation and tax increases. </p><p>
</p><p>""</p><p>What Greece needs are radical reforms. A modified memorandum should help Greece in making the structural reform it requires.""</p><p>
</p><p>""Privatisation must continue and revenue should contribute to the Growth Enhancement Fund that will break the vicious circle of disinvestment, improve liquidity in the economy and reignite growth.  Furthermore, rather than tax increases, it is a simplification of the tax system and reduction in rates that is desperately needed."" </p><p>
</p><p>""Finally, unused structural funds should be deployed and the Task Force used to identify appropriate projects</p><p>."" 
</p><p>Guy Verhofstadt ended by saying: ""</p><p>All of these elements would form the basis to a coherent credible exit strategy for Greece. Like in response to the euro crisis, too many mistakes have been made and too little steps have been taken. Today we owe it to the Greeks to not make the same mistakes again and provide for a real way forward. But our commitment must be matched by the Greek's to modify their political system away from irresponsible and corrupt practices of the past. Greek voters have given the main parties a second chance. They must not squander it.""</p><p>
</p><p>""Greece however will not get out of the crisis alone if the Union itself does not change. We urgently need to establish a banking union and a credible fiscal union.  A redemption fund for the mutualisation of debt over 60% is also fundamental if we are to give relief to states currently plagued by excessive interest rates</p><p>.""  </p><p>  
</p><p>ALDE MEP Theodoros Skylakakis </p><p>also warned fellow Greeks against the false promises of Syriza and to make a fresh start and abandon the political clientilism of the past.</p><p>""</p><p>Greece must leave behind the clientilist system that is responsible for the mismanagement of the state and the public debt that is drowning the private sector. No solution to the greek problems can be found without giving the opportunity to the productive Greeks to creat jobs, restore efficiency in  the economy and the state and work their way out of this cirisis</p><p>."" </p><p> 
</p><p>Jorgo Chatzimarkakis (FDP, Germany), </p><p>a German/Greek MEP added:</p><p>""</p><p>A national unity government of the two largest parties would be the best option. It would be wise, though, to offer Syriza a share in government so they have to pass the reality check. Nevertheless, there have to be adjustments concerning the time frame of the reform package. Greece has to be treated as Spain;  there are no A or B class Europeans.

This time 100 billion for the Spanish banks. And the markets don't believe us. Monday and yesterday, spreads have gone up dramatically, to more then 500 basic points. And not only the Spanish spreads - but also the Italian spreads. </p><p>Why ?  Are they mad? </p><p>Or colleagues - are we mad? Are we seeing things properly? </p><p>Well, I think we all know the answer.  </p><p>Unless and until we have a structural and global solution to the crisis, we will simply continue fire fighting as we do now. One fire after the other. Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy. Not setting up a systemic answer. Not building a real fire wall that can resist.</p><p>Not putting in place the building blocks, we all know that are necessary. </p><p>First, a banking union - with a deposit guarantee scheme and a single supervisor. </p><p>That means that we have to do now what we tried to do two years ago, when we asked for a single supervisor - and what happened? The Council said no. </p><p>We asked for a deposit guarantee scheme - and guess what. It is blocked in Council today. Council has not even adopted a position. </p><p>The second element is the fiscal union including a redemption fund. The one we will vote for in the Two Pack today. So there is no need for any initiative from the Council or the Commission. You simply need to respond to the legislative proposal of the Parliament. </p><p>And finally - equally important, we need a political union - including a real economic government.</p><p>All these three elements need to move forward. Need a clear roadmap. A timeline. And more important an iron cast commitment.  </p><p>Now, on the 28th of June, and not the day after. With 27 or with 17.  Or less if needed.  An iron cast commitment to save the euro.</p><p>Finally, a word on the MFF. </p><p>A credible Union needs a credible budget. And a credible budget needs credible income. And not a membership fee of 1 %, as if the Union was some local neighbourhood club. </p><p>Our Union is a political project. It is about building a common future. So we need a direct link, a financial link, between our citizens and the Union. </p><p>Not as an additional burden, but replacing the fees paid by the member states. </p><p>For my Group the establishing of real own resources is key.

There is 'no need to fear a more federal Europe',11-05-2012,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,973,"<p>There is 'no need to fear a more federal Europe'
</p><p>by </p><p>Guy Verhofstadt</p><p>Europe needs to rediscover its élan and purpose or we will sleepwalk into disintegration and disunity – warns MEP and ALDE group leader</p><p>The French and Greek elections last weekend both delivered a body blow to Europe's austerity drive designed to rein in national over-spending and reduce the enormous debt mountains that have been accumulating over the past 30 years or more. That Francois Hollande picked up on the anti-austerity theme was probably as much to do with pragmatic politics as ideology. He knows very well that he will not be able to keep all his policy commitments from the campaign trail. </p><p>France is not Greece, but it does not have any laurels to rest on either. It was recently downgraded by one rating agency, has high youth unemployment at 25 per cent and a budget that has not been balanced in three decades. That the people voted for a candidate promising a brighter future, reversing pension reforms, creating thousands of new jobs and re-negotiating Europe's fiscal compact is little surprise - but may shortly be rudely confronted by reality.</p><p>At least Hollande is a democrat and a good European. Nicolas Sarkozy was too when he took up office. His interventions in the European Parliament during the French Presidency of the European Union could not be faulted by federalists. And his energy and dynamism were deployed in the common interest. That is until he found himself facing likely defeat to his socialist challenger. He then turned abruptly to the right in a vain effort to woo the voters of Marine Le Pen. Time and again, EU leaders who experiment with populist messages have only served to strengthen - rather than weaken - the hand of the initiators of such messages. In the Netherlands, Finland, Greece and elsewhere - populist, racist and extremist parties have all benefitted from such heightened rhetoric. Why vote for a copy when you can vote for the original?</p><p>At the other end of the Mediterranean, the Greek elections delivered an anarchic result in which the two main parties rightly got punished for the decades of corruption and clientilism. But the anti-establishment parties that have reaped the benefit and filled the vacuum have largely vented their anger against the EU and international financial institutions that have imposed tough austerity measures in return for bailing them out from certain bankruptcy. The result leaves no party in Greece able to form a government and everyone promising to voters what cannot be delivered. </p><p>So the beleaguered Greek citizen continues to suffer from an inept and self-serving political class that now counts neo-Nazis among its ranks. On the other side of the spectrum is a new far left party, Syriza, which has blatantly and opportunistically capitalised on the country's woes and the tough adjustment plan imposed by external creditors. It is disingenuous of the party leader to pretend he can tear up the bailout conditions, so painfully negotiated over the last two years, and offer a painless alternative. </p><p>The tendency of politicians in both France and Greece to blame foreigners - Brussels bureaucrats or third country migrants - for their country's travails is a telling indicator that the construction of Europe over the last 60 years still remains a fragile structure that can be so easily and quickly overturned by irresponsible and populist rhetoric - leading to a recrudescence of the kind of nationalism that led us into two world wars, in the first half of last century. Growing Euroscepticism across member states must be countered by a radical renewal of those who are convinced Europeans. We cannot afford to become complacent or indifferent to events that are now shaping public opinion. Europe needs to rediscover its élan and purpose or we will sleepwalk to disintegration and disunity.</p><p>Ending the current economic crisis must be everyone's top priority. No stone must be left unturned in finding a solution, even if that means further pooling of sovereignty. Germany for instance is currently deaf to some practical solutions, such as a European debt redemption fund - which would combine discipline with solidarity - because it fears a loss of sovereignty and accepting responsibility for other people's debt. But the alternative - never-ending taxpayer funded bailouts - is surely worse.</p><p>It is too simplistic and economically nonsensical to argue that austerity is wrong and growth is good. They are two sides of the same coin. Governments cannot invest in growth if they are paying huge interest rates on their borrowing to cover their debts. Annual deficits need to be reined in by reducing unnecessary expenditure so that the resources subsequently liberated can be invested in productive jobs and growth strategies. Some countries have more to do than others in this regard but the rules agreed by European leaders and recently enshrined in a political pact on budgetary discipline remain sensible for long-term budgetary planning.</p><p>In this week when we commemorate the speech on May 9, 1950, by French foreign minister, Robert Schuman. The words launched the idea of European integration and pooled sovereignty. His message remains as relevant now as it did then. Europe will not stand still. It will either collapse under the weight of growing nationalism and scepticism or it will recover its sense of purpose, agree to make a qualitative leap in integration in response to the crisis and therefore offer the next generation the kind of peace and stability that we have enjoyed over the past half century. It is not enough to hope that the latter scenario will prevail for there are forces actively working to destroy it. There is no need to fear a more federal Europe, but every reason to embrace it.</p><p>Guy Verhofstadt MEP is leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group in the European Parliament</p><p>

Ce qu'on vit, c'est une crise européenne, et plus particulièrement une crise des États européens. </p><p>Depuis quelques années, l'Europe navigue sans horizon, sans ambition, sans espoir. Apparemment incapable de trouver un nouveau cap, de trouver des solutions durables. </p><p>Ce 9 mai, il faut prendre conscience de notre incapacité de répondre à cette crise, autrement que par la politique des petits pas. </p><p>Il faut prendre conscience de la nécessité d'un grand saut en avant, un grand bond fédéral. </p><p>En effet, cher collègues, l'Europe sera fédérale ou ne sera pas. </p><p>Le choix est aussi simple que ça. </p><p>N'ayons pas peur des mots. </p><p>Une solution fédérale s'impose. </p><p>Une solution qui nous donnera un vrai gouvernement économique. </p><p>Un vrai control démocratique.</p><p>Un vrai trésor européen.</p><p>Un vrai budget fédéral aussi. </p><p>Et pourquoi pas, une solution qui nous amènera un jour une vraie armée européenne. </p><p>On n'a pas le choix.</p><p>Le fédéralisme européen est la seule façon pour nous intégrer dans la globalisation.  Et la seule façon pour négocier d'égale à égale.

Croissance ét rigueur, discipline ét solidarité.</p><p>More concrete, dear colleagues,</p><p>- The fiscal compact must not be changed, but growth must be added to the fiscal compact. </p><p>- The EIB's capital must be increased.

</p><p>The facts are clear. I do not make a habit of agreeing with President Sarkozy, but this time, I must admit that he is right. The Annan plan is not working. The Annan plan is dead.
</p><p>Lets state the facts.
</p><p>More than a hundred breaches of the Annan plan were identified. More than 50 people were killed yesterday as reported by the Local Co-ordination Committees of Syria.

</p><p>Putting military observers on the ground is a waste of time which will result again in the loss of lives.  What will the observers do there? 
</p><p>Observe what we already know?
</p><p>That the plan is not working. 
</p><p>That Bashar al Assad is killing more people. 
</p><p>That Bashar al Assad is ignoring all his promises. 
</p><p>That Bashar al Assad is continuing to commit crimes against humanity.

"Speech by Guy Verhofstadt at the opening of the Liberal Democrat Conference on ""Arab Spring One Year On""",30-03-2012,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,899,"<p>President Mas,</p><p>Secretary General Sijillmassi,</p><p>Ladies and Gentleman,
</p><p>2011 was the most momentous year since the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe.</p><p>The overthrowing of authoritarian regimes across the Arab world over this past year has</p><p>changed the way we perceive the region. It has proved many, to be wrong. Those who</p><p>claimed that democracy can not take off in the Arab world. Most importantly it gave the</p><p>people in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen or other countries the power they deserve. This</p><p>happened suddenly, and we have to admit caught many of us by surprise. Revolutions</p><p>that were inspired by a grass root movement has rooted out dictatorships, demanding</p><p>for political, economic and social freedoms.
</p><p>No one could have predicted the rapidity of change nor the consequences it presents for</p><p>relations with neighbouring countries. There is huge potential for transforming the</p><p>Mediterranean from an unequal partnership of rich, stable democracies in the North and</p><p>poor, dictatorships to the South into a new partnership of equals.
</p><p>What started here in Barcelona in 1990, is now known as the Union for the</p><p>Mediterranean.
</p><p>What started as a process to bring the two shores of the Mediterranen closer to each</p><p>other, now aims to promote common action for common interest.</p><p>All that is of course commendable, but in the last 12 months the Arab Spring changed</p><p>everything. The political, economic and social landscape of the region has completely</p><p>transformed and is still evolving.
</p><p>The European Union invested heavily in its Eastern neighbours as they struggled to throw</p><p>off the yoke of their communist past and strive to adapt to the demands of EU</p><p>membership. We should be no less committed to our southern neighbours. My Group has</p><p>called for a comprehensibe package of support aimed at countries embarking on the</p><p>quest for more democracy. People on the streets of Tunis or Cairo want to see change</p><p>now. Euphoria of the revolution can soon be replaced by disilusionment. Therefore, we</p><p>in the European Union should not be complacent. We need a Marshall Plan for the</p><p>Southern Mediterranean.
</p><p>A bilateral approach with each country, promoting 'more-for-more' principle, but with</p><p>one regional strategy. A strategy for building a Mediterranean Union.</p><p>Not a Union for the Mediterranean, but a Union of the Mediterranean</p><p>By building a Mediterranean Union we make a united effort for peace, democracy and</p><p>the rule of law in the region. And with it will come jobs, trade, growth. In short,</p><p>prosperity.
</p><p>We have made mistakes in the past.
</p><p>We should learn from them. We should not pay lip service to human rights and</p><p>fundamental freedoms.
</p><p>We should respect the democratic and legitimate choice of the people in the Arab world</p><p>as expressed through elections. Islamic or secular, liberal or conservative, as long as</p><p>they stand for peace and provide long awaited change, we can and should work with</p><p>them.
</p><p>Democracy cant come in a day. There shall be more upheavals before the objectives of</p><p>the Arab Sprong are achieved. But we need to persevere.</p><p>To do that we have to pursue three clear objectives.
</p><p>First is to ensure the consolidation of democracy and reform.</p><p>Independent institutions, independent judiciary, representative parliamentarians holding</p><p>an elected government to account, a free press and a lively civil society able to express</p><p>itself and a population uninhibited by the State apparatus. Elections will produce</p><p>winners and losers but it is the respect for the Rule of Law and of minority opinion that</p><p>marks out a true democracy.
</p><p>Second is delivering the dividens of democracy quick enough. The soft economic power</p><p>of the EU has already proven itself and can do so again in rewarding those Arab countries</p><p>that have chosen the path of democratic reform.
</p><p>Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas, assisting development of infrastructure,</p><p>supporting small businesses.
</p><p>Let us not forget that it was the basic desire to earn an honest living that led the young</p><p>Tunisian fruit seller, Mohammed Bouazizi, to set himself on fire in front of the local</p><p>administration out of desperation and protest and in so doing spark a revolution across</p><p>the Arab world.
</p><p>Lets be honest, we in the European Union have a vested interest in the Arab Spring</p><p>bearing fruit. If it fails, the repercussions will be catastrophic not only for the stability</p><p>of the countries comcerned but also pose a major threat to the relatively affluent</p><p>countries of the EU.
</p><p>Third is not forgetting the big picture. An aggressive boost in bilateral relations, the</p><p>implementation of 'more for more' principle, but always keeping in mind that by this we</p><p>are building a Mediterranean Union.
</p><p>A Union of peace, democracy and prosperity.
</p><p>Today, I also want to remind us all of the human catastrophe unfolding in Syria. Bashir</p><p>Al-Asaad continues slaughtering his own people and we have yet to deliver a meaningful</p><p>response for the crimes he is committing towards his own people. At this moment, in</p><p>this conference we are united in support for all those Syrians that are fighting for their</p><p>right to have a better, just and free life. The Friends of Syria Contact Group will meet</p><p>again soon, they know what has to be done. It is very late, but they can still save many</p><p>lives. We need humanitarian corridors, safe zones and assistance to the Free Syrian</p><p>Army. When dictator wages a war against his own people, we can not be passive</p><p>observers. We have to act now.
</p><p>Ladies and Gentleman,
</p><p>Allow me to thank all our partners of Convergencia, ELDR, LI, FNS, and most of all to all</p><p>our distinguished arab friends that have joined this conference today. I am confident</p><p>that this conference will be an important contribution to the agenda of freedom and</p><p>democracy in the Arab world.</p>",presid mas secretari general sijillmassi ladi gentleman moment year sinc collaps communism eastern europ overthrow authoritarian regim across arab world past year haschang way perceiv region prove mani wrong whoclaim democraci take arab world import gave thepeopl tunisia egypt libya yemen countri power deserv thishappen sudden admit caught mani us surpris revolutionsthat inspir grass root movement root dictatorship demandingfor polit econom social freedom one could predict rapid chang consequ present forrel neighbour countri huge potenti transform themediterranean unequ partnership rich stabl democraci north andpoor dictatorship south new partnership equal start barcelona known union themediterranean start process bring two shore mediterranen closer eachoth aim promot common action common interest cours commend last month arab spring changedeveryth polit econom social landscap region completelytransform still evolv european union invest heavili eastern neighbour struggl throwoff yoke communist past strive adapt demand eumembership less commit southern neighbour group hascal comprehensib packag support aim countri embark thequest democraci peopl street tuni cairo want see changenow euphoria revolut soon replac disilusion therefor wein european union complac need marshal plan thesouthern mediterranean bilater approach countri promot moreformor principl withon region strategi strategi build mediterranean union union mediterranean union mediterraneanbi build mediterranean union make unit effort peac democraci andth rule law region come job trade growth short prosper made mistak past learn pay lip servic human right andfundament freedom respect democrat legitim choic peopl arab worlda express elect islam secular liber conserv long asthey stand peac provid long await chang work withthem democraci cant come day shall upheav object ofth arab sprong achiev need persever pursu three clear object first ensur consolid democraci reform independ institut independ judiciari repres parliamentarian holdingan elect govern account free press live civil societi abl expressitself popul uninhibit state apparatus elect producewinn loser respect rule law minor opinion thatmark true democraci second deliv dividen democraci quick enough soft econom powerof eu alreadi proven reward arab countriesthat chosen path democrat reform deep comprehens free trade area assist develop infrastructur support small busi let us forget basic desir earn honest live led youngtunisian fruit seller moham bouazizi set fire front localadministr desper protest spark revolut acrossth arab world let honest european union vest interest arab springbear fruit fail repercuss catastroph stabilityof countri comcern also pose major threat relat affluentcountri eu third forget big pictur aggress boost bilater relat theimplement principl alway keep mind wear build mediterranean union union peac democraci prosper today also want remind us human catastroph unfold syria bashiralasaad continu slaughter peopl yet deliv meaningfulrespons crime commit toward peopl moment inthi confer unit support syrian fight theirright better free life friend syria contact group meetagain soon know done late still save manyl need humanitarian corridor safe zone assist free syrianarmi dictat wage war peopl passiveobserv act ladi gentleman allow thank partner convergencia eldr li fns allour distinguish arab friend join confer today confidentthat confer import contribut agenda freedom anddemocraci arab world,en

Speech by Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt at the CSIS in Washington [2006],28-02-2012,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,2890,"<p>Mister Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><p>Europe's dream of conducting a unified policy has been around for quite some time. I'm not talking about the imperialistic plans for unification hatched by Charlemagne or Napoleon or any nostalgic dream of the re- establishment of the Roman Empire or a Christian Europe ruled by some emperor. On the contrary, what I mean is the democratic dream of a United States of Europe, as invoked by such great Europeans as Victor Hugo or Winston Churchill.</p><p>And yet, the very first person to have this dream was not European, but American - and no ordinary American, but George Washington himself! Over two hundred years ago in a letter to his European friend, the Marquis of Lafayette, Washington wrote, and I quote: ""I am a citizen of the greatest Republic of Mankind. I see the human race united like a huge family by brotherly ties. We have made a sowing of liberty which will, little by little, spring up across the whole world. One day, on the model of the United States of America, a United States of Europe will come into being. The United States of Europe will legislate for all its nationalities"".</p><p>Two centuries later, it has become clear that this comparison between America and Europe was an inspired vision. Indeed, the similarity between the historical development of both continents is striking, and more extensive than most people might imagine. A similar debate and discussion to the one currently going on in Europe took place in North America in the late eighteenth century, when America's constituent states joined together to form a federal state, the United States, to which they ceded significant powers. What's more, federal America gradually expanded from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The parallel is striking: not only are the EU Member States assigning more and more powers to the European Union, but the Union is expanding from the Atlantic Ocean towards the Urals. And the more I read about American history, the more similarities I found.</p><p>Following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775, the thirteen new independent states that had formerly been British colonies formalised their cooperation. Adopting the Articles of Confederation in 1781, they formally created a Union that had already been informally established during their struggle for independence. Those Articles of Confederation created the United States of America, which did not have a government, but did have a Continental Congress in which each of the 13 states had one vote. The Union was weak. The Articles of Confederation allowed states to leave the Confederation if they felt that their freedom and sovereignty were threatened. Moreover, articles could only be amended by unanimous agreement between all the members of the Union.</p><p>During the early years of the Articles, various attempts were made to give the Union more power, since discord had arisen between the states on how to regulate and tax foreign trade. Yet all these attempts failed, due to a lack of consensus. A few important amendments were defeated following their opposition by a single state. This situation irritated the first group of Americans, led by James Madison, who subsequently became better known as the 'Federalists', and in the end, the Federalists managed to convince Congress to arrange a Convention to improve the Articles of Confederation.</p><p>At the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 the Federalists drew up a completely new Constitution under which the Union had far greater powers. One article proved particularly important in this process. In contrast to the unanimity required under the Articles of Confederation, Article VII stipulated that approval by nine of the thirteen states was sufficient to approve the Constitution and bring it into force.</p><p>All this, greatly displeased the Federalists' opponents, or the 'Anti- Federalists', who opposed the Constitution for a variety of reasons. The main ones were fear of the power wielded by a strong, central government and of course the surrendering of power by the states themselves. Given the influence wielded by the Anti-Federalists, convincing America's citizens to embrace the Constitution was no easy task. So it's hardly surprising that in a number of states the ballot was touch and go. Nevertheless, twelve of the thirteen states ratified it, and ultimately, the only state to have voted against, Rhode Island – which had something of a reputation as a rogue state – had no choice but to organise a second vote and to join the Union in 1790.</p><p>However, for nearly a century the United States was in many respects - and despite the Constitution - governed as a confederation, in which the individual states had far greater powers than the federal government. The federal government was especially weak during that period. In fact, it had hardly any departments and the president had no staff, and the biggest federal department in the nineteenth century was... the postal service!</p><p>For federal America, the turning point was the Civil War, after which the federal government gradually developed. As individual states proved to be too small for some business initiatives, the opening up of the Far West, the development of the country's railways and the advent of heavy industry played just as critical a role in the government's development as the Constitution itself.</p><p>In the fifties, 17% of America's GDP went to the federal government. Now, this figure turns around 20%. In 1929, however, the year of the massive global economic crash, the federal government received only 1% of America's GDP.</p><p>Well, the financial resources of the European Union today are exactly the same: one percent of our GDP. There are also clear similarities between the American and European discussion on the Constitution. Some European countries have the same fear of abolishing the principle of unanimity and ceding power and autonomy to a more centralised government. Another point in common, unfortunately, was that it took a war to prompt unification and an economic crisis to prompt the realisation that joining forces was the only way out of the situation.</p><p>Although I believe we shouldn't try to extend the similarities too far, I am also convinced that history teaches us that the further unification of Europe is the right road to take, even if sometimes it proves to be a difficult path, as it is the case today. Indeed, the difficulties we face sometimes make people forget that, so far, Europe's unification has been a very successful undertaking.</p><p>For generations, the unification of Europe has been held up as a major ideal, marking an end to constant wars on the Old Continent, clashes that we could now call European civil wars. Moreover, on the ruins left by two world wars, Europe built durable democracy, prosperity and a decent level of social protection.</p><p>When France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg signed the Treaty of Rome in 1957, they had a specific objective in mind: to develop a close-knit community and form a Union capable of guaranteeing peace and prosperity.</p><p>Right from the outset, the project of European unification proved highly attractive. Peoples from all over Europe wanted to be part of a united continent, especially those enduring military dictatorships, like the Greeks, Spanish and Portuguese. In fact, it was partly thanks to the ideal of a united Europe that they found the strength to embark on the road to democracy and cast off dictatorship, once and for all. Consequently, I think it's fair to say that the European Union has been a factor in turning poor dictatorships into prosperous democracies.</p><p>After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the dream of a united Europe genuinely lay within reach. Back in 1989, nobody doubted the need for the lost sons and daughters in Eastern Europe to rejoin the European family as soon as possible. And that's just what happened fifteen years later, on 1 May 2004, when eight former Eastern Bloc countries plus Cyprus and Malta joined the European Union. So membership remains an attractive proposition, and even now a number of countries are knocking on the door of the European Union.</p><p>One year later, in spring 2005, the Constitutional Treaty designed to lay fresh foundations for the enlarged Europe was due to be ratified by the Member States. That Constitution would constitute an important step for Europe towards the establishment of a federation with its own president, own foreign policy, own single army and so on.</p><p>But as you know, in spring 2005 the Treaty was rejected in referendums held in both France and the Netherlands, two of the founding fathers. The one million dollar question currently being asked throughout Europe is: where do we go from here?</p><p>I believe there are several options. The first option is the “status quo option”. This would entail that we would simply continue without the Constitution. This is easy to do. We would then work solely on the basis of previously concluded agreements. But in that option we continue with a system in which each Member State has a right of veto in the key questions. It makes decision-making difficult for a Union comprising twelve countries, even more difficult for a Union of fifteen Member States, and as good as unworkable for a Union with twenty-five members. This once again became clear in the negotiations on the European budget.</p><p>A second alternative would be the 'pick-and-choose' option. The Constitution would be scrapped, but we would salvage a few elements. The problem here is that everyone would like to salvage something different. So giving everyone what they want would be tantamount to adopting the - recently rejected - Constitution in its entirety.</p><p>The third option is the “wait and see option”. This would involve simply going ahead with the Constitution's ratification and seeing where this takes us. This happens to be the Union's current approach. It is an honourable option because it will entail every country being given a chance to say its piece. At the same time, however, we must bear in mind that a number of countries have already abandoned their referendum, so all we can do is wait and see what happens.</p><p>The fourth option is the “roll-back approach”. In other words to conclude from the no votes in the referendums that people want less Europe and that the Union should therefore be scaled back to become a mere free trade area.</p><p>My personal view is that none of these options are the right way to go. Instead, I'm advocating a fifth avenue. I'm convinced that Europe can learn a great deal from the United States and from your country's response to key economic developments. The United States saw that closer cooperation was the only viable option, to face huge economic challenges as the stock market crash of 1929. That is why I too am convinced that the challenges of today, at this pivotal moment, leave Europe with just one real option: the option of a United States of Europe.</p><p>In our globalising economy, new rivals are emerging in the East, where major centres of development like China and India are undergoing unprecedented transformation. Indeed, within just a few years, Asia has shifted the focus of the world economy. This development looks certain to gain further impetus in the future. After all, in some parts of Southeast Asia, the economy is growing ten times as fast as it is in Europe. Many people feel concerned that these new economic heavyweights are more and more influencing our economy, the price of our fuel, for instance.</p><p>Economic growth in China, India and Japan, in total two-and-a-half billion people, will change the world as we know it. This is the natural run of things. Various European countries - including Belgium - have already understood this and are busily implementing appropriate reforms. Only a few months ago we decided to embark on a fundamental reform of our labour market. By adopting a whole package of measures we intend to get more people to work and also allow them to work longer. To this end, we have once again lowered the tax paid on labour. At the same time we are also investing more in R&D. We've slashed red tape and lowered corporate tax. This is why I'm here in the USA: to promote the new incentives we have adopted in a bid to make investing in Belgium highly attractive.</p><p>With similar reforms European countries are pumping new life into their economies. But these efforts alone won't be sufficient, because what Europe really needs is a genuine European economic strategy. We must establish common socio-economic policies. We must work towards the convergence of rules governing fiscal and social security matters. And we must develop a common research and development strategy to make Europe far more competitive. However this new phase of European integration cannot merely include a common socio-economic strategy. We need also a single European area of justice and security and we must also be capable of tackling crime, terrorism and illegal immigration. The new Europe should also have a real common foreign policy to prevent the Union from being divided, as it was over going to war in Iraq and prevent the kind of indecision that existed when there was a civil war in the former Yugoslavia, a war fought on our own continent. We are still grateful for the help provided by the USA, but as a Union we should have been ashamed. That is why in future we must have a European army, not just on paper, but one that can actually operate in the field, including beyond our borders.</p><p>The philosophy behind all these proposals is the same. I'm convinced that citizens' doubts and uncertainty, as reflected in the referendums on the European Constitution are actually a plea for more Europe, for a stronger Europe. The French and Dutch didn't vote against the European Constitution because they are opposed to Europe or want less Europe. They voted no because today's Europe doesn't provide the right answers to their concerns.</p><p>Consequently, I'm advocating a stronger Europe, a more closely integrated Europe. I'm advocating a powerful Europe that pursues a common economic strategy, a Europe that takes a joint stance against crime, drugs and terrorism, a Europe that speaks abroad with one voice - in short I'm advocating a United States of Europe.</p><p>I hope that all the Union's Member States should take part. But if this proves impossible, all the countries at least belonging to the euro zone should be mobilised. In such a scenario, Europe would comprise two concentric circles: a political core, or 'United States of Europe', based on the euro zone, and surrounding it a confederation of countries, or 'Organisation of European States'.</p><p>Naturally, the political core must never oppose any form of broader cooperation. All countries that wish to join this core, whether old or new Member States, should be able to do so. The sole precondition should be their willingness to work on pressing ahead with the overall political project.</p><p>The questions I often hear from Americans, are: “Should we fear this European evolution?” Is Europe planning to weaken the Atlantic alliance? Does Europe want to become an independent superpower? On the contrary. Only a unified Europe can be a long-term and reliable ally of the United States. It is a choice between the disjointed efforts of twenty-five small states or a single solid partner on which to build. As we did with the European arrest warrant after 9/11, making our fight against terror more efficient. The same applies in other areas, including military cooperation. A common European defence policy makes the Atlantic alliance stronger and more efficient. In this globalized world only the United States and a unified Europe together will have the authority to defend their values.</p><p>Our transatlantic alliance however is not only about cooperating with each other, it is also about understanding each other. On this point there is still lots of work. Exactly one year ago I proposed to organise a Transatlantic Gymnich which is, like the European Gymnich, an informal meeting of the ministers of foreign affairs. President Bush liked the idea, which is why now, one year later, already two Transatlantic Gymnichs have successfully been organised. Now we should go, one step further and make the field of transatlantic contacts broader. The German Marshall Fund is organising the Brussels Forum, an informal, but high level weekend meeting between Americans and Europeans. As Belgian government we fully do support this new and promising transatlantic initiative.</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><p>George Washington predicted that one day the quarrelsome European nations would form a United States of Europe. At the time, no doubt, nobody believed him. But the founder of the European Union believed him. Jean Monnet visited the United States before launching his European project.</p><p>In challenging times the United States of America has opted in favour of closer cooperation. Having done so, not only did it survive, but it flourished as never before. In today's global world, all Europe has to do is follow the same path and strive to establish a 'United States of Europe'. As Bernard Shaw once said: ""We learn from history that we learn nothing from history"". This time I feel sure this won't be the case.</p><p>Thank you.

</p><p>28 February 2012 - Washington D.C.</p><p>
</p><p>""Only a United States of Europe can save the Euro"" </p><p>
</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p><p>Six years ago, as Prime Minister of Belgium, I shared with you my vision for Europe.</p><p>I told you in 2006 that we absolutely needed a United States of Europe.</p><p>At that I was not referring to the dream of Victor Hugo or Winston Churchill. No</p><p>I quoted an American, George Washington.</p><p>Over two hundred years ago in a letter to his European friend, the Marquis of Lafayette, Washington wrote, and I quote:</p><p> ""I am a citizen of the greatest Republic of Mankind. I see the human race united like a huge family by brotherly ties. We have made a sowing of liberty which will, little by little, spring up across the whole world. One day, on the model of the United States of America, a United States of Europe will come into being. The United States of Europe will legislate for all its nationalities"".</p><p>Today, I am back six years later, but in a very different context. Europe is in the midst of a serious crisis. The European Union and particularly the Member States of the euro area, indeed, are in great trouble. For about three years now, a debt crisis is challenging Europe, is challenging the future of the European Union. The outbreak of the so-called Greek crisis in December 2009, was followed by a Portuguese financial crisis in 2010 and an Irish last year. So called technocratic governments were installed in Greece and Italy. More technical in Italy, than in Greece I have to say as Papademos might be a technocrat, but the rest of his cabinets are old wolves of the Greek political scene. There was also a change of guard in Madrid. So without exaggerating, we can say that the euro area is confronted with the most severe test since the birth of the European Union. And we have to recognise, the 27 Member States of the Union and particularly the 17 Member States of the euro area, still fail to combat this crisis effectively.  We are still confronted with growing debts. With rating agencies downgrading banks and countries alike. </p><p>Let me first answer the question, what went wrong? </p><p>First of all, I think we have made a big strategic mistake at the beginning, when we launched the euro. We launched a monetary union, but we did not install an economic and fiscal union. And today we all know that this is impossible. A single currency with 17 different governments, 17 different bond markets, 17 different economic strategies can simply not work.  There never was a currency, and there is no currency in the actual world without a state’s authority. A state's authority to guarantee the economic, financial and political conditions to do so. </p><p>Nevertheless, the European decision-makers thirteen years ago, thought the opposite. Thought that it was possible to introduce a single European currency without the necessary means and instruments to do so. </p><p>Summarised in a nutshell, they thought to be able to have a single currency solely based on two basic rules. First, no public debts higher than 60%. Second, no budget deficits higher than 3%. Do not misunderstand me these basic rules proved to be sound, I do not criticise them. But, the founding fathers of the Eurozone made the mistake not to foresee a public authority on the Eurozone-level to impose them. </p><p>A public authority strong enough to prevent Member States to breach the rules. A public authority with the necessary means and tools to sanction them, to penalise the sinners. </p><p>In fact, the founding fathers of the euro assumed financial and economic discipline within the Member States would be strong enough. But we have to recognise: from the very start of the Eurozone in 2002, Member States failed to do so. France and Germany were first to break the rules. But as long as economic growth was in the air, the Eurozone could survive this, could survive a few sinners. However, following the world financial and economic crisis of 2008, the Eurozone as well as many other countries got into big trouble. All over the world, but particularly in the US and the EU, public authorities pumped billions of dollars and euros into collapsing banks and faltering insurance-companies. For the European Union alone, taxpayers since 2008 granted aid and provided guarantees of a staggering €4600 billion euro, more than 6 trillion dollar. </p><p>At the same time, public authorities mobilised other billions of dollars and euros to save their economies and their jobs. All this was the real cause, I guess, for public finances to collapse. </p><p>This – in my opinion – is the deepest root of the Eurozone-crisis. The fall-out from the financial crisis combined with the absence of a genuine Eurozone-authority. That is the origin of the euro crisis. And not Greece. The Greek crisis is in my view only the trigger, not the cause. </p><p>An other cause of great concern in this crisis around the euro, are the spreads, I mean the unsustainable differences  between the Member States of the Eurozone. A single currency for 17 Member States can not survive if one Member State has a public debt of 150% of its GDP (Greece today), while another Member State only bears a debt of 7% (Estonia). The same counts for fiscal deficits, actually ranging from -1,7% (again Estonia) to -32% (Ireland). </p><p>Naturally the most killing spread concerns the differences in interest rates to be paid on longterm bank loans and national public bonds, ranging now from less then 2 %  for Germany to around 6% for Italy, 12% for Portugal, 30% for Greece. Never have the spreads in the bond market been so high. Before the financial crisis the average spreads measured against the German bund were 19 basic points, today they are above 200. Ten times more!</p><p>But ladies and gentlemen, not only do I think we have made strategic mistakes. The last ten years we also used the wrong method to tackle our problems in Europe. We used a weak method, the intergovernmental method. </p><p>To be frank, markets simply do not believe that independent Member States can produce enough discipline and enough solidarity to control themselves, to penalise themselves and to maintain a single currency. That is what we in fact lack today: discipline and solidarity. What is so striking is that for the first time in recorded history, markets are not asking for more deregulation. No, they are requesting more unity in Europe, a transfer of power to the European institutions. </p><p>The biggest friend of the European integration, this time around is the Standards&Poor not the EU Member States. In their report Standards&Poor have called for more European integration, a real economic government, a real economic and fiscal union.</p><p>To end my analysis of this crisis, I think that we have also to recognise that we made tactical mistakes. What we have seen in Europe is a political leadership crisis that was hesitating taking half-measures, simply reacting to the dramatic facts and events, lacking  a global approach, lacking global vision. </p><p>So this brings me to the essence of my message today:  how do we grasp control over this crisis? How do we overcome what can become a systemic crisis? </p><p>I believe that the salvation of the Euro is linked to the future of the European project as a whole. The solution lies in the rapid promotion of a financial, economic and political Union for Europe, the establishment of a real federal Europe. A Union based not just on discipline, as suggested by the conservatives, nor solely on solidarity, as proposed by the socialists. </p><p>What we need, I repeat myself, is both discipline and solidarity. They are two faces of the same coin. </p><p>We need a strong fiscal pact. We need a common bond market. We need more supra national or federal authority. What we don't need is intergovernmental solution, where decisions are pre- cooked by a few powerful European countries. Who put their national interest above the European interest.  </p><p>At least we have to set up what I call a European collective redemption fund. Originally, it is a German idea. Made by so called five wise economists who advise Mrs. Merkel. It should be a fund of 2.3 trillion euros that mutualises all debts above the 60% mark. A fund that would reduce interest rates paid by all member states - even the triple A countries like Germany. A fund that would be temporary. A fund that would convince the markets, convince them better than half measures that we have taken in the last two years. </p><p>Besides one or other form of common bonds it is also necessary to transform the European Commission in to a real European executive, that sits in the middle of the European decision making process. That’s the opposite of what is happening now, where we increase the power of European Council of Heads of States and Government. What proves to be inefficient. </p><p>As we witnessed, decisions of the European Council take at least three-four months to be ratified. Only taking their full effect after ratification. A ratification process can be stopped by any Member State, moreover by one eurosceptic party in a Member State. </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, we are coping with a financial crisis of unseen magnitude with financial markets reacting within a few minutes. European decision making that takes 3 to 4 months, can simply not work. </p><p>All this a European economic government, a European collective redemption fund, we need to save the euro. These are crucial steps that will bring us very close to my initial dream of the United States of Europe.</p><p>This is the only way to save the euro.</p><p>Let me remember a few facts of how United States did it.</p><p>In 1775, following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen new independent states that had formerly been British colonies formalised their cooperation. </p><p>In 1776, the declaration of independence was adopted by the Continental Congress.</p><p>In 1781, Articles of Confederation were agreed. They formally created a Union. Those Articles of Confederation created the United States of America, which did not have a government, but did have a Continental Congress in which each of the 13 states had one vote. That Union was weak. The Articles of Confederation allowed states to leave the Confederation if they felt that their freedom and sovereignty were threatened. </p><p>Moreover, articles could only be amended by unanimous agreement between all the members of the Union.</p><p>As you know better than I do, during the early years of the Articles, various attempts were made to give the Union more power, since discord had arisen between the states on how to regulate and tax foreign trade. Yet all these attempts failed, due to a lack of consensus. A few important amendments were defeated following their opposition by a single state. This situation irritated the first group of Americans, led by James Madison, who subsequently became better known as the 'Federalists', and in the end, the Federalists managed to convince Congress to arrange a Convention to improve the Articles of Confederation.</p><p>In 1787, at the Philadelphia Convention the Federalists drew up a completely new Constitution under which the Union had far greater powers. One article proved particularly important in this process. In contrast to the unanimity required under the Articles of Confederation, Article VII stipulated that approval by nine of the thirteen states was sufficient to approve the Constitution and bring it into force.</p><p>In 1790, Hamilton, the first head of the Treasury, introduced Treasury certificates after a huge battle with Thomas Jefferson, what was the very beginning of the American bond market. </p><p>And only in 1792 the U.S. dollar was created by the Constitution and defined by the Coinage Act. Only in 1913, the Federal Reserve System emerged.</p><p>So the historic development in the US is quite clear, the establishment of a federal political structure, an expansion of federal responsibilities, then followed by the establishment of a Treasury. Only later came the dollar and the actual federal monetary system.</p><p>In European Union, process took place in the inverse order. We first created the currency and then only now elaborating the economic governance and the political union we need.</p><p>In fact a European federal economic and fiscal Union should have preceded currency creation. However it is not too late, to take our responsibility and establish a European economic and fiscal union, a European Minister of Finance, a euro bond market. All this together can break the European deadlock and can overcome the crisis. </p><p>Only then the markets will know that we are willing to go all the way to save the euro. </p><p>I'm convinced that Europe can learn a great deal from the United States and from your country's response to key economic developments. The United States saw that closer cooperation was the only viable option, to face huge economic challenges as the stock market crash of 1929. That is why I too am convinced that the challenges of today, at this pivotal moment, leave Europe with just one real option: the option of a United States of Europe.</p><p>Ladies and Gentlemen, George Washington was convinced that no matter what, the Europeans will come together and form the United States of Europe. This was thinking outside of the box. Few would have thought that there is a chance for that to happen. But there were those, like Jean Monnet or Robert Shuman who saw the United States as an inspiration. </p><p>In difficult moments the United States of America has opted for more cooperation, more federalism. Having done so, not only did it survive, but it flourished as never before. </p><p>Today, globalisation demands it from us Europeans. Europe has to follow the same path and strive to establish a 'United States of Europe'.</p><p>Thank you.</p>",speech presid allianc liber democrat europ ald group european parliament centr strateg

Intervention by Guy Verhofstadt in the plenary debate on the outcome of the European Council,01-02-2012,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,405,"<p>Chairman, dear colleagues, </p><p>This was a summit about growth, about jobs and growth.</p><p>But in my opinion, it mainly produced words. </p><p>7 pages. 7 pages of good intentions. </p><p>I think that what we need now, are not words, but what we need now are acts. </p><p>Three examples.</p><p>* </p><p>The European patent</p><p>. A major instrument for growth in Europe. </p><p>Already for more than one year, the so needed introduction is blocked.</p><p>And why ?

It's dramatic even, because in the meanwhile, our SME's are paying 8 times more for the protection of their innovations, compared to their American competitors. </p><p>If they really cannot agree, why can't the EU leadership put the seat in Brussels, temporarily, until an agreement is found ? </p><p>As we did with the European Food Agency.  </p><p>So </p><p>acts</p><p> are needed, not words today. </p><p>*My second example: the project bonds.

And still, the end is not in sight. </p><p>Everybody knows that we need </p><p>a structural solution</p><p>. A mutualisation of a part of the debt, in a disciplined way. As launched by the German wise economists, as foreseen in their proposal for a redemption fund.</p><p>Let's be clear to the German taxpayers. In such a solution, it's the bondholders by receiving less interest rates who are paying the bill, and not themselves as it is today. </p><p>So my message to you dear colleagues is clear, let us take the lead in this.</p><p>Let's do better then the Council. </p><p>Let's use the next legislative package to do this.</p><p>It's the only way to end the crisis, structurally, definitely. </p><p>So once again, </p><p>acts</p><p> are needed, not words.</p>",chairman dear colleagu summit growth job growth opinion main produc word page page good intent think need word need act three exampl european patent major instrument growth europ alreadi one year need introduct block big countri cannot agre seat seat colleagu ridicul dramat even meanwhil sme pay time protect innov compar american competitor realli cannot agre eu leadership put seat brussel temporarili agreement found european food agenc act need word today second exampl project bond discuss year start immedi act need word third exampl enorm amount unus money european fund chang regul immedi unspent money use countri difficulti countri recess like portug like greec act need word also case existenti problem face today ok secur new treati fiscal disciplin lower high interest rate spain itali billion euro one trillion euro taxpay money put crisi still end sight everybodi know need structur solut mutualis part debt disciplin way launch german wise economist foreseen propos redempt fund let clear german taxpay solut bondhold receiv less interest rate pay bill today messag dear colleagu clear let us take lead let better council let use next legisl packag way end crisi structur definit act need word,en
Speech by Guy Verhofstadt on Hungary and fundamental rights,18-01-2012,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,590,"<p>President,</p><p>Mr. Orban has not at all convinced me. On the contrary. </p><p>I have here a list of 30 breaches of the Treaty, fundamental questions, serious concerns, mainly on article 2 and 4 of the Treaty. </p><p>Breaches, questions and concerns on the new Hungarian Constitution, on the independence of the Hungarian judiciary, on the new media law, on the independence of data protection supervisor, on the position of the Hungarian Central bank, on the new church law and on a lot of other issues in cardinal laws that recently have been published.</p><p>Let there be no misunderstanding, I did not make this list myself. </p><p>They are simply the summary of all the facts, all the complaints, that you can find in official letters of official international authorities: the President of the European Commission, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the Venice Commission, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Central Bank, the US Administration and more precisely the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. I did not add to the list of all the complaints of Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and of the civil society that are protesting in the streets. These are only official letters, by official international authorities.</p><p>So to say that there is no big problem ? I'm shocked, I'm astonished.</p><p>Yesterday the European Commission launched infringement procedures relating to the independence of the Central Bank, the retirement age of the judges, and the independence of the data protection supervisor. </p><p>But let's be clear. There is more at stake. These are mainly technical issues.</p><p>What is necessary is to check the conformity of the Hungarian Constitution and cardinal laws with the European values: democracy, the rule of law, the freedom of religion, the freedom of expression, equality also. </p><p>I think, besides the infringement procedures, this House, should take its responsibility. </p><p>I call on our colleagues of the LIBE committee to make a report on the basis of article 71 TEU.  Stating YES or NO if there is a clear risk of a serious breach of our values. That is what we have to do.</p><p>I want to end with a personal message to you, Mr. Orban, Dear Viktor,</p><p>Let's recognize that you did a fantastic job in the past by beating together with many other dissidents Communism and dictatorship. But I am afraid you are on the wrong path. </p><p>Listen to what your comrades of the past are saying to you today:</p><p>In an open letter the former Hungarian dissidents György Dalos, János Kenedi, György Konrád wrote to you and I quote : </p><p>""</p><p>Hungary is a sad example of what may happen wherever there is a concentration of crisis tendencies, aggravated by attempts to resolve problems (..) with authoritarian means and a policy of nationalistic isolation.</p><p>""</p><p>And they end their letter by saying : </p><p>""</p><p>It could be a good idea to react sharply, when someone is wiping his shoes on liberal democracy, even if that someone is an old friend.</p><p>""</p><p>I am also an old friend of yours , Viktor. Maybe I have also the right to give you some  advice. </p><p>I want to remember the words of the great Hungarian writer Sandor Marai. </p><p>He wrote in a pamphlet in 1942, a pamphlet called ""the Kidnapping of Europe"" and I quote :</p><p>""</p><p>With excess, injustice, unfairness, wild passions, ferocity, it is possible to conquer</p><p>;</p><p>Persevere, you can only by fairness, by patience, with a good sense of proportion.</p><p>""</p><p>So Viktor, bear these wise words of Sandor Marai in mind.</p>",presid mr orban convinc contrari list breach treati fundament question serious concern main articl treati breach question concern new hungarian constitut independ hungarian judiciari new media law independ data protect supervisor posit hungarian central bank new church law lot issu cardin law recent publish let misunderstand make list simpli summari fact complaint find offici letter offici intern author presid european commiss secretari general council europ commission fundament right european union venic commiss organis secur cooper europ european central bank us administr precis us secretari state hillari clinton add list complaint amnesti intern human right watch civil societi protest street offici letter offici intern author say big problem m shock m astonish yesterday european commiss launch infring procedur relat independ central bank retir age judg independ data protect supervisor let clear stake main technic issu necessari check conform hungarian constitut cardin law european valu democraci rule law freedom religion freedom express equal also think besid infring procedur hous take respons call colleagu libe committe make report basi articl teu state yes clear risk serious breach valu want end person messag mr orban dear viktor let recogn fantast job past beat togeth mani dissid communism dictatorship afraid wrong path listen comrad past say today open letter former hungarian dissid györgi dalo jános kenedi györgi konrád wrote quot hungari sad exampl may happen wherev concentr crisi tendenc aggrav attempt resolv problem authoritarian mean polici nationalist isol end letter say could good idea react sharpli someon wipe shoe liber democraci even someon old friend also old friend viktor mayb also right give advic want rememb word great hungarian writer sandor marai wrote pamphlet pamphlet call kidnap europ quot excess injustic unfair wild passion feroc possibl conquer persever fair patienc good sens proport viktor bear wise word sandor marai mind,en

Speech by Guy Verhofstadt - New Years Reception January 2012,10-01-2012,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,626,"<p>Excellencies, </p><p>Dear colleagues,</p><p>Dear Friends,
</p><p>2012 is going to be yet another 'make or break' year for the European Union.
</p><p>I might recall, the same was said about 2011, about 2010 and maybe even – I don’t remember - about 2009.
</p><p>Last year, more and more, civil society, social networks and private groups took their fate in their own hands. Be it the Arab Spring, the Occupy Wall Street Movement in the US or the recent protests in Russia. TIME magazine recognised “the Protester” as the person of the year. 
</p><p>I believe, however, that this social, economic and political phenomenon is hiding a crucial fact: lack of leadership.
</p><p>The European Union is a perfect example of this. 
</p><p>The Merkozy, go-it-alone, too-little-too-late strategies of the last two years have delivered nothing. On the contrary, they continue to drag on the crisis. Some call it even the sunset of Europe.
</p><p>I agree.
</p><p>If we continue like this, Europe will be faced with a long ""Japanese winter"" with no growth, with industrial stagnation, with demographic decline. Much as happened in Japan after their real estate and banking crisis during the early nineties.
</p><p>A Japanese winter, that is if we choose NOT to act. </p><p>That is if we choose NOT to speak up.</p><p>That is if we choose NOT to be part of the solution.
</p><p>Liberal democrats believe that the answer to the crisis is crystal clear - a more integrated Europe.
</p><p>2012 should be the year, when European Union leaders go back to their roots.
</p><p>2012 should be the year, when we bring back to life the Monnet principles.</p><p> </p><p>2012 should be the year, when the European Union reinforces the community method and turns its back on the re-nationalisation of European policies.
</p><p>2012 will hopefully be the year, when Europe will prove its critics wrong. The year when it emerges from the crisis more united, stronger and more self confident.
</p><p>With one currency.</p><p>With one economic and fiscal policy.</p><p>With a revived internal market that extends opportunities to all our citizens and companies.
</p><p>A Union that speaks with one voice and leads the world.
</p><p>A Union that also fights against discrimination and promotes equality and democracy. In Hungary, for example. It is a shame that we have to wait for a letter of State Secretary Hilary Clinton before the European Union acts. The Hungarian crisis is as important as the euro crisis. Both concern the credibility of our Union in the eyes of our citizens. 
</p><p>So I see no other option in the case of Hungary than to launch with the Parliament the procedure foreseen in article 7 paragraph 1 of the treaty.
</p><p>This is the position of the liberal democrats, the vision of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
</p><p>And as we embark on this New Year, I would like to express my hope that our Union becomes again a Union of 27 instead of 26 thanks to the political games of euro-sceptic David Cameron. Yesterday in London with Nick Clegg he stated his firm commitment to bring Britain back into the Union as fast as possible. So that the new treaty applies to all 27 Member States and can easily be incorporated into the existing “acquis”.
</p><p>This is absolutely crucial, as it is clear now after his speech in Toulon, that French President Sarkozy wants to abuse the euro-crisis and the new treaty to bypass the community institutions and to establish an intergovernmental “directoire” under Franco-German control. 
</p><p>The ALDE, together with all the other pro-European parties in the Parliament, will do everything that is necessary to avoid this.
</p><p>Finally I want to thank you all, members and staff for your hard work – and most importantly  – for your commitment. 
</p><p>On this basis, and with your help - I am confident that 2012 is going to be a good liberal, democratic and European year.

Speech by Guy Verhofstadt to the ELDR Congress in Palermo,26-11-2011,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,1754,"<p>Dear colleagues</p><p>Many of you have been asking me “what is this plaster on your forehead”. Who did you fight with? Well I can assure you, it is not because of the eurocrisis. It is not even because of the Belgian crisis. Even if in Belgium we could use a lot of plasters at the moment. It was a stupid accident, actually. I thought it was an open door, but in fact, it was a closed window. </p><p>It’s a little bit like the eurocrisis now. Like we are handling the eurocrisis now. Also in the eurocrisis today, heads of states and government every time are hitting their heads against the wall. A very hard brick wall. And already for 24 months. Taking half measures. That are not working. Making this crisis worse and worse. But I come back to this later. </p><p>Dear Friends,</p><p>I know, that there is a lot of euroscpetisism in Europe.  Let’s be honest, even in this room. Criticism towards Europe, Eurobonds, criticism towards the European budget, criticism towards a more integrated Europe. </p><p>Moreover, lets be honest about it, some of our own political parties are tempted to follow growing nationalism, growing populism, euroscepticism.</p><p>While I believe, that liberalism is exactly the opposite, the antithesis, of nationalism, and populism. </p><p>Moreover, one should never ignore a simple, fundamental rule of politics: People, the citizens, never vote for the copy, always for the original.  Don’t try and out sceptic the sceptics. You never win elections that way.</p><p>Dear Friends, </p><p>We are not in a crisis of the single currency. We are in fact in a crisis of the European Union itself. Even a crisis of the European project. </p><p>And, Yes, that is due to Greece. And, Yes, that is due to bad finances in several of our countries. And, Yes that is due to bad leadership, from both, conservatives and socialists. </p><p>But let’s be blunt about it. </p><p>It is mainly due to, it is essentially due to the fact, that we launched a monetary union, but we did not install the economic, the fiscal and the political union needed. </p><p>Really, a single currency with 17 different governements, 17 different bond markets, 17 different economic strategies, it can simply not work! </p><p>It does not exist anywhere. </p><p>A single currency needs a single political authority. Maybe a state can exist without a currency, but a currency can’t exist without a state…,  a liberal state of course.</p><p>Dear Friends,</p><p>What is the way out of this crisis?</p><p>The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats in the European Parliament has made it clear from the beginning: We do not believe in less, but in more Europe. </p><p>Europe is not the problem. Europe is the solution to the problem. </p><p>In fact the choice that we have to make is very clear. </p><p>Either we are capable in the next weeks and next months to establish a real federal union or the Euro shall disappear. </p><p>And the loss of the Euro will be a tragedy.</p><p>A disaster. A disaster for everyone. </p><p>A disaster for the South of Europe, a disaster for the core of Europe. A disaster mainly for the biggest country of the European Union, for Germany. </p><p>It is the engine of their economic growth, the drive of their successful export. The source for their surplus on their trade balance.  In short, the reason for their success. </p><p>But not only for Germany. The Euro has protected us all against the fall-out of the financial crisis in 2008. Iceland, Hungary, even Denmark, were in big trouble. Without the euro, it would have been a mess everywhere. In all the other countries too. With devaluations and depreciations all over. </p><p>But let me tell you, that maybe the country that has the most to loose from the disappearance of the euro, is the UK, the City of London. The financial heart of Europe. That is not in Frankfurt. It is in London. </p><p>They trade more in euros than any other city in the world. </p><p>So how to rescue the Euro? How to save the European project? </p><p>Whether you like it or not, we have to establish as fast as possible a fiscal, economic and political Union. A federal Union. Yes, why fear the word? </p><p>I know, it is not in the Jacobian tradition of the French. And certainly it is not the reason for our “successes” between brackets in Belgium. </p><p>But lets face the reality: the most powerful country in the world today, is a federal state for more than 200 hundered years, the United States of America. And the most powerful state in the Union since the Second World War. It’s Germany. The Federal Republic of Germany.</p><p>Whether we call it federal or not. We can only save the euro if we establish real discipline and at the same time real solidarity. And I am talking about both of them. Discipline and solidarity. Solidarity and discipline. </p><p>Discipline without solidarity is not a real union. And solidarity without discipline is simply a bottomless pit. </p><p>Without solidarity and discipline the monetary union is not sustainable. </p><p>When I hear today that Mrs. Merkel wants to change the Treaty and to root discipline in the Treaty, in article 136, I can only applaude. Also, Andrew Duff, I think, he likes Treaty changes.  But I am also saying, if we change article 136, we need also to change article 125. To anchor solidarity in the Treaty.</p><p>Nevertheless I do not like to criticse Germany all the time. That we are now under a German “diktat”. Discipline is not a German “diktat”, it is a liberal “diktat”. As solidarity is also a liberal diktat. They are two sides of the same coin. They reinforce each other. And the fact that we defend both of them, makes us unique. Conservatives speak only of discipline and socialist throw money at so called solidarity. We keep the balance. </p><p>That’s the reason why our Group, the ALDE Group, is very outspoken on the way out of this crisis. </p><p>Let’s be honest between us. We also have our differences. On Eurobonds for instance.</p><p>But we are firmly united behind the idea that we need solutions for the short and the long term. On the short term, we firmly believe in the idea of a European collective redemption fund. A fund of 2.3 trillion euro. Proposed by the five wise economists. German economists. Where we mutualise debt of the euro countries above the 60% mark, but combined with bold debt reductions schemes. Alexander Lambsdorff defended the idea in Die Welt. And the Commission proposed it in its Green paper. </p><p>For the same reason, our Liberal Group also defends the idea of my good friend Mark Rutte. </p><p>To increase the power of the European Commission. </p><p>So that it is not the Member States that give the Green light before we can impose discipline.</p><p>Look, for nine years I was a member of the European Council and I have never seen a colleague of mine standing up, pointing his finger to another. Complaining that the other did not follow the rules. This is simply not done among peers. </p><p>And that’s another big difference between us and the other political families. We are the only force that is really defending the communitarian, supranational approach. Intergovernmentalism does not work. In any case, financial markets do not believe in it. Certainly not since 2004 France and Germany breached themselves the stability pact. </p><p>Our communitarian belief is also the reason why we defend the European budget. </p><p>Let’s stop the fight on this. It’s a budget of 1% of the GDP. </p><p>It’s certainly not the 23% of the United States. Its not time to make a big increase. </p><p>Lets be realistic, because of the bad public finances in every country. We have to stick to that figure. But we, liberals, we think that we can make a better use of this budget. Use it to make all our finances in Europe, and in the Member States more healthy.</p><p>Let me give you one example. </p><p>Do you know what is the expenditure on defence in Europe? </p><p>It is nearly half the size of the American defence budget. </p><p>And that’s a huge budget. 7 hundred billion dollars. </p><p>Nearly 5% of their GDP. </p><p>And you know what the output is of our expenditure in Europe. Only 10% of the American. With nearly half of the American budget we are only capable to do only 10% of the operations. So we are 5 times less effective than the Americans. </p><p>And it should not be a surprise. In Europe we have 27 strategic transport capabilities, 27 intelligence services, 27 maintenance units for the navy and for the air force. </p><p>By combining our efforts on the European level in military expenditures we can nearly save the whole European budget! As I already said. Europe is the solution. Not the problem.</p><p>Dear Colleagues,</p><p>Fear is a bad councillor.</p><p>My prediction is that not the nationalist and populist, but that we, the pro-European forces will win the elections in 2014. With the crisis, people shall see that more Europe is needed to safeguard their income, safeguard their wealth, safeguard their prosperity and their jobs. People know that the world is more and more dominated by countries like China and India. People shall realise that only a united Europe can guarantee their prosperity in such a world, that only a United Europe can defend their interest, their income, their jobs. </p><p>Let’s not be naïve.</p><p>The G8 in the world of 2035, shall be composed of the US, China, India, Japan, Russia, Brasil…. Mexico and Indonesia. No Brits, No Germans, No French, Sorry we are in Italy here, but also No Italians.</p><p>The only way to be and to stay there and to defend our interest, is to be united. United, as a single entity. In the G8, in the IMF, in the UN. United in our principles. And united in our beliefs. </p><p>Its true, people are afraid today. It is probably true that this fear is the most important reason for their increased attraction to populism and nationalism. </p><p>Populists and nationalists who tell the people that you can keep the world outside their borders. Well, that’s a lie.</p><p>But it is not a lie that citizens have fear. So we have to tell another story. Our story. You can not keep the world outside your borders. But only a strong and united Europe can overcome this and create the stability and the security that citizens are looking for. </p><p>That’s what we believe in. </p><p>That’s what we stand for.</p>",dear colleaguesmani ask plaster forehead fight well assur eurocrisi even belgian crisi even belgium could use lot plaster moment stupid accid actual thought open door fact close window littl

The Commission has to launch a global and bold plan to tackle the crisis. What certainly must end now, is two countries, France and Germany, meeting each other once every two weeks and fixing half measures that calm markets for only 24 hours.</p><p>Again what we need is a global approach, a global action plan and a roadmap, an ""Act to establish a real economic and fiscal Union"".</p><p>I have sent to all of you what could be the key elements of such an Act:  </p><p>The existing EFSF and the ECRF together should have a firepower of 3.3 trillion euro.</p><p>So I repeat, one way or the other we need a system of eurobonds within the 60% or beyond the 60% threshold if we want to end this crisis.</p><p>Change of leadership in Greece and Italy is important, no, it's crucial, but it's not decisive to end the crisis.</p><p>Only a real economic government combined with a form of eurobonds can stop this.</p><p>The final question is, is a change of the Treaty necessary?</p><p>You don't need to change the Treaty to discuss and to conclude on the ""Act for an economic and fiscal Union"" that we need. </p><p>And much can be done inside the existing Treaty. </p><p>But changes are necessary.

Intervention Guy Verhofstadt - Outcome of Eurozone crisis summit,27-10-2011,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,453,"<p>Let me as always be very blunt: I am relieved.</p><p>Finally, we start to put in place a global and bold approach to stabilise the euro.</p><p>Finally, we stop our hesitating approach of the last 20 months.</p><p>Because let us also be very blunt about that. This crisis has been prolonged and worsened by the way this has been handled from the beginning.</p><p>Half measures, contradictions, hesitations.</p><p>So finally, this comes to an end.</p><p>And it's not by accident that the markets react positively.</p><p>But let's be realistic, a few good days on the markets doesn't mean we have reached our goal.</p><p>Our goal is to strengthen and stabilise the euro, and on the mid, and on the long-term.</p><p>For that, I think two things are crucial now.</p><p>- </p><p>	</p><p>The first is that the new firepower of the rescue fund is real.</p><p>Real in the sense that the markets are convinced by it.</p><p>One trillion is an impressive figure. It's big.</p><p>But I have my doubts that on the long-term it can be achieved when we offer a guaranty of 20%, when on the other hand we agree on a 50 % hair cut, like in the case of Greece.</p><p>	</p><p>I hope I'm wrong.</p><p>	</p><p>- </p><p>	</p><p>My second point is even more important.  </p><p>We have to use the next weeks and months to lay the foundations of a real economic and fiscal union for the euro zone.</p><p>Because that is the root of this crisis, the lack of such an economic and fiscal union.</p><p>Concretely, this means two things:</p><p>(1) The Commission has to come forward the fastest as possible with her Green paper on Eurobonds. </p><p>Only a Eurobond market can stop the tensions and can avoid the repetition of the mess of last year.</p><p>(2) We need to establish a real economic government in the euro zone.</p><p>I have nothing against the idea to formalise two euro summits, chaired by you, Mr. Van Rompuy. That happens already.</p><p>But that is not the economic government we need.</p><p>What we need, is indicated in paragraph 28 of the summit conclusions.</p><p>And I am very pleased that Olli Rehn has been appointed Vice-President of the Commission and Commissioner in charge of the euro. He should chair an inner cabinet with all commissioners with portfolios that are linked to the euro. </p><p>And secondly, he should also chair the meeting of the Ministers of Finance of the euro zone. </p><p>Let's make the system consistent. </p><p>My request to you Mr. Barroso, is that you put a legislative proposal in that sense on the table of the European Parliament and European Council, the fastest as possible.

Young politicians, young people that were just becoming aware of what democracy and citizenship means, most of them not even young enough to vote.</p><p>Not only a terrible drama and a huge loss, but also a direct attack on democracy itself.</p><p>But simply voicing our disgust is too easy.</p><p>We cannot turn a blind eye to an act of violence like this. Breivik was maybe a madman, acting alone, but let's be very blunt about it: he is the product of a society, a movement a whole community of anti Islamic activists, chatters and bloggers, who despise and reject our multicultural societies.</p><p>What struck me the most, was how quickly public figures and politicians declined any responsibility, when instead they should have reacted fiercely against the ideology of Breivik.</p><p>An ideology that is anti- Islamic, anti- migration, against a multicultural and diverse society, against politically correct thinking, against Europe and against the European Union.
</p><p>Breivik was acting against the backdrop of a narrative which is becoming more and more common, which describes the current situation in Europe as dramatic, and considers our society to have come to a point where it is no longer possible to trust any democratic government at all.</p><p>We have to repeat and to remember the words of former president Clinton in his speech at the 15 year commemoration of the Oklahoma bombing.

They are saying what we are saying: there can't be a common currency without an economic union.</p><p>That means that we not only need sanctions for those countries that are not fulfilling their duties. We need the Commission, not the Member States to have to power to decide that. Member States don't punish themselves. </p><p>That is why Parliament decided last week to stick to a reversed voting system. For us it is essential that the Commission takes the decision and that the Council can only decide to overturn it.</p><p>Don't say: this is irresponsible of the Parliament. This is not the time to block such an important package. It is not the Parliament which is blocking. It is the Council. The Council only has to say yes and the Parliament will vote the whole package next week. It is not difficult. It is as easy as that. </p><p>My second point concerns Schengen and the risk of disintegration of the Union.</p><p>Frankly, I don't understand what the Council has decided. </p><p>There exists today within Schengen an extraordinary possibility to reintroduce border controls in two cases: if there is a serious problem of national security or a serious problem of public order.</p><p>Why do we need a third one?</p><p>Introducing a third one linked on migration is not saving Schengen, it is killing Schengen. </p><p>Ou en français pour le Président français: Schengen ne sera pas sauvé, Schengen sera tué. </p><p>Et avec Schengen, l'idée fondamentale de l'intégration européenne sera tuée.</p><p>The position of my Group, and I think of the whole Parliament is very clear: we are not going to vote for a new possibility to reintroduce border controls. Not now, not ever.</p><p>What Europe needs, is not reintroducing internal borders. </p><p>What Europe needs, is enforcing common external borders.</p><p>What Europe needs is a common Asylum policy. A common Migration policy. </p><p>As stated in the Treaty.</p><p>And as stated in the Treaty we need to share the burden in case of a mass influx of third countries.</p><p>That is what we need.</p><p>Just as we did with the 300.000 refugees from Kosovo.</p><p>At that moment we didn't need a third exception or a change of the Schengen acquis.

"Verhofstadt on Libya: ""The weak position of the EU makes me sick""",16-03-2011,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,309,"<p>The fall-out from the Japanese tsunami has inevitably dominated media reports and blurred international attention to the rout of the Libyan opposition, left to fend off Gaddafi and his mercenaries by themselves.

The world is aware that there are historic events taking place in Egypt and Tunisia.</p><p>What is happening in North Africa and the Middle East is reminiscent of the events in Europe in 1989.</p><p>That is why I am surprised, astonished, even extremely disappointed that Europe is making the same mistakes as in 1989.</p><p>It is unbelievable that we, Europeans, the democratic continent, have not managed to give our unreserved support to the Egyptian people amassed on the streets in Cairo and elsewhere demanding nothing more than freedom and democracy.</p><p>Why, Lady Ashton, has Europe reacted so feebly, almost invisibly ? Following your initial statements last week, German, France and the UK issued their own - but without consultation, as if Europe did not exist. The only really good European intervention came from outside the EU - from the Turkish Prime Minister who stated that President Mubarak should listen to the demands of his people and go.</p><p>In my view, there are two reasons for our current timidity:</p><p>1) We have not grasped the historic nature of what is happening,</p><p>2) We have wrongly analysed the situation. We are afraid of an islamist regime filling the vacuum after elections. Such an approach is not only paternalistic it is an erroneous assessment based on a misreading of the facts.</p><p>Personally, I have confidence in the Tunisian and Egyptian people. They want an open democracy for everyone, whatever their convictions - left, right, nationalist, islamic, christian or secular. In the streets of Cairo, Copts and Muslims are marching shoulder to shoulder. That's the reality.</p><p>Another example is that of Mohamed Bouazizi, the young man who initiated the Tunisian revolution by his immolation. On Bouazizi's coffin there was no green flag of Islam, there was just the Tunisian flag. These are not islamic revolutions they are revolutions for freedom.</p><p>For almost a week, hundreds of thousands of people have been amassing in Cairo whilst similar demonstrations take place in Jordan, Yemen, Syria and Algeria. We want you, Lady Ashton, to outline clearly the EU's position, clearly stating the EU's full support for the Egyptian people and their demands. We want Mubarak to hear the message loud and clear and open his country to freedom and democracy.</p><p>Lady Ashton, do not be afraid.</p>",afraid world awar histor event take place egypt tunisia happen north africa middl east reminisc event europ surpris astonish even extrem disappoint europ make mistak unbeliev european democrat contin manag give unreserv support egyptian peopl amass street cairo elsewher demand noth freedom democraci ladi ashton europ react feebli almost invis follow initi statement last week german franc uk issu without consult europ exist realli good european intervent came outsid eu turkish prime minist state presid mubarak listen demand peopl go view two reason current timid grasp histor natur happen wrong analys situat afraid islamist regim fill vacuum elect approach paternalist erron assess base misread fact person confid tunisian egyptian peopl want open democraci everyon whatev convict left right nationalist islam christian secular street cairo copt muslim march shoulder shoulder realiti anoth exampl moham bouazizi young man initi tunisian revolut immol bouazizi coffin green flag islam tunisian flag islam revolut revolut freedom almost week hundr thousand peopl amass cairo whilst similar demonstr take place jordan yemen syria algeria want ladi ashton outlin clear eu posit clear state eu full support egyptian peopl demand want mubarak hear messag loud clear open countri freedom democraci ladi ashton afraid,en
We have to fight racism and populism in Europe,22-10-2010,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,494,"<p>In more and more European countries we see the rise of extreme right and populist parties. In several countries they are elected to parliament, in some they are even in government or supporting the government. This evolution worries the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats a lot because what the extremist and populist parties are standing for is exactly the opposite of what we believe in and what we are fighting for day after day in the European Union. </p><p>Across Europe, Liberal parties follow different strategies in order to oppose extremist and populist parties. We trust that liberal parties will stand strong and firm on our shared liberal values. On these matters, the ALDE Group will be vigilant. We will judge the governments on their policies. We will not accept they will ever end in racist, intolerant policies targeted against minorities based on colour, religion, origin or sexual orientation. We will not hesitate to act if necessary, as we did over the Roma issue, to condemn acts of intolerance and prejudice. We will never accept policies that conflict with fundamental liberal and democratic values.</p><p>Perhaps more worrying is the tendency that more and more politicians from moderate parties from all over Europe are starting to repeat the same populist discourse. (Over the last few weeks and months) we have seen policies against minorities (including the Roma), a general radicalisation about religion and attacks against the open and multicultural society. We also see a return of the discourse of national identity.</p><p>For all moderate politicians there is a choice to make. Either we follow this populist discourse in the hope of countering it - a contradictory approach in so far as one cannot oppose extreme right and populist ideas by imitating them - or we analyse more carefully the reasons for the rise of these parties. </p><p>It is a fact that European citizens fear their welfare is declining. They fear the consequences of climate change. They fear that globalisation means that other continents are taking over and Europe will be left behind. The successful formula of extreme right and populist parties is that they feed and exploit these fears and propose a closed society instead.</p><p>We, Liberals and Democrats, are convinced this ideology of retreating into a nationalist air-raid shelter is the wrong answer to the current challenges. Even more, this answer will turn the challenges into more serious problems for our future. What we need to do instead is to adapt our society to the new multi-polar world: </p><p>- provide the answers to the current economic crisis, and make the process of globalisation something with positive benefit to people's lives; </p><p>- create a humane sustainable and balanced European migration policy;</p><p>- vigorously defend the open society.</p><p>This conclusion after a broad debate in the Bureau of the ALDE - Group shall be the basis of a conference in which we will elaborate with in-depth analyses the rise of extreme right and populism in Europe and the strategies to counter them.</p>",european countri see rise extrem right populist parti sever countri elect parliament even govern support govern evolut worri allianc liber democrat lot extremist populist parti stand exact opposit believ fight day day european union across europ liber parti follow differ strategi order oppos extremist populist parti trust liber parti stand strong firm share liber valu matter ald group vigil judg govern polici accept ever end racist intoler polici target minor base colour religion origin sexual orient hesit act necessari roma issu condemn act intoler prejudic never accept polici conflict fundament liber democrat valu perhap worri tendenc politician moder parti europ start repeat populist discours last week month seen polici minor includ roma general radicalis religion attack open multicultur societi also see return discours nation ident moder politician choic make either follow populist discours hope counter contradictori approach far one cannot oppos extrem right populist idea imit analys care reason rise parti fact european citizen fear welfar declin fear consequ climat chang fear globalis mean contin take europ left behind success formula extrem right populist parti feed exploit fear propos close societi instead liber democrat convinc ideolog retreat nationalist airraid shelter wrong answer current challeng even answer turn challeng serious problem futur need instead adapt societi new multipolar world provid answer current econom crisi make process globalis someth posit benefit peopl live creat human sustain balanc european migrat polici vigor defend open societi conclus broad debat bureau ald group shall basi confer elabor indepth analys rise extrem right popul europ strategi counter,en
Speech by Guy Verhofstadt - 60 years since the Schuman Declaration,07-05-2010,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,647,"<p>Speech by Guy Verhofstadt</p><p>
</p><p>60 years since the Schuman Declaration</p><p>
</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen</p><p>,
</p><p>Sixty years ago our continent had to answer a crucial question: are we going to work, live and die like we did for so many decades? Or are we finally going to work together? Robert Schumann was the one answering that question. Knowing that only by European cooperation, only promoting a community method for coal and steel, only with more Europe we would reach peace and prosperity. And by answering that question he made the 9th of May a turning point in world history.
</p><p>Today, exactly sixty years later, we stand again on a turning point in history. Today again we must answer a crucial question about the direction of the Union in the future: do we want a Europe of the member-states, an intergovernmental Europe? Or do we want a political Europe, a Union based on the community method? In other words, are we going to an ever looser Union or an ever closer Union? That is the question that we need to answer today.
</p><p>Some people would argue that with the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty the community method has been carved in stone. Theoretically they are right. But what we see in every day politics is exactly the opposite. In every single important dossier it is the intergovernmental approach that has been taken. Every single time.
</p><p>Take for example the EU 2020 strategy. Today everyone agrees that the Lisbon strategy was a failure. Not because of the current crisis, but because of the method of open coordination, peer review and best practices. The only method that would really work is giving the European Commission more power to enforce member-states to reach their goals. The Community method. But what do we see. The Council gave not more but less power to the Commission. And even worse, they have set up themselves a taskforce on economic governance, degrading the European Commission to a kind of executive secretariat of the Council. Making EU 2020 an intergovernmental strategy.
</p><p>An even more striking example is of course the way the problem of Greece has been handled. I almost said solved, but it is not solved yet. Instead of giving the Commission and the ECB the task to work out as soon as possible a European loan to Greece, our capitals have discussed for months what they would do and after that another month on how they would do it. At the same time increasing the anti-European sentiment all over the continent. And even letting Greece and the euro collapse in the process. It proves that the intergovernmental method is too slow and inefficient to deal with the problems of today. 
</p><p>But apparently, this experience was not enough. We haven’t learnt our lesson. Because the proposal for the European External Action Service is again based on the intergovernmental method. As far as possible from the Commission. And of course from the Parliament.
</p><p>That is why I am saying that we are at a turning point in European history. Just as we were in 1950. Are we choosing an intergovernmental Europe? Or are we choosing a Union based on the method of Schumann and Monnet? What Schumann did on the 9th of May 1950 wasn’t just visionary. It was in the first place courageous. To give away important national power in order to build a European power. 
</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,
</p><p>Today, sixty years later, we need to follow his example and be courageous. We must fight for the Community method. Even if we have to fight alone. This Parliament not only received new powers. It also received a new responsibility. And I must say I am glad. Because I feel in all different political groups enough people ready to take their responsibility. And to push Europe in the direction of Robert Schuman, the direction towards an ever closer union.
</p><p>Thank you.</p>",speech year sinc schuman declar ladi gentlemen sixti year ago contin answer crucial question go work live die like mani decad final go work togeth robert schumann one answer question know european cooper promot communiti method coal steel europ would reach peac prosper answer question made th may turn point world histori today exact sixti year later stand turn point histori today must answer crucial question direct union futur want europ memberst intergovernment europ want polit europ union base communiti method word go ever looser union ever closer union question need answer today peopl would argu ratif lisbon treati communiti method carv stone theoret right see everi day polit exact opposit everi singl import dossier intergovernment approach taken everi singl time take exampl eu strategi today everyon agre lisbon strategi failur current crisi method open coordin peer review best practic method would realli work give european commiss power enforc memberst reach goal communiti method see council gave less power commiss even wors set taskforc econom govern degrad european commiss kind execut secretariat council make eu intergovernment strategi even strike exampl cours way problem greec handl almost said solv solv yet instead give commiss ecb task work soon possibl european loan greec capit discuss month would anoth month would time increas antieuropean sentiment contin even let greec euro collaps process prove intergovernment method slow ineffici deal problem today appar experi enough haven learnt lesson propos european extern action servic base intergovernment method far possibl commiss cours parliament say turn point european histori choos intergovernment europ choos union base method schumann monnet schumann th may wasn visionari first place courag give away import nation power order build european power ladi gentlemen today sixti year later need follow exampl courag must fight communiti method even fight alon parliament receiv new power also receiv new respons must say glad feel differ polit group enough peopl readi take respons push europ direct robert schuman direct toward ever closer union thank,en
Verhofstadt speech in plenary on Greek economy,25-02-2010,European Parliament,Guy Verhofstadt,702,"<p>Guy Verhofstadt, on behalf of the ALDE Group</p><p>. – Mr President, first of all let me come directly to what I would call the most urgent problem today. We can talk about 2020, but we have a more urgent problem today: the eurozone and Greece. We have to find solutions to that.
</p><p>I think we, the European Parliament, have to take the initiative in this field. It is important to determine what exactly happened in Greece. Today we received contradictory information. Greece says that it has given all the information to the European Union and European institutions. At the same time, the European Commission and Eurostat are saying that they did not receive all the necessary information. At the same time the investment banks – Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank – are minimising what they have done in the Greece case.
</p><p>I therefore think it is the task of this Parliament to organise hearings with the relevant committee as quickly as possible, so that we can hear all the parties concerned on this matter and find out exactly what is happening in the case of Greece. We cannot talk about remedies, about solutions, about reforms in the European Union if first of all we do not know what really happened in the case of Greece in 2008 and 2009 and before that, and I think it is absolutely necessary that the different parties are heard by this Parliament.
</p><p>The second point is that we also have to tackle the problem of the Greek debt. I think there is only one good solution to that. Yesterday I read the article by George Soros in the Financial Times on the matter, and a few days ago I read the article by Joschka Fischer in the German press. He is saying what many people are saying: the best solution to the Greek debt is a European solution – euro obligations, or a European monetary fund, without any costs to the European taxpayer, but with a solution for the future. I think it is also the task of this Parliament to ask the Commission and the Council to reflect on that possibility and to go beyond the national interests of the current Member States of the European Union to examine this possibility.
</p><p>Thirdly, I think the most important part of this debate is, naturally, what to do about 2020. I think Greece is a very good example of what went wrong with the Lisbon Strategy. The Lisbon Strategy was too weak; the gap between the German economy and the Greek economy widened over the last 10 years: it became bigger, not smaller, after the Lisbon Strategy. What we need – and it is the first decision to be taken by the Commission and the European Council – is to recognise that the open coordination method was not a good method; it was too weak a method. We need a bolder instrument inside the European Union. This bolder instrument is economic governance inside the European Union.
</p><p>Mr Barroso, I hope that in a few days’ time, at the beginning of March – I think it is 3 March – you come forward with a paper on this. I hope it will include a bolder strategy than the things that were concluded or not concluded at the informal summit. It is still an intergovernmental, open‑coordination method. They make it a little bit better, a little bit faster, but at the end it continues to be an open coordination method based on intergovernmentalism. What we ask from you is to take the lead on that, on this economic policy and on this economic governance, and to come forward, together with Olli Rehn, with a bold proposal to have economic governance inside the European Union. It is nonsense to have monetary union on the one hand and not to have an economic and social and political union on the other. The problems with Greece are proof of that.
</p><p>(Applause)
</p><p>I think this is a time when we can expect something bold from the Commission, and I hope that on 3 March the Commission will propose a document that is far more ambitious than the – in my view – disappointing conclusions of the informal summit.
