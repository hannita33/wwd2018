Jean-Claude Trichet: Short Address at the Gala Dinner for the 50th anniversary of the Bundesbank,20-09-2007,European Central Bank,ECB,973,"Dear Chancellor, Dear Prime Minister,Dear Mrs. Mayor, Dear President of the Bundesbank, Dear colleagues from the Bundesbank, dear colleagues of the Euro system,Dear guests, ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to celebrate with you this evening the 50th anniversary of the Deutsche Bundesbank. The year 1957 was marked by a number of events that should subsequently prove to be major milestones in the areas of technological, institutional and economic development: the launch of the first artificial satellite, the signature of the Treaty of Rome, and the foundation of the Deutsche Bundesbank. At the time, I was a teenager and I have to confess that I very closely followed only the first event. Since then I had the privilege to appreciate the immense historical importance of the Treaty of Rome for peace and prosperity on our continent. With regard to the Bundesbank, I think that it is fair to say that its foundation provided not only Europe but also the rest of the world with a very good example, and indeed a role model, of central banking. The trademarks of this role model are monetary stability, independence and credibility. The Bundesbank has embodied them from its inception, and, today, they are recognised all over the world as essential for monetary policy to deliver price stability and, in this way, to support sustained economic growth and job creation.I myself had the honor of being ten years the Governor of the Bank of France independent by the will of the French people, since 1isJanuary 1994 before moving witness to the Governor Noyer. And I can not hide the pride that was ours when we were able to show our citizens that the primary mandate of price stability - the Bank of France had established in January 1994 as being less than 2% - associated with full independence, we allowed after four years to eliminate any risk premium between the French franc and the German mark. It was also remarkable results with other national central banks, a decisive contribution to the creation of the single currency.Independence from executive branches is an essential feature of the institutional framework for a successful monetary policy as it allows the central bank to pursue its primary objective and to take full responsibility for its actions. The legal and institutional framework of the Bundesbank has been decisive in this respect, but equally important has been the quality of its staff and leadership. I have had the very great privilege to know and work closely with five of the Bundesbank’s Presidents - Karl-Otto Pöhl, Helmut Schlesinger, Hans Tietmeyer, Ernst Welteke and Axel Weber - and with Board members, in particular Otmar Issing and Jürgen Stark at both the Bundesbank and the ECB, as well as with the many excellent professionals committed to fulfilling the mission of this important institution. The clear objective of price stability and the independence from executive branches, however, only necessary conditions for the success of the Bundesbank as an institution. The additional and decisive condition has been the credibility it gained with the German people and with global financial markets. Credibility is not something that can be installed by decree, it has to be earned. The strong determination of the German people to keep the value of their money stable on a lasting basis had initially provided the Bundesbank with a broad constituency that shared this conviction about importance of price stability and its task “to safeguard the currency”, or ""The currency to secure"" as it says in the Bundesbank Act. As the vivid memory of the hyperinflation faded and price stability was achieved, the Bundesbank’s credibility - fostered by a broad-based and intensive communication with all parts of society - was essential to protect its independence and rebuff any temptations to relax the notion of price stability. I would remind you that price stability and central bank independence must be actually defended day by day, as they have always wanted to the test: 1956, even before the formal establishment of the Bundesbank, urged Chancellor Adenauer, one should increase the key interest rates by as much as shift of 100 basis points. However, the German central bank did not engage it, and convinced the German population of its policies, and the fact that they would ensure that the money value remains. In the next 50 years there have been many more challenges: the end of the Bretton Woods system, larger oil crises, the reunification, the fundamentals of the European Monetary System and the preparations for economic and monetary union - to name just a few. All such challenges met the Bundesbank with sovereignty and firm principles.As president of the first independent Banque de France I am proud that I in the preparation of economic and monetary union, together with representatives of the Bundesbank - could participate - on the basis of the priority order of price stability and the clear independence of the ECB from political influence. The wording of the contract and cooperation with the main players on the German side I have found to be particularly rewarding. These personalities have contributed significantly to the design and functioning of the Maastricht Treaty. Here I would definitely Horst Köhler, the current President, mention, with whom I have been negotiating the Maastricht Treaty and my colleagues.Today I have been privileged to work with the Bundesbank as a member of the Eurosystem, the full success of the European monetary team and to fulfill our mandate to maintain price stability, contributes. Fifty years may be perceived by some as advanced age, but for a successful institution like the Bundesbank, this anniversary is no cause for sadness, but also represents an award. The values ​​and contributions which brings the Bundesbank in the euro system, young as ever and ever.Congratulations! I would like to express my gratitude and friendship you, Axel, and your institution!Reproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.

Jean-Claude Trichet: Governance and convergence: the state of play in the euro area,28-02-2007,European Central Bank,ECB,2888,"Ladies and Gentlemen, gentlemen, let me first thank Mrs. Pervenche Berès for inviting me to discuss a very important subject, which is the convergence of the economies of the eurozone. It is indeed a great pleasure for me to share with you and my colleagues and friends Jean Claude Juncker and Joaquin Almunia today some thoughts on this subject.Dear Sirs, ladies and gentlemen, before I begin, I would first like Mrs Berès thank for the invitation and the realization of this very important open debate on the state of convergence within the euro area. It is a particular pleasure to be able to share some thoughts on this subject with you and my colleagues Jean Claude Juncker and Joaquin Almunia.Economic and Monetary Union and the creation of the euro area - a single economy with a single currency at the level of a continent - was, and still is, a formidable endeavour. Contradicting all those sceptical – academics, media and other observers –, who had anticipated a failure, EMU has been a great success. For eight years we have successfully worked together in the euro area with a single monetary policy and a single currency. To those who claim that the euro has played against job creation, I would like to mention here two striking numbers : over the 8 years since the creation of the euro, the euro area created more than 12 million jobs ; over the 8 years preceding the creation of the euro, less than 3 million jobs were created ; of course I do not want to give the full credit of these job creations to the advent of the euro, but it is difficult to deny that EMU contributed to this achievement. With Slovenia joining the euro area, the latter is now embracing 13 countries and a population of around 317 million, a little bit larger than the population of the US. This story of success, however, requires a continuous effort from all of us, from the ECB, from the Commission, from the national authorities, from the Eurogroup and from you, members of European Parliament and of national parliaments, to continuously provide ‘good’ governance to the euro zone.Before sharing with you some thoughts for the good governance of such a vast area, let me first provide you with our assessment and view on the current state of diversity in the euro area.Although I will focus on growth differentials and its related policy implications, let me briefly mention to you that in the case of inflation differentials, as you know, the current degree of dispersion across the euro area countries is historically low. Since 1999, inflation differentials across the euro area countries, measured by the unweighted measure of standard deviation, has been fluctuating around 1 percentage point, when at the beginning of the 1990s it was standing at around 6 percentage points. And last year, inflation dispersion reached a level of 0.7 percentage points. Moreover, the current degree of inflation dispersion among the euro area countries is practically the same as that seen in the US, in particular with the available data from 14 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas.In the case of output growth, the current degree of differences in output growth across the euro area countries is neither large by historical standards nor by references to other relevant geographical areas. In fact, since 1999 – the start of the third stage of EMU – growth differentials have declined somewhat. First, the dispersion of real GDP growth rates across the euro area countries, measured by the standard deviation in unweighted terms, has been fluctuating around a level of 2 percentage points, and has shown no apparent upward or downward trend over the past 35 years. However, since 1999, the degree of dispersion in annual average terms, also measured by the unweighted standard deviation, has declined among the euro area countries and in the last year is estimated to have declined further to slightly below 1.5 percentage points. Because sometimes the discussion focuses on the largest economies, let me mention that when looking at the four largest euro area economies, their growth differentials have been much lower, with a standard deviation fluctuating around a level of 1 percentage point. Moreover, compared with other currency areas, the current degree of output growth dispersion within the euro area, measured by the standard deviation in unweighted terms, does not appear to be significantly different than that observed across regions or states within the United States. Across the 8 US regions, as defined by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, the unweighted standard deviation has been fluctuating around 1.5 percentage points over the last years. The second stylised fact that I would like to stress, which is relevant for the conduct of the single monetary policy of the ECB, is that the degree of synchronisation of business cycles across the euro area countries seems to have increased since the beginning of the 1990s. This finding holds for various measures of synchronisation applied to overall economic activity, for annual and quarterly data, as well as for various country groupings. Also last year, the strengthening of activity and the rebound in the euro area’s real GDP growth was a very widely shared phenomenon across the various countries within the euro area.And the third relevant stylised fact, related to the previous one, is that since the beginning of the 1990s the contribution to dispersion from the cyclical component of real GDP seems to have been relatively limited while most of the dispersion can be explained by differences in the trend component. In other words, differences of real GDP growth across the euro area countries since the beginning of the 1990s are largely due to trend growth differences.These findings point to the relevance of structural factors behind output growth differentials across the euro area countries over the last years, on which monetary policy, as you know, has no direct influence.Let me therefore now say a few words about the policy implications of these growth differentials, in other words what good governance means to us, in view of the vast size of the euro area.But first of all, it is important to keep in mind that, in general, output growth differentials among countries or regions are a normal feature of monetary unions. They reflect various factors. For instance, differences in economic growth within the euro area partly reflect catching up of lower income economies. Specifically, this has been visible in the successful case of Ireland, a country whose level of per capita GDP rose from well below the euro area average, at the beginning of the 1990s, to significantly above the euro area average in recent years. A relatively strong increase in per capita GDP has also been seen in other economies, such as Greece and Spain over recent years.Also, demographic factors can play a role in explaining differences in growth rates across countries. Demographic changes affect output growth, first, via the population growth rate and, second, via developments in the working age population, which is affected by changes in the age structure of the population. In particular, since the mid-1990s, output growth in Ireland, Spain and Luxembourg has been positively affected by demographic factors, partly reflecting immigration flows, while demographic factors have only made a marginal contribution to growth in Germany and Italy.Furthermore, there can be temporary differences in output growth across countries reflecting, for instance, an equilibrating adjustment process in a monetary union following a shock. There is no need to be concerned about those differences, as such differences are economically justified, are needed and are observed within other currency areas. However, in some cases we need to be concerned. These cases are those when we see persistent differences in output growth which reflect inappropriate national economic policies, structural inefficiencies and rigidities or a malfunctioning adjustment mechanism in individual countries. These are the cases we should focus on as policy makers.We all know that the very existence of a single monetary policy and thereby a uniform policy interest rate across the euro area countries does not allow using monetary policy to influence output growth differentials across euro area countries. This makes it so important that only countries which have reached sustainable convergence participate in the euro area. The decisive contribution the ECB’s single monetary policy makes to the smooth functioning of EMU is to maintain price stability – and be credible in the delivery of price stability in the future - in the euro area as a whole. Price stability is actually strongly requested by the European citizens according to various surveys and opinion polls and they attach utmost importance to the independence of the ECB in delivering such objective Addressing ‘unsatisfactory’ output growth performances in individual countries must be tackled by properly designed national policies in the fiscal and structural domains. Policies have to focus notably on increasing the adjustment capacity of economies to shocks and, in the slower growth countries, on fostering productivity and labour utilisation while maintaining stable macroeconomic conditions.In this respect, fiscal policy, under the responsibility of national authorities, can best help in EMU by being sustainable and medium-term oriented, in line with the orientations provided by the Stability and Growth Pact. The Stability and Growth Pact is the key element of fiscal governance in the euro area. It provides a clear and transparent framework for putting into operation the reference values set by the Maastricht Treaty, 3% of GDP for fiscal deficits and 60% of GDP for public debt. Ensuring sound fiscal positions is necessary in order to compensate for the absence of a significant federal budget at the level of Europe that could absorb asymmetric shocks and in order to prevent the negative impact of unbalanced national fiscal policies. In a monetary union, such incentives could even be reinforced as part of the burden induced by fiscal imbalances in one country is indeed borne by all other members. The full and consistent implementation of the Pact sets the right incentives for countries to achieve sound fiscal positions. And countries with fiscal imbalances should use the current favourable economic environment to achieve such sound position rapidly. In particular, the Pact calls on Member States to bring budget balances to their so called medium-term budgetary objectives and maintain them at that level. These objectives are designed to ensure the sustainability of the debt burden while providing sufficient leeway for budgetary fluctuations over the business cycle without jeopardising fiscal soundness. This free operation of so-called automatic stabilisers contributes to smooth economic fluctuations by letting the budget react to changes in the business cycle. In this way fiscal policies contribute to economic stability and support strong and sustainable economic growth. Fiscal policy can and should also help mitigate undesirable trend growth differentials through “high quality” expenditure and tax policies. In particular, high and inefficient public expenditure can put a brake on economic activity by imposing a high tax burden on the economy and channelling resources into unproductive uses. Public spending and tax systems need to become more efficient and growth-friendly to strengthen trend growth. Such reforms will also facilitate the adjustment of the economies in case of adverse shocks.By contrast, the pursuit of “activist” fiscal policies to fine-tune the economic cycle entails significant risks: an ill-timed fiscal policy stance can be an important source of variability in the economy. It is thus desirable that governments, as a rule, abstain from discretionary fiscal policy aimed at fine-tuning the economic cycle. Especially in the current economic environment, it is important that governments prevent discretionary policy measures from contributing pro-cyclically to the business cycle.It is in the area of structural reforms where national policies can make the most significant contribution to facilitating the working of adjustment mechanisms in individual countries and to improving long-term growth and employment prospects as well as to addressing undesirable growth underperformance in some countries. In this regard, the Lisbon process has raised the awareness among European countries that structural reforms are decisive for remaining competitive in an increasingly global economic environment. The Integrated Guidelines outlining reform and policy priorities as well as the setting-up of National Reform Programmes are suitable instruments to lead the way to a well-functioning internal market as well as to better functioning national markets. In this respect, we appreciate the inclusion of a special euro area fiche into the Integrated Guidelines, highlighting the particular reform necessities of countries that participate in the euro area. Let me briefly elaborate in more detail on these important issues.First, the focus must be on structural reforms enhancing economic flexibility. This should help to better absorb shocks and thereby improve the working of adjustment mechanisms in individual countries. In the context of EMU with a single monetary policy, the later the necessary national policy measures are taken to make the economies more flexible, the larger the potential costs can be in case of adverse shocks.How to enhance economic flexibility? There are many factors that may help to increase flexibility within the euro area. First, the Single Market needs to be completed in order to stimulate price flexibility by fostering competition and open product markets, e.g. in the services and network industries. This requires that existing barriers to labour and capital mobility within the euro area are removed. In this respect, measures aimed at protecting domestic industries or employees against competition are only counterproductive as they delay the necessary adjustment. Now that Slovenia has entered it the euro area, it is decisive that its labour force is granted full access to the labour markets of all euro area countries. As I have already stressed in several occasions, it is abnormal that there are labour restrictions as regards Slovenian workers in a number of economies that are members of the euro area.Economic flexibility can also be promoted by removing the institutional barriers to flexible price and wage setting mechanisms, in particular by easing product market regulations and employment protection legislation.Specifically, as regards wage setting, nominal and real wages should adjust to help absorb shocks. Wage setting must reflect firms’ different situations rather than being defined homogenously across sectors or countries independently of the local conditions to the risk of a higher level of unemployment. It is consequently of particular importance for all countries to achieve a high degree of wage flexibility in order to improve the ability of their labour markets to adjust to such shocks. Secondly, national policies should aim at improving long-term growth prospects by, on the one hand, affecting positively labour utilisation and, on the other, improving labour productivity growth.Structural policies can increase labour utilisation by addressing labour supply incentives that are inherent in tax and benefit systems. High average and marginal tax rates and high unemployment benefits impact negatively on the incentives to engage in paid employment or on the choice of the number of hours to work. Early retirement policies also have a significant negative effect on labour supply and, hence, on the participation and employment rates.Growth in labour productivity should be supported by policies that aim at promoting innovation and technological change. For that purpose, policies should focus on allowing the efficient functioning of entrepreneurial activities, removing for instance entry restrictions and improving labour market adaptability.Speaking in front of elected representatives, I know that the successful implementation of structural reforms requires constant explanations and well targeted communication in order to convince the citizens about their beneficial effects on growth and job creations; I fully understand the difficulty of this task and can only encourage all responsible parties in these communication efforts. I am fully aware that this is indeed a very demanding list of tasks. But this is in our view the only way ahead. There is indeed enormous work to be done by all of us. And I would like to stress ‘by all of us’. We have, the Eurosystem, the European Commission, the national governments, and the European and national Parliaments, a shared responsibility in ensuring a smooth functioning of EMU, by improving the integration and flexibility of its markets. Some differences in economic performances across countries or regions have existed and will continue to exist in the future, as it is the case in the US and in other any areas. 317 million Europeans now have decided to share a common destiny. The single currency is not only a great success and the powerful symbol of the unity of Europe in a world undergoing rapid transformation. The single currency brings us more deeply, more intimately than the European public debate is sometimes suggested. 13 countries and 25 countries today tomorrow or the next day decided to unite their destiny. These 25 democracies have democratically approved the arrangements between them. These provisions are not listed on a scrap of paper. They are listed in an international treaty that commits all those who have ratified after a copy process. My Executive Board colleagues, the Board of Governors and myself, we fully measure the trust and honor that we have been made to define and implement the monetary policy of the euro, independently, to ensure stability prices according to the Treaty. This double sense of trust and responsibility that drives us.Reproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.

Pervenche Berès de m’avoir invité à débattre sur un sujet particulièrement important, qui est le degré de convergence des économies de la zone Euro. C’est en effet un grand plaisir pour moi de partager avec vous et avec mes collègues et amis Jean Claude Juncker et Joaquin Almunia aujourd’hui quelques réflexions sur ce sujet.</p><p>Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren, sehr geehrte Abgeordnete, bevor ich beginne, möchte ich zuerst Frau Pervenche Berès danken für die Einladung und das Zustandekommen dieser sehr wichtigen offenen Debatte zum Stand der Konvergenz innerhalb des Eurogebiets. Es ist mir eine besondere Freude, mit Ihnen und meinen Kollegen Jean Claude Juncker und Joaquin Almunia einige Gedanken zu diesem Thema austauschen zu können.</p><p>Economic and Monetary Union and the creation of the euro area - a single economy with a single currency at the level of a continent - was, and still is, a formidable endeavour. Contradicting all those sceptical – academics, media and other observers –, who had anticipated a failure, EMU has been a great success. For eight years we have successfully worked together in the euro area with a single monetary policy and a single currency. To those who claim that the euro has played against job creation, I would like to mention here two striking numbers : over the 8 years since the creation of the euro, the euro area created more than 12 million jobs ; over the 8 years preceding the creation of the euro, less than 3 million jobs were created ; of course I do not want to give the full credit of these job creations to the advent of the euro, but it is difficult to deny that EMU contributed to this achievement. With Slovenia joining the euro area, the latter is now embracing 13 countries and a population of around 317 million, a little bit larger than the population of the US. This story of success, however, requires a continuous effort from all of us, from the ECB, from the Commission, from the national authorities, from the Eurogroup and from you, members of European Parliament and of national parliaments, to continuously provide ‘good’ governance to the euro zone.</p><p>Before sharing with you some thoughts for the good governance of such a vast area, let me first provide you with our assessment and view on the current state of diversity in the euro area.</p><p>Although I will focus on growth differentials and its related policy implications, let me briefly mention to you that in the case of inflation differentials, as you know, the current degree of dispersion across the euro area countries is historically low. Since 1999, inflation differentials across the euro area countries, measured by the unweighted measure of standard deviation, has been fluctuating around 1 percentage point, when at the beginning of the 1990s it was standing at around 6 percentage points. And last year, inflation dispersion reached a level of 0.7 percentage points. Moreover, the current degree of inflation dispersion among the euro area countries is practically the same as that seen in the US, in particular with the available data from 14 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas.</p><p>In the case of output growth, the current degree of differences in output growth across the euro area countries is neither large by historical standards nor by references to other relevant geographical areas. In fact, since 1999 – the start of the third stage of EMU – growth differentials have declined somewhat. </p><p>First, the dispersion of real GDP growth rates across the euro area countries, measured by the standard deviation in unweighted terms, has been fluctuating around a level of 2 percentage points, and has shown no apparent upward or downward trend over the past 35 years. However, since 1999, the degree of dispersion in annual average terms, also measured by the unweighted standard deviation, has declined among the euro area countries and in the last year is estimated to have declined further to slightly below 1.5 percentage points. Because sometimes the discussion focuses on the largest economies, let me mention that when looking at the four largest euro area economies, their growth differentials have been much lower, with a standard deviation fluctuating around a level of 1 percentage point. </p><p>Moreover, compared with other currency areas, the current degree of output growth dispersion within the euro area, measured by the standard deviation in unweighted terms, does not appear to be significantly different than that observed across regions or states within the United States. Across the 8 US regions, as defined by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, the unweighted standard deviation has been fluctuating around 1.5 percentage points over the last years. </p><p>The second stylised fact that I would like to stress, which is relevant for the conduct of the single monetary policy of the ECB, is that the degree of synchronisation of business cycles across the euro area countries seems to have increased since the beginning of the 1990s. This finding holds for various measures of synchronisation applied to overall economic activity, for annual and quarterly data, as well as for various country groupings. Also last year, the strengthening of activity and the rebound in the euro area’s real GDP growth was a very widely shared phenomenon across the various countries within the euro area.</p><p>And the third relevant stylised fact, related to the previous one, is that since the beginning of the 1990s the contribution to dispersion from the cyclical component of real GDP seems to have been relatively limited while most of the dispersion can be explained by differences in the trend component. In other words, differences of real GDP growth across the euro area countries since the beginning of the 1990s are largely due to trend growth differences.</p><p>These findings point to the relevance of structural factors behind output growth differentials across the euro area countries over the last years, on which monetary policy, as you know, has no direct influence.</p><p>Let me therefore now say a few words about the policy implications of these growth differentials, in other words what good governance means to us, in view of the vast size of the euro area.</p><p>But first of all, it is important to keep in mind that, in general, output growth differentials among countries or regions are a normal feature of monetary unions. They reflect various factors. For instance, differences in economic growth within the euro area partly reflect catching up of lower income economies. Specifically, this has been visible in the successful case of Ireland, a country whose level of per capita GDP rose from well below the euro area average, at the beginning of the 1990s, to significantly above the euro area average in recent years. A relatively strong increase in per capita GDP has also been seen in other economies, such as Greece and Spain over recent years.</p><p>Also, demographic factors can play a role in explaining differences in growth rates across countries. Demographic changes affect output growth, first, via the population growth rate and, second, via developments in the working age population, which is affected by changes in the age structure of the population. In particular, since the mid-1990s, output growth in Ireland, Spain and Luxembourg has been positively affected by demographic factors, partly reflecting immigration flows, while demographic factors have only made a marginal contribution to growth in Germany and Italy.</p><p>Furthermore, there can be temporary differences in output growth across countries reflecting, for instance, an equilibrating adjustment process in a monetary union following a shock. There is no need to be concerned about those differences, as such differences are economically justified, are needed and are observed within other currency areas. However, in some cases we need to be concerned. These cases are those when we see persistent differences in output growth which reflect inappropriate national economic policies, structural inefficiencies and rigidities or a malfunctioning adjustment mechanism in individual countries. These are the cases we should focus on as policy makers.</p><p>We all know that the very existence of a single monetary policy and thereby a uniform policy interest rate across the euro area countries does not allow using monetary policy to influence output growth differentials across euro area countries. This makes it so important that only countries which have reached sustainable convergence participate in the euro area. The decisive contribution the ECB’s single monetary policy makes to the smooth functioning of EMU is to maintain price stability – and be credible in the delivery of price stability in the future - in the euro area as a whole. Price stability is actually strongly requested by the European citizens according to various surveys and opinion polls and they attach utmost importance to the independence of the ECB in delivering such objective </p><p>Addressing ‘unsatisfactory’ output growth performances in individual countries must be tackled by properly designed national policies in the fiscal and structural domains. Policies have to focus notably on increasing the adjustment capacity of economies to shocks and, in the slower growth countries, on fostering productivity and labour utilisation while maintaining stable macroeconomic conditions.</p><p>In this respect, fiscal policy, under the responsibility of national authorities, can best help in EMU by being sustainable and medium-term oriented, in line with the orientations provided by the Stability and Growth Pact. The Stability and Growth Pact is the key element of fiscal governance in the euro area. It provides a clear and transparent framework for putting into operation the reference values set by the Maastricht Treaty, 3% of GDP for fiscal deficits and 60% of GDP for public debt. Ensuring sound fiscal positions is necessary in order to compensate for the absence of a significant federal budget at the level of Europe that could absorb asymmetric shocks and in order to prevent the negative impact of unbalanced national fiscal policies. In a monetary union, such incentives could even be reinforced as part of the burden induced by fiscal imbalances in one country is indeed borne by all other members. The full and consistent implementation of the Pact sets the right incentives for countries to achieve sound fiscal positions. And countries with fiscal imbalances should use the current favourable economic environment to achieve such sound position rapidly. </p><p>In particular, the Pact calls on Member States to bring budget balances to their so called medium-term budgetary objectives and maintain them at that level. These objectives are designed to ensure the sustainability of the debt burden while providing sufficient leeway for budgetary fluctuations over the business cycle without jeopardising fiscal soundness. This free operation of so-called automatic stabilisers contributes to smooth economic fluctuations by letting the budget react to changes in the business cycle. In this way fiscal policies contribute to economic stability and support strong and sustainable economic growth. </p><p>Fiscal policy can and should also help mitigate undesirable trend growth differentials through “high quality” expenditure and tax policies. In particular, high and inefficient public expenditure can put a brake on economic activity by imposing a high tax burden on the economy and channelling resources into unproductive uses. Public spending and tax systems need to become more efficient and growth-friendly to strengthen trend growth. Such reforms will also facilitate the adjustment of the economies in case of adverse shocks.</p><p>By contrast, the pursuit of “activist” fiscal policies to fine-tune the economic cycle entails significant risks: an ill-timed fiscal policy stance can be an important source of variability in the economy. It is thus desirable that governments, as a rule, abstain from discretionary fiscal policy aimed at fine-tuning the economic cycle. Especially in the current economic environment, it is important that governments prevent discretionary policy measures from contributing pro-cyclically to the business cycle.</p><p>It is in the area of structural reforms where national policies can make the most significant contribution to facilitating the working of adjustment mechanisms in individual countries and to improving long-term growth and employment prospects as well as to addressing undesirable growth underperformance in some countries. In this regard, the Lisbon process has raised the awareness among European countries that structural reforms are decisive for remaining competitive in an increasingly global economic environment. The Integrated Guidelines outlining reform and policy priorities as well as the setting-up of National Reform Programmes are suitable instruments to lead the way to a well-functioning internal market as well as to better functioning national markets. In this respect, we appreciate the inclusion of a special euro area fiche into the Integrated Guidelines, highlighting the particular reform necessities of countries that participate in the euro area. </p><p>Let me briefly elaborate in more detail on these important issues.</p><p>First, the focus must be on structural reforms enhancing economic flexibility. This should help to better absorb shocks and thereby improve the working of adjustment mechanisms in individual countries. In the context of EMU with a single monetary policy, the later the necessary national policy measures are taken to make the economies more flexible, the larger the potential costs can be in case of adverse shocks.</p><p>How to enhance economic flexibility? There are many factors that may help to increase flexibility within the euro area. First, the Single Market needs to be completed in order to stimulate price flexibility by fostering competition and open product markets, e.g. in the services and network industries. This requires that existing barriers to labour and capital mobility within the euro area are removed. In this respect, measures aimed at protecting domestic industries or employees against competition are only counterproductive as they delay the necessary adjustment. Now that Slovenia has entered it the euro area, it is decisive that its labour force is granted full access to the labour markets of all euro area countries. As I have already stressed in several occasions, it is abnormal that there are labour restrictions as regards Slovenian workers in a number of economies that are members of the euro area.</p><p>Economic flexibility can also be promoted by removing the institutional barriers to flexible price and wage setting mechanisms, in particular by easing product market regulations and employment protection legislation.</p><p>Specifically, as regards wage setting, nominal and real wages should adjust to help absorb shocks. Wage setting must reflect firms’ different situations rather than being defined homogenously across sectors or countries independently of the local conditions to the risk of a higher level of unemployment. It is consequently of particular importance for all countries to achieve a high degree of wage flexibility in order to improve the ability of their labour markets to adjust to such shocks. </p><p>Secondly, national policies should aim at improving long-term growth prospects by, on the one hand, affecting positively labour utilisation and, on the other, improving labour productivity growth.</p><p>Structural policies can increase labour utilisation by addressing labour supply incentives that are inherent in tax and benefit systems. High average and marginal tax rates and high unemployment benefits impact negatively on the incentives to engage in paid employment or on the choice of the number of hours to work. Early retirement policies also have a significant negative effect on labour supply and, hence, on the participation and employment rates.</p><p>Growth in labour productivity should be supported by policies that aim at promoting innovation and technological change. For that purpose, policies should focus on allowing the efficient functioning of entrepreneurial activities, removing for instance entry restrictions and improving labour market adaptability.</p><p>Speaking in front of elected representatives, I know that the successful implementation of structural reforms requires constant explanations and well targeted communication in order to convince the citizens about their beneficial effects on growth and job creations; I fully understand the difficulty of this task and can only encourage all responsible parties in these communication efforts. </p><p>I am fully aware that this is indeed a very demanding list of tasks. But this is in our view the only way ahead. There is indeed enormous work to be done by all of us. And I would like to stress ‘by all of us’. We have, the Eurosystem, the European Commission, the national governments, and the European and national Parliaments, a shared responsibility in ensuring a smooth functioning of EMU, by improving the integration and flexibility of its markets. Some differences in economic performances across countries or regions have existed and will continue to exist in the future, as it is the case in the US and in other any areas. </p><p>317 millions d’Européens ont décidé de partager aujourd’hui un destin en commun. La monnaie unique n’est pas seulement une formidable réussite et le symbole puissant de l’unité de l’Europe dans un monde en voie de transformation rapide. La monnaie unique nous réunit plus profondément, plus intimement que le débat public européen ne le suggère parfois. 13 pays aujourd’hui et 25 pays demain ou après-demain ont décidé d’unir leur destin. Ces 25 démocraties ont démocratiquement approuvé les dispositions qui les unissent. Ces dispositions ne sont pas inscrites sur un chiffon de papier. Elles sont inscrites dans un traité international qui engage tous ceux qui l’ont ratifié au terme d’un processus exemplaire. Mes collègues du Directoire, du Conseil des Gouverneurs et moi-même, nous mesurons pleinement la confiance et l’honneur qui nous ont été faits de définir et mettre en oeuvre la politique monétaire de l’euro, en toute indépendance, pour assurer la stabilité des prix conformément au Traité. C’est ce double sentiment de confiance et de responsabilité qui nous anime.</p><p>Reproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.</p><p> </p><p>Media contacts</p><p> </p>",entr
Jean-Claude Trichet: Ehrenplaquette of the city of Frankfurt am Main – awarding ceremony,15-09-2008,European Central Bank,ECB,1636,"Dear Mrs. Mayor, Dear City Council Chairman, esteemed representatives of the Consular Corps, Ladies and Gentlemen,here Römer in Frankfurt I have since I took office as President of the European Central Bank has often been almost five years ago and spoke to invited guests. Today I am particularly pleased to take the floor. I would like to thank wholeheartedly that the city of Frankfurt distinguishes me with their honorary plaque. Central banks a home within its walls. So initially the bank of German countries, the Deutsche Bundesbank and since 1998 also the European Central Bank.For the award, which is given here to me today, my thanks first of my colleagues on the Board of the European Central Bank and the staff applies. They all made your sustainable use in order to make cooperation with the City of Frankfurt in as constructive and professional manner and have made possible by your personal commitment to contribute to the cultural life of this city only. This joint effort is the basis for this distinction, the award of ""honorary plaque of Frankfurt"". I am happy to be me add to this series of governors who have received the Plaque of Honour of the City of Frankfurt in front of me, including my much too soon deceased predecessor Willem F. Duisenberg  Let briefly on the first ten years of existence of the European Central me now.Ten years ago, on 1 June 1998, the European Central Bank was founded, together with the European System of Central Banks, the ESCB. The primary mandate of the ECB and the ESCB was, and is, to preserve price stability and to safeguard the credibility of Europe's single currency, the euro, which was created seven months later. It was the will of the democracies of Europe that led to the creation of the ECB . Its mandate and its independence in fulfilling its mandate were given by the people of Europe on a multi-national and multi-partisan basis. We are faithful to our mandate because we are faithful to the democratic will of the Member States. What can we say now, after ten years?Since day one, the single currency has fully inherited the degree of credibility and confidence that was the privilege of the most credible national currencies before the euro. The credibility was such that the medium and long-term market rates of the euro were at the same low level as those experienced by the most reliable national currencies before. In spite of a series of global shocks resulting from the prices of oil and commodities, yearly inflation since 1 January 1999 has been 2.1% on average. Price stability in the medium term is essential not only because it protects the incomes of all our fellow citizens – and particularly the most vulnerable and poorest ones – but also because it is one of the preconditions for growth and job creation. Since the euro came into being about 16 million new jobs have been created, over one million more than on the other side of the Atlantic.The first ten years have been extremely busy for the Executive Board, for the Governing Council, for the ECB and for the Eurosystem. The extraordinary motivation of our staff members is, in my opinion, due to their awareness of, and pride in, making history. The single currency is the most advanced feature of European unity and in many respects its emblem. We owe it to the lucidity of the founding fathers and to the determination of a series of visionary leaders. To them we owe an immense debt of gratitude. Gratitude also to the leaders who maintained a steady hand during the 1990s in the run-up to the euro, in a very difficult environment. This anniversary is no time for complacency. But for continuous efforts, because the challenges lying ahead for Monetary Union will be numerous and demanding. As one of the major central banks in the industrialised world, we, like the others, have three challenges to cope with in our monetary policy-making: rapid technological progress, globalisation in all its dimensions, including the transformation of global finance, and population ageing. On top of those three major challenges, the ECB and the Eurosystem have to cope with two other important, self-assigned challenges. The first is the deepening of economic and financial integration at continental level, the progressive completion of a single economy with a single currency; we are the only central bank which is actively contributing to a major structural transformation of its own economy. The second is enlargement: we are called upon to extend progressively the euro area across the European Union as a whole; we are also the only central bank to undertake such an endeavour.Economic Union itself has its own challenges. I see three major challenges for the Eurogroup, for the governments of the euro area and for the Commission. The full and complete implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, which is a crucial component of EMU in the absence of a European federal budget. The resolute pursuit of structural reforms in line with the Lisbon process, which are decisive in order to raise the long-term growth potential of Europe. And the lucid monitoring of the national competitive indicators, including unit labour costs. Europe can count on the ECB and on the Eurosystem to implement in this century the historic task which was assigned to us at the end of the last century. We will be faithful to the primary mandate given to us by the Treaty. We know that our fellow citizens are asking us to deliver price stability. We know also that price stability is a prerequisite for financial stability, a very important objective at the current juncture. All the members of the Governing Council make their decisions taking into account the interests of the whole of the euro area, of 15 countries. We do not consider any particular country, but all 15 of them. And as I said, in the current juncture there is no place for complacevcy but for permanent credible alertness.During its first ten years the ECB has developed excellent relations with its environment here in Frankfurt, be it with the institutions of the city or with the population. At the beginning there were still some taxi drivers who did not understand immediately where to bring a passenger who just said: “European Central Bank, please”. Today, the situation is quite different. And the ECB has endeavoured to spread the knowledge of what is happening in there. We do that via our publications or our Website but also by inviting the public to come inside the ECB. Therefore, we participated in the Skyscraper festivals of 2001 and 2007, following the example of our forerunner, the European Monetary Institute which did so in 1996 and 1998. In the framework of our 10th anniversary we held an Open Day on 1 June, and about 1,000 visitors could get first hand information of the role and functions of the ECB. In addition, we regularly explain our work to groups of visitors from around the world, and among them of course citizens from Frankfurt and the Rhein-Main area. In 2007 their number reached 13,500 altogether and each visitor did not only see the ECB but also the city of Frankfurt. For completeness, I wish to also mention our taking part in the Osthafenfest and in the Luminale, during which the Großmarkthalle was fantastically illuminated. Also, ECB staff participated in dragon boat races and got the enthusiastic support from the public and their colleagues on the banks of the Main.The ECB is a European body, and its staff is now composed of nationals from the 27 Member States of the European Union. Every day, I enjoy the multi-cultural atmosphere at the ECB which is stimulating as it brings fresh ideas into our professional life because of the different experiences, work styles and cultural backgrounds only to name a few of the inspiring factors. Our daily encounter with the richness of European heritage brought us to the thought to let the public participate in this understanding. We did so by launching the Cultural Days of the European Central Bank which we have organised every year since 2003. The basic concept is to feature each time aspects of the variety and affluence of the culture of one of the Member States of the European Union, and bring it to Frankfurt to present it to the citizens of the Rhine-Main region and beyond, with events covering music, literature, film, and modern dance. Furthermore, we offer lectures about different topics, art and photographic exhibitions and events for children. After having started with Portugal in 2003, it was Poland’s turn in 2004, followed in 2005 by Hungary, in 2006 by Austria and in 2007 by Greece. This year we did not focus on the culture of only one Member State but presented for our 10th birthday a kaleidoscope of the culture of all 27 EU countries in a combination of different events. In 2009 we will return to the traditional pattern and have selected Romania as the next single country. In the organisation of the Cultural Days the ECB can rely in particular on the precious support from the central banks of the relevant theme countries which are, among other things, an important factor in the selection and financing of the programme. However, we have over the years also extremely well cooperated with the city of Frankfurt, and I wish to thank the Lord Mayor and the other members of the city government or parliament very, very much for their assistance and contributions to the Cultural Days which I hope have enriched the international flavour of the city.Dear Mrs. Mayor, ladies and gentlemen, the ECB, its management and its employees feel ten years in Frankfurt very well. Thank you again sincerely for honoring that I very gladly take on behalf of the Board and our employees.Thank you for your attention.Reproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.

Frau Oberbürgermeisterin, sehr geehrter Herr Stadtverordnetenvorsteher, hochgeschätzte Vertreter des Konsularischen Corps, meine Damen und Herren,</p><p>hier im Frankfurter Römer habe ich seit meinem Amtsantritt als Präsident der Europäischen Zentralbank vor bald fünf Jahren schon öfter gestanden und zu geladenen Gästen gesprochen. Heute freue ich mich ganz besonders, das Wort zu ergreifen. Ich möchte mich aus ganzem Herzen dafür zu bedanken, dass die Stadt Frankfurt mich mit ihrer Ehrenplakette auszeichnet. Zentralbanken eine Heimat in seinen Mauern. So zunächst der Bank deutscher Länder, dann der Deutschen Bundesbank und seit 1998 außerdem der Europäischen Zentralbank.</p><p>Für die Auszeichnung, die mir heute hier zuteil wird, gilt mein Dank zunächst meinen Kollegen im Direktorium der Europäischen Zentralbank und den Mitarbeitern. Sie alle haben Ihren nachhaltigen Einsatz geleistet, um die Zusammenarbeit mit der Stadt Frankfurt in so konstruktiver und professioneller Weise zu gestalten und haben durch Ihr persönliches Engagement den Beitrag zum Kulturleben dieser Stadt erst ermöglicht. Diese gemeinsame Leistung ist die Grundlage für diese Ehrung, die Verleihung der „Ehrenplakette der Stadt Frankfurt“.</p><p> Ich bin glücklich, mich in die Reihe der Zentralbankpräsidenten einreihen zu dürfen, die vor mir die Ehrenplakette der Stadt Frankfurt erhalten haben, darunter mein leider viel zu früh verstorbener Vorgänger Willem F. Duisenberg </p><p> Lassen Sie mich nun kurz auf die ersten zehn Jahre der Existenz der Europäischen Zentralbank eingehen.</p><p>Ten years ago, on 1 June 1998, the European Central Bank was founded, together with the European System of Central Banks, the ESCB. The primary mandate of the ECB and the ESCB was, and is, to preserve price stability and to safeguard the credibility of Europe's single currency, the euro, which was created seven months later. </p><p>It was the will of the democracies of Europe that led to the creation of the ECB . Its mandate and its independence in fulfilling its mandate were given by the people of Europe on a multi-national and multi-partisan basis. We are faithful to our mandate because we are faithful to the democratic will of the Member States. </p><p>What can we say now, after ten years?</p><p>Since day one, the single currency has fully inherited the degree of credibility and confidence that was the privilege of the most credible national currencies before the euro. The credibility was such that the medium and long-term market rates of the euro were at the same low level as those experienced by the most reliable national currencies before. In spite of a series of global shocks resulting from the prices of oil and commodities, yearly inflation since 1 January 1999 has been 2.1% on average. Price stability in the medium term is essential not only because it protects the incomes of all our fellow citizens – and particularly the most vulnerable and poorest ones – but also because it is one of the preconditions for growth and job creation. Since the euro came into being about 16 million new jobs have been created, over one million more than on the other side of the Atlantic.</p><p>The first ten years have been extremely busy for the Executive Board, for the Governing Council, for the ECB and for the Eurosystem. The extraordinary motivation of our staff members is, in my opinion, due to their awareness of, and pride in, making history. </p><p>The single currency is the most advanced feature of European unity and in many respects its emblem. We owe it to the lucidity of the founding fathers and to the determination of a series of visionary leaders. To them we owe an immense debt of gratitude. Gratitude also to the leaders who maintained a steady hand during the 1990s in the run-up to the euro, in a very difficult environment. </p><p>This anniversary is no time for complacency. But for continuous efforts, because the challenges lying ahead for Monetary Union will be numerous and demanding. As one of the major central banks in the industrialised world, we, like the others, have three challenges to cope with in our monetary policy-making: rapid technological progress, globalisation in all its dimensions, including the transformation of global finance, and population ageing. </p><p>On top of those three major challenges, the ECB and the Eurosystem have to cope with two other important, self-assigned challenges. The first is the deepening of economic and financial integration at continental level, the progressive completion of a single economy with a single currency; we are the only central bank which is actively contributing to a major structural transformation of its own economy. The second is enlargement: we are called upon to extend progressively the euro area across the European Union as a whole; we are also the only central bank to undertake such an endeavour.</p><p>Economic Union itself has its own challenges. I see three major challenges for the Eurogroup, for the governments of the euro area and for the Commission. The full and complete implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, which is a crucial component of EMU in the absence of a European federal budget. The resolute pursuit of structural reforms in line with the Lisbon process, which are decisive in order to raise the long-term growth potential of Europe. And the lucid monitoring of the national competitive indicators, including unit labour costs. </p><p>Europe can count on the ECB and on the Eurosystem to implement in this century the historic task which was assigned to us at the end of the last century. We will be faithful to the primary mandate given to us by the Treaty. We know that our fellow citizens are asking us to deliver price stability. We know also that price stability is a prerequisite for financial stability, a very important objective at the current juncture. All the members of the Governing Council make their decisions taking into account the interests of the whole of the euro area, of 15 countries. We do not consider any particular country, but all 15 of them. And as I said, in the current juncture there is no place for complacevcy but for permanent credible alertness.</p><p>During its first ten years the ECB has developed excellent relations with its environment here in Frankfurt, be it with the institutions of the city or with the population. At the beginning there were still some taxi drivers who did not understand immediately where to bring a passenger who just said: “European Central Bank, please”. Today, the situation is quite different. And the ECB has endeavoured to spread the knowledge of what is happening in there. We do that via our publications or our Website but also by inviting the public to come inside the ECB. Therefore, we participated in the Skyscraper festivals of 2001 and 2007, following the example of our forerunner, the European Monetary Institute which did so in 1996 and 1998. In the framework of our 10th anniversary we held an Open Day on 1 June, and about 1,000 visitors could get first hand information of the role and functions of the ECB. In addition, we regularly explain our work to groups of visitors from around the world, and among them of course citizens from Frankfurt and the Rhein-Main area. In 2007 their number reached 13,500 altogether and each visitor did not only see the ECB but also the city of Frankfurt. For completeness, I wish to also mention our taking part in the Osthafenfest and in the Luminale, during which the Großmarkthalle was fantastically illuminated. Also, ECB staff participated in dragon boat races and got the enthusiastic support from the public and their colleagues on the banks of the Main.</p><p>The ECB is a European body, and its staff is now composed of nationals from the 27 Member States of the European Union. Every day, I enjoy the multi-cultural atmosphere at the ECB which is stimulating as it brings fresh ideas into our professional life because of the different experiences, work styles and cultural backgrounds only to name a few of the inspiring factors. Our daily encounter with the richness of European heritage brought us to the thought to let the public participate in this understanding. We did so by launching the Cultural Days of the European Central Bank which we have organised every year since 2003. The basic concept is to feature each time aspects of the variety and affluence of the culture of one of the Member States of the European Union, and bring it to Frankfurt to present it to the citizens of the Rhine-Main region and beyond, with events covering music, literature, film, and modern dance. Furthermore, we offer lectures about different topics, art and photographic exhibitions and events for children. After having started with Portugal in 2003, it was Poland’s turn in 2004, followed in 2005 by Hungary, in 2006 by Austria and in 2007 by Greece. This year we did not focus on the culture of only one Member State but presented for our 10th birthday a kaleidoscope of the culture of all 27 EU countries in a combination of different events. In 2009 we will return to the traditional pattern and have selected Romania as the next single country. </p><p>In the organisation of the Cultural Days the ECB can rely in particular on the precious support from the central banks of the relevant theme countries which are, among other things, an important factor in the selection and financing of the programme. However, we have over the years also extremely well cooperated with the city of Frankfurt, and I wish to thank the Lord Mayor and the other members of the city government or parliament very, very much for their assistance and contributions to the Cultural Days which I hope have enriched the international flavour of the city.</p><p>Sehr geehrter Frau Oberbürgermeisterin, meine Damen und Herren, die EZB, ihr Management und ihre Belegschaft fühlen sich seit zehn Jahren in Frankfurt sehr wohl. Ich danke Ihnen nochmals aufrichtig für die Ehrung, die ich sehr gerne im Namen des Direktoriums und unserer Mitarbeiter entgegennehme. </p><p>Vielen Dank für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit.</p><p>Reproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.</p><p> </p><p>Media contacts</p><p> </p>",entr
Jean-Claude Trichet: Introductory to the European Parliament,09-07-2008,European Central Bank,ECB,1944,"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, it is my great honor to present you - as foreseen in the Treaty - the 2007 Annual Report of the ECB. But as you know, relations between Parliament and the ECB go well beyond the obligations imposed by the Treaty. In fact, we have established over the years a very close dialogue. This is the fourth time this year that I stand before you. Similarly, my colleagues in the Management Board of the ECB have been in close contact with the European Parliament on various issues, such as enlargement of the euro zone, payment systems and the tenth anniversary of Economic and Monetary Union . I am pleased that, according to the proposed resolution, dialogue between Parliament and the ECB has been successful.I'll start by giving you a brief overview of the economic developments in the years 2007/2008 and explain the monetary policy of the ECB. After that I would like to make some comments on points and proposals that you have raised in your draft resolution on the 2007 Annual Report of the ECB.In 2007, the ECB operated in a challenging environment, with rising and volatile commodity prices and, since the second half of 2007, heightened uncertainty stemming from the ongoing correction in financial markets across the world. Despite these developments, the euro area economy continued to expand at solid rates in 2007, with annual real GDP growing by 2.7%.In the first half of 2008, moderate ongoing growth in real GDP has continued, although the quarter-on-quarter profile is likely to show significant volatility, owing to temporary, in part weather-related, factors. It is thus important to focus on the medium-term trend when assessing growth developments. Looking ahead, on the external side, growth in emerging countries should remain robust, supporting euro area foreign demand. On the domestic side, the economic fundamentals of the euro area remain sound and the euro area does not suffer from major imbalances. Moreover, employment rates and labour force participation have increased significantly in recent years, and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. That being said, the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for growth remains high, with downside risks mainly relating to further unanticipated increases in commodity prices, possible further spillovers from continuing tensions in financial market to the real economy and increasing protectionist tendencies. Turning to price developments, in 2007 average annual HICP inflation in the euro area was 2.1%, slightly above the ECB’s definition of price stability. However, towards the end of the year, substantial increases in international oil and food prices brought inflation to levels well above 2%. Since then inflation in the euro area has risen further and, in the wake of renewed sharp commodity price increases, arrived at the worrying levels of around 4% in mid 2008. Looking ahead, the annual HICP inflation rate is likely to remain well above the level consistent with price stability for some time, moderating only gradually in 2009. Risks to price stability over the medium term remained clearly on the upside in 2007 and have intensified over recent months. These risks include possible further rises in commodity prices and unanticipated increases in indirect taxes and administered prices. In addition, the Governing Council is strongly concerned that price and wage-setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures through broadly-based second-round effects. First signs are already emerging in some regions of the euro area. In this context, indexation schemes for nominal wages are of particular concern and should be avoided. As in 2007, the monetary analysis in the first half of 2008 has continued to confirm the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. In line with our monetary policy strategy, we take the view that the sustained underlying strength of monetary and credit expansion in the euro area over the past few years has created upside risks to price stability. Over recent quarters, these risks appear to have become manifest as inflation has trended upwards. Against this background, the continued strength of monetary dynamics represents an important signal of the risks to price stability over the medium term that we have been addressing through our actions since end-2005. Moreover, a thorough assessment of available data suggests that the ongoing financial market correction has, as yet, not significantly affected the availability of bank credit. To contain prevailing upside risks to price stability over the medium term the Governing Council further adjusted the monetary policy stance in March and June 2007. After a period of unusually high uncertainty in the context of the financial market correction, in July 2008 the Governing Council has brought the minimum bid rate in the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations to 4.25%. This action underlines the Governing Council’s strong determination to prevent second-round effects and maintain longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability. This is the contribution of the ECB’s monetary policy to preserving purchasing power over the medium term and supporting sustainable growth and employment in the euro area.Following last week’s decision to raise rates, in the Governing Council’s current assessment the monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving price stability over the medium term. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.Mister President, honourable members of the European Parliament, in your draft resolution you raise a large number of issues of relevance to the ECB. I would like to assure you that we will consider your remarks and requests with great care and report back to you accordingly. I will now briefly elaborate on some of these points.I would like to start by welcoming the positive assessment made by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy. Our two-pillar framework ensures that all information relevant for the assessment of risks to price stability is taken into account in a consistent and systematic manner when taking monetary policy decisions. In particular, the monetary analysis guarantees that the ECB’s monetary policy is oriented to the medium to longer term. Given the close link between monetary developments and evolving imbalances in credit and asset markets, the monetary analysis has proven a particularly valuable asset in times of financial distress. In 2007 the Governing Council has launched within the Eurosystem a research agenda to enhance further its monetary analysis, as is also proposed in the draft resolution to continue to improve the ECB’s analytical infrastructure.I would also like to welcome the Committee’s recognition that making the minutes of the ECB Governing Council’s meetings available to the public would not be advisable. Such a measure would draw attention to individual positions when in a euro area of 15 – and very soon 16 – countries, what counts is the position of the collegial decision maker, the Governing Council. It could also lead to pressures on Governing Council members to abandon their necessarily euro area perspective when taking monetary policy decisions. As already emphasised on previous occasions, I see the Introductory Statement I present on behalf of the Governing Council at the monthly press conference as an equivalent to what other central banks call “summary minutes”. Together with the ensuing Q&A session, the Introductory Statement provides in real time a comprehensive overview, on the part of the Governing Council, of the current monetary policy stance. This communication instrument has served us very well in guiding financial market expectations.As regards fiscal policies, the ECB shares the view expressed in the draft resolution that all Member States must fully respect the Stability and Growth Pact. However, after the decline of the past four years, a renewed increase in the euro area aggregate fiscal deficit ratio is projected for 2008. There is a clear risk that some countries will not comply with the provisions of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact. Achieving sound and sustainable budgetary positions and on this basis allowing the free operation of automatic stabilisers is the best contribution fiscal policy can make to macroeconomic stability.The draft resolution also refers to the risks posed by economic differentials across euro area countries, which to some extent reflect structural rigidities and/or inappropriate national policies. It goes without saying that economic divergences across euro area countries cannot be addressed by monetary policy. In order to avoid a protracted period of either low growth and high unemployment or overheating, as a country responds to asymmetric shocks, reforms to enhance the resilience to such shocks should be undertaken at the national level. These include well designed structural reforms to enhance competition, increase productivity and foster labour market flexibility. Greater flexibility in euro area labour markets and wages would reduce adjustment costs and inflation pressures in the event of adverse supply shocks and would augment the economy’s resilience, thus limiting employment losses and facilitating the conduct of the stability-oriented monetary policy of the ECB. Let me emphasise again that there is a need for a lucid monitoring of national competitiveness developments, including unit labour costs, as recouping ex post a loss of competitiveness is a difficult exercise. In this regard, we support the Parliament’s call for responsible wage policies.Let me now turn to the issues highlighted by the financial market correction for crisis prevention and crisis management, which also figure prominently in your draft resolution. As regards crisis prevention, the market correction highlighted issues for both supervisors and central banks. Supervisors should make further efforts to reinforce cooperation and exchange of information on a cross-border basis. To that end, it is of crucial importance to further exploit the potential of the Lamfalussy framework. The Ecofin Council has agreed on certain measures to that end, and attention should now shift towards implementing them. Let me mention in this context that the market correction has not provided any convincing evidence for an overhaul of the current supervisory framework, for instance through the setting up of a new authority for EU supervision. Central banks, including the ECB, have to a great extent been effective in identifying the weaknesses and risks to the financial system that materialised as the turmoil unfolded. Such warnings may be found, for instance, in many past issues of the ECB Financial Stability Review. In this context, the ECB also recognises the need to further enhance cooperation between central banks and supervisors which could entail the use of supervisory information to enrich financial stability assessments, and the translation of such assessments into tangible supervisory action.Looking to lessons for crisis management, a main issue that emerged during the turmoil concerns the need for a smooth flow of information between central banks and supervisors during the unfolding of a crisis. Central banks may need supervisory information for the effective performance of their functions in the management of a crisis, such as money market interventions, provision of Emergency Liquidity Assistance, and financial stability monitoring. This applies to the Eurosystem as well. Supervisors from their side may benefit from central bank information, for instance as regards banks’ liquidity positions. Therefore, the envisaged reinforcement of the EU legal basis for information exchange between central banks and supervisors is strongly supported by the ECB. My final remarks concern the integration of Europe’s payment systems. The ECB noted with satisfaction the positive assessments in the draft resolution about SEPA and TARGET2. Concerning the Eurosystem’s TARGET2-Securities initiative, the Governing Council will in the coming weeks decide on the continuation of the T2S project. It is important to note that all major CSDs have responded positively to our initiative.I thank you very much for your attention. I am now available to answer your questions.

annuel 2007 de la BCE. Mais comme vous le savez, les relations entre le Parlement et la BCE vont bien au-delà des obligations imposées par le Traité. De fait, nous avons établi, au fil des années, un dialogue très étroit. C’est la quatrième fois cette année que j’interviens devant vous. De même, mes collègues au sein du Directoire de la BCE ont été en contact étroit avec le Parlement Européen concernant diverses questions, telles que l’élargissement de la zone euro, les systèmes de paiement et le dixième anniversaire de l’Union monétaire et économique. Je constate avec plaisir que, selon la proposition de résolution, le dialogue entre le Parlement et la BCE a porté ses fruits. </p><p>Ich werde Ihnen zunächst einen kurzen Überblick über die wirtschaftlichen Entwicklungen in den Jahren 2007/2008 geben und die geldpolitischen Maßnahmen der EZB erläutern. Danach möchte ich einige Anmerkungen zu Punkten und Vorschlägen machen, die Sie in Ihrem Entwurf einer Entschließung zum Jahresbericht 2007 der EZB vorgebracht haben. </p><p>In 2007, the ECB operated in a challenging environment, with rising and volatile commodity prices and, since the second half of 2007, heightened uncertainty stemming from the ongoing correction in financial markets across the world.

Let me mention in this context that the market correction has not provided any convincing evidence for an overhaul of the current supervisory framework, for instance through the setting up of a new authority for EU supervision. </p><p>Central banks, including the ECB, have to a great extent been effective in identifying the weaknesses and risks to the financial system that materialised as the turmoil unfolded. Such warnings may be found, for instance, in many past issues of the ECB Financial Stability Review. In this context, the ECB also recognises the need to further enhance cooperation between central banks and supervisors which could entail the use of supervisory information to enrich financial stability assessments, and the translation of such assessments into tangible supervisory action.</p><p>Looking to lessons for </p><p>crisis management</p><p>, a main issue that emerged during the turmoil concerns the need for a smooth flow of information between central banks and supervisors during the unfolding of a crisis. Central banks may need supervisory information for the effective performance of their functions in the management of a crisis, such as money market interventions, provision of Emergency Liquidity Assistance, and financial stability monitoring. This applies to the Eurosystem as well. Supervisors from their side may benefit from central bank information, for instance as regards banks’ liquidity positions. Therefore, the envisaged reinforcement of the EU legal basis for information exchange between central banks and supervisors is strongly supported by the ECB. </p><p>My final remarks concern the integration of Europe’s payment systems. The ECB noted with satisfaction the positive assessments in the draft resolution about SEPA and TARGET2. Concerning the Eurosystem’s TARGET2-Securities initiative, the Governing Council will in the coming weeks decide on the continuation of the T2S project. It is important to note that all major CSDs have responded positively to our initiative.</p><p>I thank you very much for your attention.

Jean-Claude Trichet: Fostering sound financial globalisation: the role of Europe,02-07-2008,European Central Bank,ECB,4219,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Ladies and gentlemen,I am very pleased to speak today at the Financial Forum of Paris Europlace. First, let me clarify that my speech occurs during the ""purdah period"" preceding a meeting of the Board of Governors. Consequently, none of my comments should not be interpreted in terms of Governing Council's intentions on the direction of monetary policy and the level of interest rates. I will focus today on the role of Europe in the global financial markets. It is particularly appropriate to proceed with an assessment of the contribution within the global economy, the European capital markets. The events observed in capital markets for several months have reminded us of how the global financial system had become closely integrated. Financial globalization is an important factor of global economic dynamism and stability because it promotes an efficient allocation of capital and increases the possibilities of sharing and risk diversification. It should be that development takes place in an environment characterized by the efficiency and discipline. For this, we must all assume our responsibility to ensure safe and efficient operation of the global financial system.Europe is one of the major building blocks of the global economy and, as such, needs to play a very active role in fostering sound financial globalisation. I would like to highlight two main priorities in this respect.  First , we should further step up our efforts to build a truly integrated, safe and highly competitive European financial market. The tenth anniversary of the ECB one month ago gave us the occasion to take stock of the achievements in European financial integration over the past decade. We were proud to find that significant progress has been achieved and that the introduction of the single currency has acted as a major driving force in this regard. However, as I would like to underline today, further efforts are necessary to make the single financial market a reality. While financial integration is first and foremost a market-driven process, authorities can play an important supportive role in a number of ways, for instance by acting as catalysts for private sector initiatives and by reducing policy-related obstacles to cross-border finance. The Eurosystem can also provide central banking services that support the financial integration process. I will highlight a few areas, which, in my view, particularly merit further public sector action.  Second , Europe should also contribute actively to safeguarding the resilience of the global financial system. At the present juncture, the main priority in this regard is to address, from a systemic point of view, the global financial system weaknesses which have been identified during the ongoing financial market correction. At the same time, greater global interconnectedness will continue to necessitate substantial efforts towards enhanced international cooperation. I will mention a number of priority issues in this context.Let me begin with a brief review of the current state of European financial integration. Completing the single financial market is a key priority on the European economic agenda for a number of reasons. First, an integrated financial market is a prerequisite for realising the full economic potential of Europe, as highlighted in the Lisbon strategy. A study by London Economics estimates that the integration of the European bond and equity markets could result in additional GDP growth of around 1% over a ten-year period, or approximately 100 billion euro. [1] Second, financial integration is also a crucial element in the safe and efficient functioning of the monetary union. In particular, financial markets that are more integrated provide strong support for the effective transmission of the single monetary policy and the smooth operation of the underlying payment systems. By enhancing the depth and liquidity of financial markets, integration also enhances the resilience of the European financial system. The ECB has, therefore, always been a strong supporter of the European financial integration process and we have monitored the respective developments very closely. Based on a set of quantitative indicators, we review the state of financial integration in the money, bond, equity and banking markets in our annual report on Financial Integration in Europe. The second issue of this report was published last April. [2]Our findings show that European financial integration has advanced significantly since the introduction of the single currency. However, the progress made differs across financial market segments. In particular, integration is more advanced in those segments that are closer to the single monetary policy and it also depends on the integration of the underlying market infrastructures. The euro area unsecured money markets score well in both of these respects. It is therefore not surprising that these markets reached a stage of near-perfect integration almost immediately after the introduction of the euro, when the cross-country standard deviation of the unsecured interbank lending rates rapidly decreased to an almost negligible level of two to three basis points. The collateralised money markets are also well integrated. Although there was a slight increase in the standard deviation of unsecured rates during the financial market correction, the fact that collateralised rates have not reacted in a similar way suggests that the reason lies in an increased variability of credit risk among banks rather than in growing cross-border market segmentation.The close integration of large-value payment systems has been instrumental in achieving and sustaining money market integration. TARGET, the Eurosystem’s real-time gross settlement facility for euro payments, became operational in January 1999 and since then has enabled the safe and efficient euro-area wide handling of interbank payment transactions. The move to a single shared platform with TARGET2, which on 19 May 2008 fully replaced the former TARGET system, will render wholesale euro payments even more integrated and efficient.  Bond and equity markets also show clear signs of integration, especially the government bond markets. Progress has also been achieved in the corporate bond markets and, to a lesser extent, in equity markets. Both bond yields and equity returns are increasingly driven by common factors and the cross-border shares of bond and equity holdings have been growing to 60% and one third of total holdings, respectively. This suggests that euro area investors are progressively diversifying their portfolios on a cross-border basis. At the same time, country-specific factors still play an important role, especially in corporate bond and equity markets. A key obstacle to greater bond and equity market integration is the lack of a sufficiently integrated infrastructure for securities clearing and settlement in the EU.Substantial progress has also been made on the integration of banking markets, namely in the wholesale and capital market-related segments. Cross-border interbank loans have increased to almost a quarter of total interbank loans and euro area banks’ holdings of securities issued by banks in other euro area countries have almost tripled over the past decade. By contrast, retail banking markets have remained fragmented so far. For instance, the cross-border share of loans to non-banks has more or less stagnated at a very low level, below 5%. Similarly, the cross-country dispersion of banks’ interest rates on loans to non-financial corporations and households has remained relatively high, especially with regard to consumer loans. Further efforts are needed to complete the single financial market, particularly in those areas where integration is currently lagging behind, namely in the corporate bond, equity and retail banking markets. While I would like to highlight again the primary role of market-led action in this respect, public authorities should nevertheless strive to facilitate progress. I see three main priorities at the current juncture, namely to: (i) further enhance the EU institutional setting for financial regulation and supervision; (ii) remove obstacles to cross-border securities clearing and settlement; and (iii) enhance the EU regulatory framework and market infrastructure for retail banking.The European financial integration process presents a twin challenge for the EU regulatory and supervisory architecture. First, closer convergence of prudential rules and supervisory practices is needed in order to facilitate the efficient operation of cross-border financial institutions and to safeguard an effective pan-European level playing field. Second, while financial integration increases the overall shock-absorbing capacity of the financial system it also increases the likelihood that financial risks may be cross-border in origin or nature. Against this background closer cross-border cooperation in monitoring and addressing financial risks is of the essence. The EU has already taken important steps to foster regulatory and supervisory convergence and cooperation in recent years. The introduction of an enhanced institutional setting for financial regulation and supervision with the Lamfalussy framework has been a milestone in this respect, coupled with improvements to the EU legislative framework for financial services, including in particular the adoption of the Financial Services Action Plan and the respective follow-up policy for the period 2005-2010. However, the first full review of the Lamfalussy framework by ECOFIN in December 2007 demonstrated that the new institutional setting has not yet reached its full potential. While the review confirmed the widely shared assessment that the Lamfalussy framework has greatly enhanced the EU regulatory and supervisory process in recent years, it also underlined that the optimal level of cross-border convergence and cooperation has not yet been attained. In order to move forward, the December 2007 ECOFIN pointed to the need to: (i) strengthen the roles, tools and decision-making procedures of the EU committees of supervisors; (ii) enhance the supervisory arrangements for cross-border financial groups by improving the functioning of the supervisory colleges formed by the competent home and host supervisors; and (iii) consider introducing a reference to the EU in the mandates of national supervisors. The ECOFIN Council set out a specific roadmap for achieving progress on these issues by the end of 2008. The Eurosystem strongly supports these initiatives. Indeed, from the inception of the Lamfalussy framework we have argued that this innovative institutional approach provides an appropriate basis for achieving the heightened degree of cross-border convergence and cooperation which is required. One of the key advantages of the Lamfalussy approach is the combination of a decentralised set-up with cross-border coordination at EU level. A decentralised approach is in line with the national responsibilities for safeguarding financial stability – relating not only to financial regulation and supervision, but also to financial stability monitoring and assessment, crisis management, and deposit insurance – while also allowing for the benefits of geographical proximity and the established experience and knowledge of local authorities to be drawn upon. At the same time, it is clear that the accompanying coordinating mechanisms need to be sufficiently strong, and this has not been the case so far. Therefore, a key priority on the EU financial services policy agenda is the effective and timely implementation of the measures that will allow the full benefits of the Lamfalussy framework to be reaped.Let me now turn to the work underway on enhancing securities clearing and settlement that is underway in Europe  Given the existing fragmentation of the securities market infrastructure the post-trading costs of cross-border securities transactions in the EU are excessively high and this constitutes an important impediment to the enhanced integration of European bond and equity markets. A number of initiatives have been launched to achieve progress in this field, relating in particular to the implementation of the industry’s Code of Conduct and the removal of the so-called Giovannini barriers. A crucial complementary step towards an integrated European securities market infrastructure would be to establish a common securities settlement platform. This is the objective of the Eurosystem’s TARGET2-Securities (T2S) initiative. Under T2S, cross-border transactions will be settled at the same price and as efficiently as domestic transactions. Moreover, the T2S settlement cost will be significantly lower even than the cost today of domestic transactions. If T2S existed now, the average settlement cost could be reduced very substantially. If the geographical scope of T2S were extended beyond the euro area, substantial further cost savings would be achieved. In addition to the pure settlement cost, banks and other users would also enjoy substantial back office and collateral savings. The details of the economic impact analysis of T2S are set out in the proposal by the ECB’s Governing Council’s proposal for all European central securities depositories to join the T2S project. This proposal also includes the user requirements that have been developed in close co-operation with hundreds of experts from central securities depositories (CSDs), banks and central banks. The entire documentation, which was sent to the CSDs on 23 May 2008, is available on the ECB’s website. The Governing Council has invited all European CSDs to express their views with regard to their participation in T2S by 4 July 2008 and will subsequently decide whether to proceed with the project.While the Code of Conduct, the removal of the Giovannini barriers and T2S are different lines of work, they all aim at enhancing the efficiency of post-trading services in Europe. They are complemented by the ESCB-CESR recommendations, which aim to ensure the safety and soundness of EU post-trading activities.Finally, I would like to make a few remarks on further steps to promote retail banking integration. Again, a multi-pronged approach is most promising in this regard. For instance, the European Commission, as part of its financial services policy for the years 2005-2010, is pursuing a number of initiatives to overcome both regulatory and market-based barriers in this field. In addition, it is expected that the above mentioned initiatives to streamline the regulatory and supervisory interface for cross-border financial institutions will foster an enhanced cross-border provision of banking services, including in the retail segment. Furthermore, in January 2008 the market-led initiative to establish a Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) was launched, which aims at achieving a fully integrated market for retail payment services in the euro area via harmonised technical standards and market practices, with no distinction between cross-border and national payments. The main priority at the current juncture is for all stakeholders to make every possible effort to achieve the full and timely implementation of SEPA in order to ensure that a critical mass of retail payments will be made on the basis of SEPA instruments by end 2010. As ECOFIN concluded in January this year, public authorities have an important catalytic function in driving the migration process to SEPA forward, namely by supporting and explaining SEPA in their communication with their national constituencies. In addition to this political task, they also have an operational role to play in becoming early users of SEPA products and services. As initiators and receivers of high volumes of payment transactions, public authorities – such as national and local administrations, tax authorities, social security agencies and pension funds – are key stakeholders which can make SEPA a success. We have noted that there is still a lack of information and awareness about SEPA among the public at large. Greater effort should be made to communicate the benefits of SEPA to corporate enterprises and private customers at European and national levels. While we expect that the critical mass of retail payments will have moved to SEPA payments by the end of 2010 on a voluntary basis, an official end-date for the migration period may need to be set, by which time the use of national credit transfers and direct debits should have been phased out. Recent studies by the ECB and the European Commission have clearly shown that a lengthy period of processing the old national and the new SEPA instruments in parallel will be costly for both banks and their customers. Therefore, this period of dual processing should be kept as short as possible. Financial integration is proceeding not only within Europe, but also at the global level. Financial globalisation enables the international community to share significant benefits in terms of enhanced financial efficiency and economic growth, but it also makes the safeguarding of financial stability a more interdependent endeavour. Effectively coordinated international action aimed at addressing financial system vulnerabilities has therefore become very important, as highlighted during the ongoing financial market correction.Against this background, the major collective effort undertaken by both the public and the private sector to cope with the financial market turbulences has been encouraging. Hard work has been done in terms of restoring the orderly functioning of financial markets in the short term and identifying proper measures to strengthen the resilience of the financial system in the longer term in order to avoid the recurrence of similar events in the future. The report of the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) on “Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience” [3] has been fully endorsed by the international community and provides the main reference point for the necessary improvements. In this context, let me briefly point out that enhancements will be required in a number of areas, with particular focus on (i) aspects of the prudential framework, relating to capital and liquidity risk as well as to banks’ liquidity risk management practices; (ii) transparency, including full disclosure of banks’ exposures on structured products and off-balance sheet vehicles; (iii) valuation standards, especially as regards marking-to-market illiquid assets; (iv) market functioning, including possible conflicts of interest of credit rating agencies and their role in rating structured finance instruments; and (v) authorities’ responsiveness to risks and arrangements for crisis management.At the present juncture, the key priority is to ensure the expeditious and effective implementation of the respective recommendations set out in the FSF report. There is a strong consensus among the international community to act with determination in this regard. In addition, it is fortunate that many of the recommendations were developed by the authorities that now have the mandate to apply them. Nevertheless, the competent national, regional and international authorities and bodies will need to make every possible effort to ensure adequate progress. This relates especially to those actions which were agreed to be implemented within 100 days or by the end of this year. In addition, it will be crucial to continuously monitor the progress made in order to keep up the momentum for reform and, possibly, to identify elements that may require further follow-up action. The FSF will play an instrumental role in monitoring the efficacy of the implementation of its recommendations.I would like to point out that some of the financial system weaknesses exhibited during the recent financial market correction present more structural, longer-term challenges and will require our continued attention in the coming years. Let me draw your attention to four important issues in this regard. First , it will be crucial to ensure adequate transparency regarding financial markets, institutions and financial instruments. The availability of adequate information is the basic prerequisite for sound investment decisions, effective risk management and market discipline. In this way, transparency not only contributes to a more efficient allocation of capital, but is also the best insurance against irrational herd behaviour and the propagation of financial turbulence. Various episodes of financial stress, including the most recent one, have clearly demonstrated that the lack of reliable financial information is a key element in the excessive building up and unwinding of financial imbalances. The continuous enhancement of financial disclosure requirements, accounting rules and valuation practices in line with market developments will therefore be indispensable. Second , pro-cyclical features of the regulatory framework need to be identified and addressed. While to some extent procyclicality is inherent in the financial system because risk is by its own nature cyclical, it is important to ensure that the regulatory framework does not amplify these fluctuations. Instead, the public sector should play an active role in mitigating procyclical behaviour as far as possible by enhancing the forward-looking nature of the regulatory framework. Concrete areas for attention that have been identified include certain elements of the fair value accounting rules and the implementation of the new capital requirements for banks and insurance companies. In the future, public authorities will need to be continuously aware of the importance of applying sufficiently long-term horizons for financial rules and prudential practices.  Third , it will be necessary to pay closer attention to the growing importance and complexity of liquidity risk in the more market-based financial system. In this context it will be essential to ensure that prudent liquidity risk management of financial institutions provides an effective line of defence, also to pre-empt the moral hazard risk associated with a possible undue reliance of market participants on central bank actions. The experience gained from the financial market correction has indicated that the liquidity risk management of a number of financial institutions was not commensurate with their increasing exposure to liquidity risk from both the assets and liabilities side. To ensure progress towards best practices in this field as well as to respond to the increasing need for the effective cross-border mobilisation of liquidity, closer coherence of supervisory requirements and approaches with respect to liquidity risk is also warranted. The recently published consultation paper by the Basel Committee on “Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management and Supervision” constitutes an important starting point in that direction. Finally , the institutional arrangements for cross-border cooperation among authorities should be further enhanced, both during situations of financial distress and in normal times. As regards crisis management arrangements, one priority in my view will be to clarify responsibilities and procedures to support timely and well-targeted public sector action. The recently agreed EU-wide Memorandum of Understanding between supervisory authorities, central banks and finance ministries on cooperation in cross-border financial crisis situations could also serve as a basis for improvements at the international level. With regard to ongoing supervision, I fully support the FSF’s proposal to set up colleges of supervisory authorities for the largest globally active institutions by the end of this year. In the EU, such informal institutional infrastructures of supervisors to support greater information-sharing and coordination in the supervision of cross-border groups are already in place. Our experience in Europe points to a number of elements that are crucial for ensuring the effective functioning of supervisory colleges, which may also be relevant for further developing the international arrangements in this field. These include especially the adequate involvement of all relevant host authorities; a coordinating role for the home country supervisor, with due respect to the responsibilities of host authorities; and arrangements – to be devised by the EU committees of supervisors established under the Lamfalussy approach – to foster consistent procedures and policies across different supervisory colleges. Lastly, closer ongoing cooperation should be pursued not only between supervisors, but also between supervisors and central banks. Such joint work, to be pursued at all levels (nationally, regionally and globally), would in particular aim to enhance the integration of supervisors’ micro-prudential functions and central banks’ macro-prudential functions in the assessment of possible financial risks and vulnerabilities. This would make a significant contribution to raising awareness of emerging financial system imbalances at an earlier stage and devising effectively coordinated public sector action to address them. Furthermore, given the growing role of correspondent and custodian banks in payment and settlement systems, closer cooperation between supervisors and central banks, in their role as overseers, is increasingly important to ensure a comprehensive and consistent treatment of the respective financial risks. Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude my remarks. The establishment of a European capital market safe, efficient and fully integrated is an essential contribution that Europe can make in the context of a harmonious process of financial globalization. Significant progress has already been made in this area, but further progress must be made. It is important that the public sector should support the process of financial integration, notably through improving the regulatory and supervisory structure within the EU, removing obstacles in the field of clearing and settlement systems delivery of securities and strengthening the regulatory framework and market infrastructure for retail banking.Europe must also be heavily involved in safeguarding the resilience of the global financial system, in the process of full integration. Global cooperation deal with the correction seen recently on the capital markets has been effective so far, but we must yield to any overconfidence. Many challenges are indeed still ahead of us. The implementation in a timely and consistent manner the recommendations made by the Forum of financial stability will demand sustained efforts from all of us, to the extent of our responsibilities. Similarly, a constant commitment to close border cooperation remains essential, not only to overcome the current turmoil but, more generally, to ensure satisfactory global financial stability in the context of an international financial system increasingly integrated and complex. Strengthening transparency, mitigating procyclicality of the financial system, effective management of liquidity risk and strengthening institutional arrangements for cooperation between the various authorities responsible are the main routes of the necessary reforms.Thank you for your attention.

d’intervenir aujourd’hui à l’occasion du Forum financier de Paris Europlace. En premier lieu, permettez-moi de préciser que mon discours intervient durant la « purdah period » précédant une réunion du Conseil des gouverneurs. En conséquence, aucun de mes propos ne saurait être interprété en termes d’intentions du Conseil des gouverneurs sur l’orientation de la politique monétaire et le niveau des taux directeurs. Je me concentrerai aujourd’hui sur le rôle de l’Europe dans les marchés financiers globalisés. Il est en effet particulièrement opportun de procéder à une évaluation de la contribution, au sein de l’économie mondiale, des marchés de capitaux européens. Les événements observés sur les marchés de capitaux depuis plusieurs mois nous ont rappelé à quel point le système financier mondial était devenu étroitement intégré. La mondialisation financière est un facteur important du dynamisme économique mondial et de la stabilité, car elle favorise une allocation efficace du capital et accroît les possibilités de partage et de diversification des risques. Il convient toutefois que son développement se déroule dans un environnement caractérisé par l’efficacité et la discipline. Pour cela, il nous appartient à tous d’assumer notre part de responsabilité pour garantir un fonctionnement sûr et efficace du système financier mondial. </p><p>Europe is one of the major building blocks of the global economy and, as such, needs to play a very active role in fostering sound financial globalisation. I would like to highlight two main priorities in this respect. </p><p> </p><p>First</p><p> </p><p>, we should further step up our efforts to build a truly integrated, safe and highly competitive European financial market</p><p>. The tenth anniversary of the ECB one month ago gave us the occasion to take stock of the achievements in European financial integration over the past decade. We were proud to find that significant progress has been achieved and that the introduction of the single currency has acted as a major driving force in this regard. However, as I would like to underline today, further efforts are necessary to make the single financial market a reality. </p><p>While financial integration is first and foremost a market-driven process, authorities can play an important supportive role in a number of ways, for instance by acting as catalysts for private sector initiatives and by reducing policy-related obstacles to cross-border finance. The Eurosystem can also provide central banking services that support the financial integration process. I will highlight a few areas, which, in my view, particularly merit further public sector action. </p><p> </p><p>Second</p><p> </p><p>, Europe should also contribute actively to safeguarding the resilience of the global financial system</p><p>. At the present juncture, the main priority in this regard is to address, from a systemic point of view, the global financial system weaknesses which have been identified during the ongoing financial market correction. At the same time, greater global interconnectedness will continue to necessitate substantial efforts towards enhanced international cooperation. I will mention a number of priority issues in this context.</p><p>Let me begin with a brief review of the current state of European financial integration. Completing the single financial market is a key priority on the European economic agenda for a number of reasons. First, an integrated financial market is a prerequisite for realising the full economic potential of Europe, as highlighted in the Lisbon strategy. A study by London Economics estimates that the integration of the European bond and equity markets could result in additional GDP growth of around 1% over a ten-year period, or approximately 100 billion euro. </p><p>[</p><p>1</p><p>]</p><p> Second, financial integration is also a crucial element in the safe and efficient functioning of the monetary union. In particular, financial markets that are more integrated provide strong support for the effective transmission of the single monetary policy and the smooth operation of the underlying payment systems. By enhancing the depth and liquidity of financial markets, integration also enhances the resilience of the European financial system. </p><p>The ECB has, therefore, always been a strong supporter of the European financial integration process and we have monitored the respective developments very closely. Based on a set of quantitative indicators, we review the state of financial integration in the money, bond, equity and banking markets in our annual report on Financial Integration in Europe. The second issue of this report was published last April. </p><p>[</p><p>2</p><p>]</p><p>Our findings show that European financial integration has advanced significantly since the introduction of the single currency. However, the progress made differs across financial market segments. In particular, integration is more advanced in those segments that are closer to the single monetary policy and it also depends on the integration of the underlying market infrastructures. </p><p>The euro area unsecured </p><p>money markets</p><p> score well in both of these respects. It is therefore not surprising that these markets reached a stage of near-perfect integration almost immediately after the introduction of the euro, when the cross-country standard deviation of the unsecured interbank lending rates rapidly decreased to an almost negligible level of two to three basis points. The collateralised money markets are also well integrated. Although there was a slight increase in the standard deviation of unsecured rates during the financial market correction, the fact that collateralised rates have not reacted in a similar way suggests that the reason lies in an increased variability of credit risk among banks rather than in growing cross-border market segmentation.</p><p>The close integration of large-value payment systems has been instrumental in achieving and sustaining money market integration. TARGET, the Eurosystem’s real-time gross settlement facility for euro payments, became operational in January 1999 and since then has enabled the safe and efficient euro-area wide handling of interbank payment transactions. The move to a single shared platform with TARGET2, which on 19 May 2008 fully replaced the former TARGET system, will render wholesale euro payments even more integrated and efficient. </p><p> </p><p>Bond and equity markets</p><p> also show clear signs of integration, especially the government bond markets. Progress has also been achieved in the corporate bond markets and, to a lesser extent, in equity markets. Both bond yields and equity returns are increasingly driven by common factors and the cross-border shares of bond and equity holdings have been growing to 60% and one third of total holdings, respectively. This suggests that euro area investors are progressively diversifying their portfolios on a cross-border basis. At the same time, country-specific factors still play an important role, especially in corporate bond and equity markets. A key obstacle to greater bond and equity market integration is the lack of a sufficiently integrated infrastructure for securities clearing and settlement in the EU.</p><p>Substantial progress has also been made on the integration of </p><p>banking markets</p><p>, namely in the wholesale and capital market-related segments. Cross-border interbank loans have increased to almost a quarter of total interbank loans and euro area banks’ holdings of securities issued by banks in other euro area countries have almost tripled over the past decade. By contrast, retail banking markets have remained fragmented so far. For instance, the cross-border share of loans to non-banks has more or less stagnated at a very low level, below 5%. Similarly, the cross-country dispersion of banks’ interest rates on loans to non-financial corporations and households has remained relatively high, especially with regard to consumer loans. </p><p>Further efforts are needed to complete the single financial market, particularly in those areas where integration is currently lagging behind, namely in the corporate bond, equity and retail banking markets. While I would like to highlight again the primary role of market-led action in this respect, public authorities should nevertheless strive to facilitate progress. I see three main priorities at the current juncture, namely to: (i) further enhance the EU institutional setting for financial regulation and supervision; (ii) remove obstacles to cross-border securities clearing and settlement; and (iii) enhance the EU regulatory framework and market infrastructure for retail banking.</p><p>The European financial integration process presents a twin challenge for the </p><p>EU regulatory and supervisory architecture</p><p>. </p><p>First</p><p>, closer convergence of prudential rules and supervisory practices is needed in order to facilitate the efficient operation of cross-border financial institutions and to safeguard an effective pan-European level playing field. </p><p>Second</p><p>, while financial integration increases the overall shock-absorbing capacity of the financial system it also increases the likelihood that financial risks may be cross-border in origin or nature. Against this background closer cross-border cooperation in monitoring and addressing financial risks is of the essence. </p><p>The EU has already taken important steps to foster regulatory and supervisory convergence and cooperation in recent years. The introduction of an enhanced institutional setting for financial regulation and supervision with the Lamfalussy framework has been a milestone in this respect, coupled with improvements to the EU legislative framework for financial services, including in particular the adoption of the Financial Services Action Plan and the respective follow-up policy for the period 2005-2010. </p><p>However, the first full review of the Lamfalussy framework by ECOFIN in December 2007 demonstrated that the new institutional setting has not yet reached its full potential. While the review confirmed the widely shared assessment that the Lamfalussy framework has greatly enhanced the EU regulatory and supervisory process in recent years, it also underlined that the optimal level of cross-border convergence and cooperation has not yet been attained. </p><p>In order to move forward, the December 2007 ECOFIN pointed to the need to: (i) strengthen the roles, tools and decision-making procedures of the EU committees of supervisors; (ii) enhance the supervisory arrangements for cross-border financial groups by improving the functioning of the supervisory colleges formed by the competent home and host supervisors; and (iii) consider introducing a reference to the EU in the mandates of national supervisors. The ECOFIN Council set out a specific roadmap for achieving progress on these issues by the end of 2008. </p><p>The Eurosystem strongly supports these initiatives. Indeed, from the inception of the Lamfalussy framework we have argued that this innovative institutional approach provides an appropriate basis for achieving the heightened degree of cross-border convergence and cooperation which is required. One of the key advantages of the Lamfalussy approach is the combination of a decentralised set-up with cross-border coordination at EU level. A decentralised approach is in line with the national responsibilities for safeguarding financial stability – relating not only to financial regulation and supervision, but also to financial stability monitoring and assessment, crisis management, and deposit insurance – while also allowing for the benefits of geographical proximity and the established experience and knowledge of local authorities to be drawn upon. At the same time, it is clear that the accompanying coordinating mechanisms need to be sufficiently strong, and this has not been the case so far. Therefore, a key priority on the EU financial services policy agenda is the effective and timely implementation of the measures that will allow the full benefits of the Lamfalussy framework to be reaped.</p><p>Let me now turn to the work underway on </p><p>enhancing securities clearing and settlement</p><p> that is underway in Europe </p><p> Given the existing fragmentation of the securities market infrastructure the post-trading costs of cross-border securities transactions in the EU are excessively high and this constitutes an important impediment to the enhanced integration of European bond and equity markets. A number of initiatives have been launched to achieve progress in this field, relating in particular to the implementation of the industry’s Code of Conduct and the removal of the so-called Giovannini barriers. A crucial complementary step towards an integrated European securities market infrastructure would be to establish a common securities settlement platform. This is the objective of the Eurosystem’s TARGET2-Securities (T2S) initiative. </p><p>Under T2S, cross-border transactions will be settled at the same price and as efficiently as domestic transactions. Moreover, the T2S settlement cost will be significantly lower even than the cost today of domestic transactions. If T2S existed now, the average settlement cost could be reduced very substantially. If the geographical scope of T2S were extended beyond the euro area, substantial further cost savings would be achieved. In addition to the pure settlement cost, banks and other users would also enjoy substantial back office and collateral savings. </p><p>The details of the economic impact analysis of T2S are set out in the proposal by the ECB’s Governing Council’s proposal for all European central securities depositories to join the T2S project. This proposal also includes the user requirements that have been developed in close co-operation with hundreds of experts from central securities depositories (CSDs), banks and central banks. The entire documentation, which was sent to the CSDs on 23 May 2008, is available on the ECB’s website. The Governing Council has invited all European CSDs to express their views with regard to their participation in T2S by 4 July 2008 and will subsequently decide whether to proceed with the project.</p><p>While the Code of Conduct, the removal of the Giovannini barriers and T2S are different lines of work, they all aim at enhancing the efficiency of post-trading services in Europe. They are complemented by the ESCB-CESR recommendations, which aim to ensure the safety and soundness of EU post-trading activities.</p><p>Finally, I would like to make a few remarks on further steps to </p><p>promote retail banking integration</p><p>. Again, a multi-pronged approach is most promising in this regard. For instance, the European Commission, as part of its financial services policy for the years 2005-2010, is pursuing a number of initiatives to overcome both regulatory and market-based barriers in this field. In addition, it is expected that the above mentioned initiatives to streamline the regulatory and supervisory interface for cross-border financial institutions will foster an enhanced cross-border provision of banking services, including in the retail segment. </p><p>Furthermore, in January 2008 the market-led initiative to establish a Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) was launched, which aims at achieving a fully integrated market for retail payment services in the euro area via harmonised technical standards and market practices, with no distinction between cross-border and national payments. The main priority at the current juncture is for all stakeholders to make every possible effort to achieve the full and timely implementation of SEPA in order to ensure that a critical mass of retail payments will be made on the basis of SEPA instruments by end 2010. </p><p>As ECOFIN concluded in January this year, public authorities have an important catalytic function in driving the migration process to SEPA forward, namely by supporting and explaining SEPA in their communication with their national constituencies. In addition to this political task, they also have an operational role to play in becoming early users of SEPA products and services. As initiators and receivers of high volumes of payment transactions, public authorities – such as national and local administrations, tax authorities, social security agencies and pension funds – are key stakeholders which can make SEPA a success. </p><p>We have noted that there is still a lack of information and awareness about SEPA among the public at large. Greater effort should be made to communicate the benefits of SEPA to corporate enterprises and private customers at European and national levels. </p><p>While we expect that the critical mass of retail payments will have moved to SEPA payments by the end of 2010 on a voluntary basis, an official end-date for the migration period may need to be set, by which time the use of national credit transfers and direct debits should have been phased out. Recent studies by the ECB and the European Commission have clearly shown that a lengthy period of processing the old national and the new SEPA instruments in parallel will be costly for both banks and their customers. Therefore, this period of dual processing should be kept as short as possible. </p><p>Financial integration is proceeding not only within Europe, but also at the global level. Financial globalisation enables the international community to share significant benefits in terms of enhanced financial efficiency and economic growth, but it also makes the safeguarding of financial stability a more interdependent endeavour. Effectively coordinated international action aimed at addressing financial system vulnerabilities has therefore become very important, as highlighted during the ongoing financial market correction.</p><p>Against this background, the major collective effort undertaken by both the public and the private sector to cope with the financial market turbulences has been encouraging. Hard work has been done in terms of restoring the orderly functioning of financial markets in the short term and identifying proper measures to strengthen the resilience of the financial system in the longer term in order to avoid the recurrence of similar events in the future. The report of the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) on “Enhancing Market and Institutional Resilience” </p><p>[</p><p>3</p><p>]</p><p> has been fully endorsed by the international community and provides the main reference point for the necessary improvements. In this context, let me briefly point out that enhancements will be required in a number of areas, with particular focus on (i) aspects of the prudential framework, relating to capital and liquidity risk as well as to banks’ liquidity risk management practices; (ii) transparency, including full disclosure of banks’ exposures on structured products and off-balance sheet vehicles; (iii) valuation standards, especially as regards marking-to-market illiquid assets; (iv) market functioning, including possible conflicts of interest of credit rating agencies and their role in rating structured finance instruments; and (v) authorities’ responsiveness to risks and arrangements for crisis management.</p><p>At the present juncture, the key priority is to ensure the expeditious and effective implementation of the respective recommendations set out in the FSF report. There is a strong consensus among the international community to act with determination in this regard. In addition, it is fortunate that many of the recommendations were developed by the authorities that now have the mandate to apply them. Nevertheless, the competent national, regional and international authorities and bodies will need to make every possible effort to ensure adequate progress. This relates especially to those actions which were agreed to be implemented within 100 days or by the end of this year. In addition, it will be crucial to continuously monitor the progress made in order to keep up the momentum for reform and, possibly, to identify elements that may require further follow-up action. The FSF will play an instrumental role in monitoring the efficacy of the implementation of its recommendations.</p><p>I would like to point out that some of the financial system weaknesses exhibited during the recent financial market correction present more structural, longer-term challenges and will require our continued attention in the coming years. Let me draw your attention to four important issues in this regard.</p><p> </p><p>First</p><p> </p><p>, it will be crucial to ensure adequate transparency regarding financial markets, institutions and financial instruments</p><p>. The availability of adequate information is the basic prerequisite for sound investment decisions, effective risk management and market discipline. In this way, transparency not only contributes to a more efficient allocation of capital, but is also the best insurance against irrational herd behaviour and the propagation of financial turbulence. Various episodes of financial stress, including the most recent one, have clearly demonstrated that the lack of reliable financial information is a key element in the excessive building up and unwinding of financial imbalances. The continuous enhancement of financial disclosure requirements, accounting rules and valuation practices in line with market developments will therefore be indispensable.</p><p> </p><p>Second</p><p> </p><p>, pro-cyclical features of the regulatory framework need to be identified and addressed</p><p>. While to some extent procyclicality is inherent in the financial system because risk is by its own nature cyclical, it is important to ensure that the regulatory framework does not amplify these fluctuations. Instead, the public sector should play an active role in mitigating procyclical behaviour as far as possible by enhancing the forward-looking nature of the regulatory framework. Concrete areas for attention that have been identified include certain elements of the fair value accounting rules and the implementation of the new capital requirements for banks and insurance companies. In the future, public authorities will need to be continuously aware of the importance of applying sufficiently long-term horizons for financial rules and prudential practices. </p><p> </p><p>Third</p><p> </p><p>, it will be necessary to pay closer attention to the growing importance and complexity of liquidity risk in the more market-based financial system. </p><p>In this context it will be essential to ensure that prudent liquidity risk management of financial institutions provides an effective line of defence, also to pre-empt the moral hazard risk associated with a possible undue reliance of market participants on central bank actions. The experience gained from the financial market correction has indicated that the liquidity risk management of a number of financial institutions was not commensurate with their increasing exposure to liquidity risk from both the assets and liabilities side. To ensure progress towards best practices in this field as well as to respond to the increasing need for the effective cross-border mobilisation of liquidity, closer coherence of supervisory requirements and approaches with respect to liquidity risk is also warranted. The recently published consultation paper by the Basel Committee on “Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management and Supervision” constitutes an important starting point in that direction.</p><p> </p><p>Finally</p><p> </p><p>, the institutional arrangements for cross-border cooperation among authorities should be further enhanced,</p><p> both during situations of financial distress and in normal times. As regards crisis management arrangements, one priority in my view will be to clarify responsibilities and procedures to support timely and well-targeted public sector action. The recently agreed EU-wide Memorandum of Understanding between supervisory authorities, central banks and finance ministries on cooperation in cross-border financial crisis situations could also serve as a basis for improvements at the international level. </p><p>With regard to ongoing supervision, I fully support the FSF’s proposal to set up colleges of supervisory authorities for the largest globally active institutions by the end of this year. In the EU, such informal institutional infrastructures of supervisors to support greater information-sharing and coordination in the supervision of cross-border groups are already in place. Our experience in Europe points to a number of elements that are crucial for ensuring the effective functioning of supervisory colleges, which may also be relevant for further developing the international arrangements in this field. These include especially the adequate involvement of all relevant host authorities; a coordinating role for the home country supervisor, with due respect to the responsibilities of host authorities; and arrangements – to be devised by the EU committees of supervisors established under the Lamfalussy approach – to foster consistent procedures and policies across different supervisory colleges. </p><p>Lastly, closer ongoing cooperation should be pursued not only between supervisors, but also between supervisors and central banks. Such joint work, to be pursued at all levels (nationally, regionally and globally), would in particular aim to enhance the integration of supervisors’ micro-prudential functions and central banks’ macro-prudential functions in the assessment of possible financial risks and vulnerabilities. This would make a significant contribution to raising awareness of emerging financial system imbalances at an earlier stage and devising effectively coordinated public sector action to address them. Furthermore, given the growing role of correspondent and custodian banks in payment and settlement systems, closer cooperation between supervisors and central banks, in their role as overseers, is increasingly important to ensure a comprehensive and consistent treatment of the respective financial risks. </p><p>Mesdames et Messieurs, permettez-moi de conclure mon intervention. La mise en place d’un marché des capitaux européen sûr, efficient et totalement intégré est une contribution essentielle que l’Europe peut apporter dans le cadre d’un processus harmonieux de mondialisation financière. Des progrès significatifs ont déjà été réalisés dans ce domaine, mais de nouvelles avancées doivent être réalisées. Il importe que le secteur public soutienne le processus d’intégration financière, notamment à travers l’amélioration de la structure réglementaire et de surveillance au sein de l’Union européenne, la levée des obstacles dans le domaine des systèmes de compensation et de règlement-livraison de titres et le renforcement du cadre réglementaire et de l’infrastructure de marché pour les services bancaires aux particuliers. </p><p>L’Europe doit aussi s’impliquer fortement dans la sauvegarde de la résilience du système financier mondial, en voie d’intégration complète. La coopération mondiale face à la correction observée récemment sur les marchés de capitaux a été efficace jusqu’à présent, mais il ne faut céder à aucun excès de confiance. De nombreux défis sont en effet encore devant nous. La mise en œuvre en temps opportun et de façon cohérente des recommandations formulées par le Forum de la stabilité financière réclamera des efforts soutenus de la part de chacun d’entre nous, à la mesure de nos responsabilités. De même, un engagement constant en faveur d’une étroite coopération transfrontière demeurera essentiel, non seulement pour surmonter les turbulences actuelles mais, plus généralement, pour assurer une stabilité financière mondiale satisfaisante dans le contexte d’un système financier international de plus en plus intégré et complexe. Le renforcement de la transparence, l’atténuation de la procyclicité du système financier, une gestion efficace des risques de liquidité et la consolidation des dispositifs institutionnels de coopération entre les différentes autorités responsables constituent les grands axes des réformes nécessaires.</p><p>Je vous remercie de votre attention.

Jean-Claude Trichet: A unique perspective,15-04-2008,European Central Bank,ECB,1037,"Ladies and gentlemen,it is my great pleasure to speak today on the publication of Professor Otmar Issing's book on the euro to you. The merger of now 15 EU member states in the European economic and monetary union, with the euro as the common currency for 320 million European citizens, is one of the greatest successes of monetary history. Otmar had as Board Member of the ECB in the first eight years of its existence and as board member of the Bundesbank in the previous eight years been instrumental in the successful launch and establishment of the Euro. His book thus offers a unique perspective on the success story of our common European currency.Why has the creation of the euro been a success story? Of paramount importance is the fact that, right from the beginning, the ECB was able to establish, and then maintain, a high level of credibility to effectively safeguard price stability in the euro area. During the transition to the euro, market interest rates on instruments denominated in euro became aligned all along the yield curve with the lowest – and not with the average – rates prevailing in the euro area prior to the euro. This demonstrated that the ECB had managed to inherit the high level of credibility that had been achieved by the most successful national central banks joining the monetary union, in particular the Deutsche Bundesbank. You know how proud I was myself to have run a monetary policy that had given my own national currency the same level of credibility as the DM before the euro. The ECB has fully maintained this achievement during the now more than nine years since the start of EMU. Despite a large number of unprecedented adverse macroeconomic and geopolitical shocks during this period, inflation expectations have been firmly anchored, which testifies to the success of the ECB’s stability-orientated monetary policy, and vindicates the public’s initial confidence in the stability of the euro. The high credibility and success of the single monetary policy in the euro area rests on two cornerstones: the institutional framework of the ECB enshrined in the Treaty establishing the European Community, and the ECB’s stability-orientated monetary policy strategy. The constituent features of the ECB’s institutional architecture are a clear mandate to safeguard price stability in the euro area, and full independence in the pursuit of this mandate. These institutional provisions reflect the key insights gained by academic research and policy experience over the past decades that price stability is a necessary condition for sustainable growth and job creation and that monetary policy decisions are best placed in the hands of an independent central bank. Central bank independence is key for monetary policy to be credibly and effectively geared to price stability. The credibility of the single monetary policy, and the continued success of the euro, are therefore fully based upon the ECB’s independence, guaranteed by the Treaty.The ECB’s monetary policy strategy, which comprises a quantitative definition of price stability and a two-pillar framework involving economic and monetary analysis for the assessment of the risks to price stability, provides a comprehensive and consistent framework for conducting our monetary policy, and for communicating with the public. Our strategy ensures that we take all information relevant to price stability in the euro area duly into account and pursue our mandate in a steady and forward-looking manner, thereby helping us to take sound and timely policy decisions. In being fully transparent about the ultimate goal of our monetary policy and how we go about achieving it, our monetary policy strategy also makes an important contribution to the credibility and predictability of our policy. This ultimately facilitates the fulfilment of our mandate, as it enhances our ability to guide price and wage setters and financial markets in a way that is consistent with our price stability objective.The beneficial effects of the euro are reflected in the much-improved performance of the euro area economies over the last nine years. I have already mentioned the stabilisation of inflation expectations in the euro area at unprecedentedly low levels, in line with our definition of price stability. A particularly noteworthy development is the marked improvement in the performance of the euro area labour markets. Since the start of EMU, 15.7 million new jobs have been created in the euro area during the first nine years, in comparison to approximately five million in the nine preceding years. At the same time, the euro area unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since the early 1980s. However, these quite remarkable developments should not give rise to complacency. The euro area could and should do much better, particularly as regards the level of productivity growth. Monetary policy can make an important contribution to economic performance by maintaining price stability, and thereby eliminating distortions arising from high and volatile inflation. Yet, the development of growth and employment are ultimately determined by the structural features of an economy. More determined, well-designed structural reforms promoting flexibility in euro area product and labour markets are, therefore, crucial in order to fully reap the benefits and support the continued success of the euro.Otmar Issing has contributed to the euro’s success in many important ways. When he was a Board member at the Bundesbank he was one of the most fervent advocates of the absolute necessity of sustainable convergence as a precondition for EMU, in order to ensure that the new currency would be at least as credible as the most credible currencies joining the monetary union. As a member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Otmar played a crucial role in designing the ECB’s monetary policy strategy and in the successful conduct of the single monetary policy in the uncharted territory of the early years of EMU.

Der Zusammenschluss von jetzt 15 EU-Mitgliedstaaten in der Europäischen Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion, mit dem Euro als der gemeinsamen Währung für rund 320 Millionen europäische Bürgerinnen und Bürger, ist einer der größten Erfolge der Währungsgeschichte. Otmar hatte als Direktoriumsmitglied der EZB in den ersten acht Jahren ihres Bestehens und als Direktoriumsmitglied der Bundesbank in den acht Jahren davor maßgeblichen Anteil an der erfolgreichen Einführung und Etablierung des Euro. Sein Buch bietet damit eine einzigartige Perspektive auf die Erfolgsgeschichte unserer gemeinsamen europäischen Währung.</p><p>Why has the creation of the euro been a success story? Of paramount importance is the fact that, right from the beginning, the ECB was able to establish, and then maintain, a high level of credibility to effectively safeguard price stability in the euro area. During the transition to the euro, market interest rates on instruments denominated in euro became aligned all along the yield curve with the lowest – and not with the average – rates prevailing in the euro area prior to the euro. This demonstrated that the ECB had managed to inherit the high level of credibility that had been achieved by the most successful national central banks joining the monetary union, in particular the Deutsche Bundesbank. You know how proud I was myself to have run a monetary policy that had given my own national currency the same level of credibility as the DM before the euro. The ECB has fully maintained this achievement during the now more than nine years since the start of EMU. Despite a large number of unprecedented adverse macroeconomic and geopolitical shocks during this period, inflation expectations have been firmly anchored, which testifies to the success of the ECB’s stability-orientated monetary policy, and vindicates the public’s initial confidence in the stability of the euro. </p><p>The high credibility and success of the single monetary policy in the euro area rests on two cornerstones: the institutional framework of the ECB enshrined in the Treaty establishing the European Community, and the ECB’s stability-orientated monetary policy strategy. The constituent features of the ECB’s institutional architecture are a clear mandate to safeguard price stability in the euro area, and full independence in the pursuit of this mandate. These institutional provisions reflect the key insights gained by academic research and policy experience over the past decades that price stability is a necessary condition for sustainable growth and job creation and that monetary policy decisions are best placed in the hands of an independent central bank. Central bank independence is key for monetary policy to be credibly and effectively geared to price stability. The credibility of the single monetary policy, and the continued success of the euro, are therefore fully based upon the ECB’s independence, guaranteed by the Treaty.</p><p>The ECB’s monetary policy strategy, which comprises a quantitative definition of price stability and a two-pillar framework involving economic and monetary analysis for the assessment of the risks to price stability, provides a comprehensive and consistent framework for conducting our monetary policy, and for communicating with the public. Our strategy ensures that we take all information relevant to price stability in the euro area duly into account and pursue our mandate in a steady and forward-looking manner, thereby helping us to take sound and timely policy decisions. In being fully transparent about the ultimate goal of our monetary policy and how we go about achieving it, our monetary policy strategy also makes an important contribution to the credibility and predictability of our policy. This ultimately facilitates the fulfilment of our mandate, as it enhances our ability to guide price and wage setters and financial markets in a way that is consistent with our price stability objective.</p><p>The beneficial effects of the euro are reflected in the much-improved performance of the euro area economies over the last nine years. I have already mentioned the stabilisation of inflation expectations in the euro area at unprecedentedly low levels, in line with our definition of price stability. A particularly noteworthy development is the marked improvement in the performance of the euro area labour markets. Since the start of EMU, 15.7 million new jobs have been created in the euro area during the first nine years, in comparison to approximately five million in the nine preceding years. At the same time, the euro area unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since the early 1980s. </p><p>However, these quite remarkable developments should not give rise to complacency. The euro area could and should do much better, particularly as regards the level of productivity growth. Monetary policy can make an important contribution to economic performance by maintaining price stability, and thereby eliminating distortions arising from high and volatile inflation. Yet, the development of growth and employment are ultimately determined by the structural features of an economy. More determined, well-designed structural reforms promoting flexibility in euro area product and labour markets are, therefore, crucial in order to fully reap the benefits and support the continued success of the euro.</p><p>Otmar Issing has contributed to the euro’s success in many important ways. When he was a Board member at the Bundesbank he was one of the most fervent advocates of the absolute necessity of sustainable convergence as a precondition for EMU, in order to ensure that the new currency would be at least as credible as the most credible currencies joining the monetary union. As a member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Otmar played a crucial role in designing the ECB’s monetary policy strategy and in the successful conduct of the single monetary policy in the uncharted territory of the early years of EMU. He has been the living symbol of the continuity between the most credible national currencies and the euro. His outstanding career as a central figure in European monetary policy in times that were decisive for EMU makes Otmar Issing’s book on the euro indeed a remarkable book written from the unique perspective of a unique actor and a unique witness of this historical endeavour.</p><p>Reproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.</p><p> </p><p>Media contacts</p><p> </p>",entr
Jean-Claude Trichet: Remarks on the occasion of the European Banker of the Year Award,17-11-2009,European Central Bank,ECB,1423,"Mr Prime Minister,Ladies and Gentlemen,I am very pleased to be here again this year and to be paying tribute to Jean-Claude Juncker, Prime Minister of Luxembourg and President of the Eurogroup. As regards the “European Banker of the Year” award, I warmly congratulate both Jean-Claude Juncker and the jury for this decision. My main aim for today is to say how honouring Jean-Claude Juncker is a very good choice for many reasons. I have known Prime Minister Juncker for many, many years and we have cooperated ever more closely: first in the general European context; then through my association with the Eurogroup; and finally in the current crisis, where governments and central banks have stood shoulder to shoulder. Let me briefly review Mr Juncker’s career and achievements. Born in the western part of Luxemburg, Mr Juncker studied law and earned his degree at Strasbourg University in 1979. A brilliant and dazzling rise followed: Mr Juncker became member of the government at the age of 28, first as Secretary of State and afterwards Minister for Labour. He was appointed Finance Minister at 35 and Prime Minister at 41. Throughout his career, Mr Juncker has been committed to Europe and participated in the birth of the Euro, being one of the major architects of the Maastricht Treaty. His European convictions came to the fore in 2005, when he submitted the Constitutional Treaty to referendum, putting his own premiership on the line. With Luxembourg nestled between two large countries, Mr Juncker is a very visible representative of his country in the international arena. At the same time, he is widely appreciated as a very efficient behind-the-scenes negotiator on European issues, not least because he can see them from both the German and the French perspective. He once said – I quote here from the laudatory statement on the occasion of Mr Juncker being awarded the Charlemagne Prize in 2006 – that “ institutional life in Europe is a bit like life in the animal kingdom – a flea can drive a lion crazy, but there is no known example of a lion driving a flea crazy. That shows how important it is to find the right balance between great and small.” This quote illustrates his strong belief in his country’s strategic role as a mediator alongside the larger European countries.Beyond that, Jean-Claude Juncker is currently the longest serving prime minister in the EU. This testifies to his leadership and the trust that he inspires in people. He also appears to be immune to what academic literature has come to label “Juncker’s say”. On the need for structural reforms, he once remarked that “ we politicians know what to do, but what we do not know is how to get re-elected”. Dear Jean-Claude, I imagine that many of your fellow heads of government look to you from time to time for guidance on how you have managed to succeed.Praise for Mr Juncker must also pay tribute to his leadership skills – as President of the Eurogroup – during the current financial and economic crisis. Since 2005, Mr Juncker serves as the first permanent President of the Eurogroup. Under his leadership, the Eurogroup provided essential input to the concerted action plan adopted by the euro area Heads of State or Government on 12 October 2008, which was a key step in designing a framework for an EU policy response. In this context let me emphasise my appreciation for the full respect Jean-Claude Juncker has for the independence of the European Central Bank, which I qualified some years ago as the “fierce independence” of the central bank. As President of the ECB, I regularly attend, together with the Vice-President, the monthly meetings of the Eurogroup. Mr Juncker attends the meetings of the ECB’s Governing Council. The exchanges of views on these occasions help us, as policy-makers, to understand each others’ policy concerns while fully respecting each other’s responsibilities. I wish to take this opportunity to thank you, Jean-Claude, for the fruitful cooperation that we have enjoyed over the past few years.There is yet another aspect I admire about Mr Juncker, and this is his mastery of language. La maîtrise des langues en Europe est primordiale, car l’enjeu et le grand défi européen c’est la création d’un sentiment collectif européen mais aussi et surtout pouvoir parler le même langage alors que l’on parle des langues différentes. C’est faire en sorte que, concrètement, les messages politiques soient entendus partout de la même manière quand bien même ils seront émis dans des langues différentes. Je me rappelle une pensée du philosophe Edgar Morin qui disait que “le génie européen n’est pas seulement dans la pluralité et dans le changement, il est dans le dialogue des pluralités qui produit le changement” ( Thinking Europe). This is why Jean-Claude Juncker, with his mastery of languages, is well placed to be at the heart of dialogue pluralities that constitute the European universal.Luxembourg is an example of how different languages ​​and cultures living together in harmony in a country stimulate each other and find a common identity. Luxembourgish, which belongs to the German language family but was also strongly influenced by the French, is a good example of this cultural synthesis. In this way, one can as Luxembourg, pars pro toto 'for all of Europe see. Perhaps for this reason Luxembourg was the first city that was twice voted for, the European Capital of Culture '.* * *Given the current environment, I would also like to say a few words on the economic situation and recent developments. As you will recall from the press conference that followed the Governing Council meeting of 5 November 2009, both pillars of our monetary policy strategy indicate that inflationary pressures over the medium term are low. Our assessment is therefore that the current stance of monetary policy, which encompasses both very low interest rates and a series of non-standard measures, remains appropriate. Monetary policy thus continues to support the availability of liquidity in the financial system and the recovery of the euro area economy. Having said this, improved conditions in financial markets imply that not all of our non-standard measures will be needed to the same extent as before.The latest information and analyses are broadly in line with our expectations. While annual HICP inflation was slightly negative in October, it is expected to turn positive again in the coming months, and to remain at moderately positive rates over the policy-relevant horizon. At the same time, the latest information continues to signal an improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year. Although this outlook remains subject to a high degree of uncertainty, we expect the euro area economy to recover at a gradual pace in 2010. The monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit growth has continued to slow down. Against this background, the current rates remain appropriate, and we therefore decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Market expectations for inflation are in line with our assessment. In particular, medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Let me make one remark on exchange rates. I have repeatedly been on record in saying that I appreciate the statements made by the US President, the US Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve that a strong dollar is in the interest of the United States of America. I agree with this analysis entirely. I would add that I believe that the strength of the dollar within the set of floating currencies is in the interest not only of the United States, but of the entire international community. I noted with great interest the remarks made yesterday by Chairman Ben Bernanke at the Economic Club of New York. He said: “The Federal Reserve will continue to monitor these developments closely. We are attentive to the implications of changes in the value of the dollar and will continue to formulate policy to guard against risks to our dual mandate to foster both maximum employment and price stability. Our commitment to our dual objectives, together with the underlying strengths of the US economy, will help ensure that the dollar is strong and a source of global financial stability”. This is a very important statement by my colleague, with whom I have a very good relationship. We are fully aligned in this analysis.

Jean-Claude Trichet: Lessons from the financial crisis,15-10-2009,European Central Bank,ECB,3139,"Dear President wine purchase,Dear Sir or Madam,thank you for your invitation. I am delighted to be here today.The Business Forum with over 2,500 in this hall present entrepreneurs is an important event. He gathered the German Mittelstand, which is rightly called the backbone of the economy. The central role of SMEs is an essential characteristic of the German economy and the European economy. Meanwhile, we are very aware at the European Central Bank. We know that especially the middle class is dependent on the supply of credit by banks, and our actions last year aimed not least on enabling lending to banks during the crisis.The middle class lives a property held that I particularly appreciate: the focus on the long term. An innovative spirit coupled with the patience to wait for the fruits of the investment, is the source of our prosperity. The financial crisis has shown that this long-term vision was not anchored well the same in all sectors and countries.The crisis has - a strong earthquake equal - spread throughout the world and made before any sector halt. The epicenter was far away, but the shock waves were strong enough to reach the people in the euro area. Here and elsewhere, the economic output fell stronger than ever since the 2nd World War.My speech, I would like to dedicate three issues: first, the current credit conditions in the euro area, secondly, the ECB measures to support lending and, thirdly, the international efforts to contain the crisis and to make the financial system more robust. Allow me to please, proceed in English.* * *Let me start with an issue that is sure to be close to your hearts – namely access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises so as to allow them develop their businesses. To gain a deeper understanding of what is going on in this key part of the economy, we recently launched a new survey, in conjunction with the European Commission. In June and July this year, more than 6,000 firms in the euro area were interviewed about what has been happening in their businesses. Perhaps some of you here today took part.The results of the survey paint a picture that I think you will recognise. The firms reported that they were having difficulties in finding customers, that their turnover and profits were falling and that bank loans were harder to come by. The survey also indicates that the crisis has been at least as severe for small and medium sized firms as for larger ones.The results of the survey seem to be in line with our general assessment of credit conditions in the euro area. Most notably, around three out of five small and medium-sized firms that had applied for a bank loan in the first half of 2009 received the requested amount in full. Around one in five received the requested amount in part. And only about one in ten had the loan application rejected. [1]Such results do not point to a severe rationing of credit, although both this survey and surveys of banks indicate that credit standards have been tightened. We are closely monitoring the access to finance of small and medium-sized enterprises. We will also repeat the survey every six months so as to ensure that the business conditions you face are monitored continuously.Let me now first turn to the ECB’s response to the crisis.Emergencies – such as the financial “earthquake” we all experienced last autumn following the collapse of a major bank in the United States – call for swift and forceful action by the responsible authorities. The ECB demonstrated its alertness from the very first day. In fact, when the problems in financial markets first became apparent on 9 August 2007, we were the first central bank to respond, acting within hours.At this point, I think it is useful to remind you of the ECB’s responsibilities. Our primary mandate is the maintenance of price stability over the medium term. This was laid down in the Treaty on European Union, signed by Europe’s leaders in Maastricht back in 1992. The Governing Council aims to keep inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.All our monetary policy decisions during the last eleven years have been aiming at delivering price stability in the medium term.After the intensification of the crisis mid September 2008, as inflationary pressures receded, in full consistency with our mandate, we decided to reduce our policy interest rate rapidly between October 2008 and May 2009. We are currently refinancing banks at 1%, an interest rate level that has not been experienced in the countries of the euro area at any time in recent history.And we have gone beyond the standard monetary policy approach of changing interest rates. We have adopted several “non-standard” measures that I have previously described as our policy of “enhanced credit support”. The measures were designed to ensure that our interest rate reductions were transmitted to the broader economy, despite the problems in the financial sector. In particular, the aim has been to enable banks to continue their lending to households and firms.To this end, we have supplied as much liquidity since October last year as banks have asked for, at fixed rates. We have also expanded the already long list of collateral that we accept in these market operations. And we have provided liquidity for longer periods than we have done in the past.In June this year, we conducted the first one-year operation, providing banks with credit against securities at 1% for one year. We had a record allotment of €442 billion in this operation. In the second such operation, a few weeks ago in late September, we supplied banks with €75 billion, again at an interest rate of 1% for one year.In cooperation with other central banks, we have moreover provided liquidity in foreign currencies, most notably US dollars. This was because euro area banks were experiencing difficulties in obtaining the foreign currency they needed.These measures can all be seen as an expansion of our normal market operations with banks. In addition, since July this year, we have intervened directly in the longer-maturity segments of financial markets by buying covered bonds. The purpose of the purchases has been to reactivate a market that had been an important source of funding for banks.The measures we have implemented have been concentrated on banks. You may ask why we are undertaking such efforts to support banks.In the euro area, banks play a crucial role in maintaining and extending credit to all other sectors of the economy. Indeed, the survey I have just mentioned told us that smaller firms in the euro area are even more dependent on banks for financing than larger firms. So, it has been essential for us to supply liquidity in an appropriate way to the euro area banks. On the whole, we are satisfied with the results of the non-standard measures we have taken. Our decisions on interest rates and liquidity have been transmitted reasonably well to the rest of the economy, despite the crisis. Developments in lending have recently been subdued. In comparison with credit conditions during past downturns, however, the recent developments do not appear to have been unusual. It should not be surprising that firms and households may ask for fewer new loans during an economic downturn. Indeed, recent developments in lending are to a major extent explained by weak demand. However, supply side factors have also played a role. For a sustained recovery in credit to set in, banks will need to repair their balance sheets. On behalf of the Governing Council, I have therefore stressed continuously that banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen their capital bases. Where still necessary, banks should also take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector.One year after the dramatic deepening of the financial crisis in September 2008, we can observe more and more signs of economic stabilisation in the euro area. We have halted the freefall in economic activity that we witnessed around the turn of the year. There are reasons to believe that a gradual recovery lies ahead. But the uncertainty surrounding this outlook remains high.* * *Exceptional times have called for exceptional measures. As the situation normalises, the non-standard measures need to be phased out, and the substantial policy stimulus must be withdrawn.We at the ECB have designed our non-standard measures with an exit strategy in mind. It is still premature to declare the financial crisis to be over. But when the appropriate time comes, there should not be any concern about the ECB’s ability to exit. Indeed, most of our non-standard measures will be phased out naturally. Furthermore, we have a clearly defined mandate and complete independence, which ensure that we can act when we believe it to be appropriate.Over the past decade, we have established a strong track record for acting in a way that is independent, timely and fully in line with our mandate to maintain price stability.Central banks are not the only authorities that need a credible exit strategy. The governments, too, need such a strategy. Their response was instrumental in avoiding a collapse of the financial system and in halting the sharp decline in economic activity. But that response also entailed significant costs. The debt and budget deficits of a number of euro area governments have reached worrying levels. That is why there is an increasingly pressing need for ambitious and realistic fiscal exit strategies and for fiscal consolidation.Let me now turn to the global response to the crisis. In my view, there are three main lessons to be learnt:first, the need to build a more resilient financial sector;second, the need to implement solutions at the global level; andthird, the need for all policy-makers to contribute to financial, macroeconomic and price stability over the medium and longer term.At the outset, it is worth acknowledging the fundamental role that the financial sector plays in the functioning of our economies. It is a key part of the services sector, the infrastructure that makes it possible for us to do our jobs and run our businesses efficiently and effectively.The basic role of the financial sector is to channel funds from savers to investors, from lenders to borrowers. This facilitates the efficient allocation of resources and the efficient diversification of risk both within an economy and across borders.But looking back on the years before the crisis erupted, we can see that there was a dramatic shift in focus in large parts of the financial sector – away from facilitating business, trade and real investment towards unfettered speculation and financial gambling.Financial liberalisation, deregulation and innovation all have the potential to make our economies more productive and resilient. But if financial innovation is ill-designed and opaque, it can be used to conceal the true risk of financial products and instruments. The current crisis developed because individual risks in the financial sector were underpriced and systemic risk was underestimated. Several authorities, including some central banks, had warned about the possibility of abrupt repricing in the financial sector. These warnings date back to 2006. However, while it was perceived that a storm was brewing, it was not known exactly what would trigger it.Looking forward, the financial sector will have to return to its traditional role of providing a service to the real economy. This, above all, requires a change in mentality within the financial industry itself. More specifically, the financial industry has to increase transparency, strengthen its management of liquidity and risk, and make its business models more robust. It will also need to align the incentives of its employees to longer-term success rather than short-term profits. Our fellow citizens will not tolerate a relapse into excessive risk-taking at the expense of taxpayers.Financial regulation and supervision will be significantly enhanced. Financial regulation will have to focus on strengthening banks’ capital buffers, making compensation more consistent with long-term success and improving the transparency of financial instruments. Financial supervision will have to focus on detecting developments in the financial sector that could eventually lead to systemic crisis.This brings me to my second point, namely that there is an overwhelming need to implement reform simultaneously and homogeneously at the global level. The crisis has shown that no country can escape the shock waves of a financial meltdown. Accordingly, any reform effort that stops at national borders will prove futile.For us in Europe, international cooperation on financial reform has two dimensions: first, cooperation within the European Union and, second, cooperation across the globe.Institutional reform within the European Union follows a two-pronged approach: first, there is the creation of the European System of Financial Supervisors. This is aimed at achieving better coordination among national authorities responsible for financial regulation, in particular with respect to how they coordinate the monitoring of activities of European financial institutions that cross national borders.Second, there is the creation of the European Systemic Risk Board. This new body will endeavour to provide early-warnings and issue recommendations that will help to prevent a renewed build-up of excessive risk in the financial system as a whole. The ECB and the National Central Banks in the EU will play a key role in this new institutional framework. But close cooperation must not halt at Europe’s borders either. Given the strong interlinks between financial centres, a global approach is essential.* * *Governance in the global economy has evolved substantially over the past few decades. At the time of the first oil crisis in the mid-1970s, the major industrialised countries saw the need for an international body to allow a regular exchange of information between major economies. This paved the way for the creation of the G‑7. The G‑7 assembled the seven economies that were most important at the time for world output and international trade. Today, the ECB together with three national central banks represents the Eurosystem in the G‑7.While the G-7 still have an important role to play, the financial crisis has confirmed the need to reinforce global governance at the level of a more inclusive international informal entity, bringing together the major countries and global institutions. Three weeks ago, at the Pittsburgh summit, it was decided to make the G‑20 the premier forum for international economic cooperation.I personally have been involved in the G‑7 discussions in various functions for 22 years. The G‑7 remain a useful forum for exchange among the major industrialised economies which, after all, share a major responsibility in the origin of the recent crisis.I also witnessed the creation of the G‑20 after the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. It was an important step to involve the emerging economies more closely in the process of global economic governance. And I am therefore in the present very demanding circumstances, in full accord with this strengthened role of the G‑20.The aspect that impresses me most about this emerging global forum is the virtually universal consensus on global economic issues that has been reached. There is a broad consensus at the level of the G‑20 on the diagnosis of the crisis. There is a broad consensus on the appropriate response to the crisis. And there is a broad consensus on the direction of financial sector reform, along with the main ideas I described a moment ago.There is also agreement that macroeconomic policies at the domestic level need to be consistent with the objective of global financial and economic stability. Global macroeconomic imbalances were a fundamental driver of the financial crisis.What is needed going forward is to eradicate short-termism in macroeconomic policy and to replace it with a medium-term orientation that enhances stability. This focus on the medium term, which is a core element of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy, has greatly facilitated our task of maintaining price stability in the euro area, both at times of heightened inflationary pressures and at times of deflationary risks stemming from financial distress. I am convinced that a clear commitment to a medium-term orientation will have beneficial effects in all policy areas and all regions of the world.All these efforts will help to create an environment that is conducive to financial stability. But success hinges first and foremost on a significant change of behaviour and risk management within the financial industry itself. Policy-makers, supervisors and regulators around the world will have to ensure that the financial industry does indeed draw the appropriate lessons from the crisis.I have spoken about the lessons to be learnt from the financial crisis, and about the progress made so far in repairing the global financial system. Central banks and governments around the world have taken bold action. This action has borne fruit and revived what seemed a very scarce resource to me only a few months ago: confidence in the future.More needs to be done. The agenda for financial reform recently agreed at the G‑20 needs to be implemented decisively. The financial industry needs to change fundamentally. It needs to put more emphasis on robust business models, sound balance sheets and far better management of liquidity and risk. Macroeconomic policy-makers around the globe need to renew their commitment to medium-term stability.We should also not forget that the need for structural reforms over and beyond the financial sector is more urgent than ever. The financial and economic crisis has revealed structural weaknesses even more clearly. The financial crisis has not eliminated the need for structural reform in other areas; it has merely displaced them from the headlines. Reforms to tackle the impact of demographic ageing and to strengthen Europe’s potential for future growth in output remain clear priorities for policy-makers in the euro area.* * *Allow me to conclude, to say a few words about the role of the euro. The last two years have shown us its value in mind. The euro is not just a fair-weather currency. He has proved to be an anchor of stability in a stormy sea. The most important decision-making body for the euro is the Governing Council, in which we - our decisions collegially - the Board members of the ECB and the governors of the euro area. As I speak here in Germany, I would like to mention my fellow Governing Council Juergen Stark and Axel Weber. In the past members like Hans Tietmeyer and Otmar Issing have made vital contributions.Without the euro, tensions between the countries in the euro area would not have been excluded. This would have made our company in addition to create.In retrospect, one can adopt the euro almost eleven years ago, as a forward-looking and see Europe's response to the challenges of today. You and all 330 million citizens of the euro area can rely on: the ECB is its responsibility for a stable European currency continue to play.Thank you for your attention.[1] The remainder includes the category “don’t know”.Reproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.

contact,"<p>Sehr geehrter Herr Präsident Weinkauf,</p><p>sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,</p><p>herzlichen Dank für Ihre Einladung. Ich freue mich sehr, heute hier zu sein.</p><p>Der Wirtschaftstag mit über 2.500 hier im Saal anwesenden Unternehmern ist eine wichtige Veranstaltung. Er versammelt den deutschen Mittelstand, der zu Recht als das Rückgrat der Wirtschaft bezeichnet wird. Die zentrale Rolle des Mittelstands ist ein Wesensmerkmal der deutschen Wirtschaft und der europäischen Wirtschaft. Dessen sind wir uns bei der Europäischen Zentralbank sehr bewusst. Wir wissen, dass vor allem der Mittelstand auf die Kreditversorgung durch Banken angewiesen ist, und unsere Maßnahmen im letzten Jahr zielen nicht zuletzt darauf ab, den Banken auch in der Krise die Kreditvergabe zu ermöglichen.</p><p>Dem Mittelstand wohnt eine Eigenschaft inne, die ich besonders schätze: die Orientierung an der langen Frist. </p><p>Innovationsfreude gepaart mit der Geduld, auf die Früchte der Investition zu warten, bildet die Quelle unseres Wohlstands. Die Finanzkrise hat gezeigt, dass diese langfristige Sicht leider nicht in allen Sektoren und Ländern gleich gut verankert war.</p><p>Die Krise hat sich – einem starken Erdbeben gleich – in der ganzen Welt verbreitet und vor keinem Sektor halt gemacht. Das Epizentrum lag weit entfernt, aber die Schockwellen waren stark genug, um die Menschen im Eurogebiet zu erreichen. Hier und anderswo sank die Wirtschaftsleistung so stark wie nie seit dem 2. Weltkrieg.</p><p>Meine Rede möchte ich drei Themen widmen: erstens, den aktuellen Kreditbedingungen im Euroraum, zweitens den Maßnahmen der EZB zur Unterstützung der Kreditvergabe und drittens den internationalen Bemühungen, die Krise einzudämmen und das Finanzsystem robuster zu machen. Erlauben Sie mir dazu bitte, auf Englisch fortzufahren.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Let me start with an issue that is sure to be close to your hearts – namely access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises so as to allow them develop their businesses. To gain a deeper understanding of what is going on in this key part of the economy, we recently launched a new survey, in conjunction with the European Commission. In June and July this year, more than 6,000 firms in the euro area were interviewed about what has been happening in their businesses. Perhaps some of you here today took part.</p><p>The results of the survey paint a picture that I think you will recognise. The firms reported that they were having difficulties in finding customers, that their turnover and profits were falling and that bank loans were harder to come by. The survey also indicates that the crisis has been at least as severe for small and medium sized firms as for larger ones.</p><p>The results of the survey seem to be in line with our general assessment of credit conditions in the euro area. Most notably, around three out of five small and medium-sized firms that had applied for a bank loan in the first half of 2009 received the requested amount in full. Around one in five received the requested amount in part. And only about one in ten had the loan application rejected. </p><p>[</p><p>1</p><p>]</p><p>Such results do not point to a severe rationing of credit, although both this survey and surveys of banks indicate that credit standards have been tightened. </p><p>We are closely monitoring the access to finance of small and medium-sized enterprises. We will also repeat the survey every six months so as to ensure that the business conditions you face are monitored continuously.</p><p>Let me now first turn to the ECB’s response to the crisis.</p><p>Emergencies – such as the financial “earthquake” we all experienced last autumn following the collapse of a major bank in the United States – call for swift and forceful action by the responsible authorities. The ECB demonstrated its alertness from the very first day. In fact, when the problems in financial markets first became apparent on 9 August 2007, we were the first central bank to respond, acting within hours.</p><p>At this point, I think it is useful to remind you of the ECB’s responsibilities. Our primary mandate is the maintenance of price stability over the medium term. This was laid down in the Treaty on European Union, signed by Europe’s leaders in Maastricht back in 1992. The Governing Council aims to keep inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</p><p>All our monetary policy decisions during the last eleven years have been aiming at delivering price stability in the medium term.</p><p>After the intensification of the crisis mid September 2008, as inflationary pressures receded, in full consistency with our mandate, we decided to reduce our policy interest rate rapidly between October 2008 and May 2009. We are currently refinancing banks at 1%, an interest rate level that has not been experienced in the countries of the euro area at any time in recent history.</p><p>And we have gone beyond the standard monetary policy approach of changing interest rates. We have adopted several “non-standard” measures that I have previously described as our policy of “enhanced credit support”. The measures were designed to ensure that our interest rate reductions were transmitted to the broader economy, despite the problems in the financial sector. In particular, the aim has been to enable banks to continue their lending to households and firms.</p><p>To this end, we have supplied as much liquidity since October last year as banks have asked for, at fixed rates. We have also expanded the already long list of collateral that we accept in these market operations. And we have provided liquidity for longer periods than we have done in the past.</p><p>In June this year, we conducted the first one-year operation, providing banks with credit against securities at 1% for one year. We had a record allotment of €442 billion in this operation. In the second such operation, a few weeks ago in late September, we supplied banks with €75 billion, again at an interest rate of 1% for one year.</p><p>In cooperation with other central banks, we have moreover provided liquidity in foreign currencies, most notably US dollars. This was because euro area banks were experiencing difficulties in obtaining the foreign currency they needed.</p><p>These measures can all be seen as an expansion of our normal market operations with banks.

Today, the ECB together with three national central banks represents the Eurosystem in the G‑7.</p><p>While the G-7 still have an important role to play, the financial crisis has confirmed the need to reinforce global governance at the level of a more inclusive international informal entity, bringing together the major countries and global institutions. Three weeks ago, at the Pittsburgh summit, it was decided to make the G‑20 the premier forum for international economic cooperation.</p><p>I personally have been involved in the G‑7 discussions in various functions for 22 years. The G‑7 remain a useful forum for exchange among the major industrialised economies which, after all, share a major responsibility in the origin of the recent crisis.</p><p>I also witnessed the creation of the G‑20 after the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. It was an important step to involve the emerging economies more closely in the process of global economic governance. And I am therefore in the present very demanding circumstances, in full accord with this strengthened role of the G‑20.</p><p>The aspect that impresses me most about this emerging global forum is the virtually universal consensus on global economic issues that has been reached. There is a broad consensus at the level of the G‑20 on the diagnosis of the crisis. There is a broad consensus on the appropriate response to the crisis. And there is a broad consensus on the direction of financial sector reform, along with the main ideas I described a moment ago.</p><p>There is also agreement that macroeconomic policies at the domestic level need to be consistent with the objective of global financial and economic stability. Global macroeconomic imbalances were a fundamental driver of the financial crisis.</p><p>What is needed going forward is to eradicate short-termism in macroeconomic policy and to replace it with a medium-term orientation that enhances stability. This focus on the medium term, which is a core element of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy, has greatly facilitated our task of maintaining price stability in the euro area, both at times of heightened inflationary pressures and at times of deflationary risks stemming from financial distress. I am convinced that a clear commitment to a medium-term orientation will have beneficial effects in all policy areas and all regions of the world.</p><p>All these efforts will help to create an environment that is conducive to financial stability. But success hinges first and foremost on a significant change of behaviour and risk management within the financial industry itself. Policy-makers, supervisors and regulators around the world will have to ensure that the financial industry does indeed draw the appropriate lessons from the crisis.</p><p>I have spoken about the lessons to be learnt from the financial crisis, and about the progress made so far in repairing the global financial system. Central banks and governments around the world have taken bold action. This action has borne fruit and revived what seemed a very scarce resource to me only a few months ago: confidence in the future.</p><p>More needs to be done. The agenda for financial reform recently agreed at the G‑20 needs to be implemented decisively. The financial industry needs to change fundamentally. It needs to put more emphasis on robust business models, sound balance sheets and far better management of liquidity and risk. </p><p>Macroeconomic policy-makers around the globe need to renew their commitment to medium-term stability.</p><p>We should also not forget that the need for structural reforms over and beyond the financial sector is more urgent than ever. The financial and economic crisis has revealed structural weaknesses even more clearly. The financial crisis has not eliminated the need for structural reform in other areas; it has merely displaced them from the headlines. Reforms to tackle the impact of demographic ageing and to strengthen Europe’s potential for future growth in output remain clear priorities for policy-makers in the euro area.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Erlauben Sie mir zum Schluss, einige Worte zur Rolle des Euro zu sagen. Die letzten zwei Jahre haben uns seinen Wert vor Augen geführt. Der Euro ist keineswegs nur eine Schönwetterwährung. Er hat sich als Stabilitätsanker in stürmischer See erwiesen.

Jean-Claude Trichet: Hearing before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament,30-03-2009,European Central Bank,ECB,1736,"Madam President, distinguished members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs, I am delighted to be heard for the third time by the European Parliament since the beginning of this year, and for the second time by your commission. I do not forget either the joint meeting of the European Parliament and national parliaments in February. Today's meeting is the last scheduled during this term of office. It is therefore of particular importance. Allow me now to thank you for the exchange of views and rich stimulants that we have had over the last five years. It is no less than my twenty first hearing before your committee, which attests to the intensity of relations between the ECB and the elected representatives of European citizens.Today I want to focus on four themes: the current economic situation, the structure of the private mortgage lending in the euro area, the impact of the crisis to a future introduction of the euro in the Member States in Central and Eastern Europe and finally the proposals for the reform of banking supervision in Europe. I hope I therefore raise certain of the major issues before I place myself as usual your questions.Let me begin with the economic situation and our recent monetary policy decisions. Please note that, with only three days before our next monetary policy meeting this Thursday, I am in the so-called ""purdah"" period and will therefore duly remain with what I said at my last press conference. Since my appearance before the European Parliament on 21 January the economic situation and outlook have weakened further. Inflationary pressures have diminished further, as confirmed by monetary and credit trends. In February the inflation rate remained low, at 1.2%. As you know, the decline in inflation since last summer primarily reflects the sharp falls in global commodity prices over this period. Looking ahead, we expect inflation rates well below 2% for this year and 2010. The risks to this outlook are broadly balanced, but surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty.Following the substantial weakening of the world economy in the wake of the financial turmoil, real GDP growth in the euro area contracted markedly, by 1.5% on a quarterly basis, in the fourth quarter of 2008. The latest information suggests that economic activity has deteriorated further in the first quarter of 2009. Looking ahead, we expect demand to remain very weak throughout 2009, both at the global level and in the euro area, before gradually recovering in the course of 2010. As is the case for inflation, this outlook remains surrounded by uncertainty. Risks to this outlook seem to be more balanced. On the one hand, the positive impact of governments’ recent rescue packages for the banking sector and the macroeconomic stimulus that is now under way may be stronger than anticipated. On the other hand, the impact that the ongoing financial turmoil has on the real economy could be stronger than expected. In addition, protectionist tendencies are giving rise to considerable concern.It was against this background that the Governing Council reduced the key ECB interest rates by another 50 basis points in early March. This took the overall reduction in our key rates to 275 basis points since October of last year. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term. We will continue to deliver on our mandate and ensure the firm anchoring of inflation expectations over longer-term horizons. Such anchoring supports sustainable growth and employment and also contributes to financial stability. Let me also recall that the ECB has adjusted its liquidity management framework in order to counter the dysfunctional nature of the euro area money market. The most important measures decided upon in October 2008 were the use of fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for both main and longer-term refinancing operations and the extension until end-2009 of the list of assets eligible for use as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations. We have thereby provided the banking system with unlimited liquidity support, at fixed rates, with maturities of up to six months. We have just decided to maintain this procedure for as long as needed, and in any case beyond the end of 2009. As a result of all of these measures, most of which are highly non-standard, banks have continued to have broad access to euro liquidity.Let me now turn to the second topic, namely housing finance, which is covered in this year’s ECB Structural Issues Report. As in previous years, I will present to you the general thrust of our report, which will be published later today. The report analyses trends and differences in the characteristics of housing loans, in the funding of bank loans, and in the spread between mortgage interest rates and the funding costs of banks. It also compares housing finance in the euro area, the United Kingdom and the United States. Generally, euro area banks are significantly stricter in terms of non-interest conditions on loans, partly explaining the significantly smaller sub-prime market here. On the funding side, relatively stable bank deposits continue to be the main source of funding for bank loans in the euro area, with much less emphasis on the “originate-to-distribute” function. These observations support the conclusion that housing finance in the euro area should be more resilient to shocks. Housing finance has an impact on the transmission of monetary policy to the economy. Two observations deserve particular attention. On the one hand, a higher degree of competition among mortgage suppliers leads to a strengthening of that transmission. On the other hand, the introduction of greater flexibility in mortgage contracts via the temporary suspension of payment or maturity extensions would result in interest rate changes having a smaller immediate impact on the economy. Finally, it is clear that we have to assume a greater amount of retention on the part of banks, both as regards the amount and the characteristics of loans granted to households and as regards their sources of funding.Let me now turn to the third topic, which relates to the implications of the current crisis for euro area enlargement. The global economic situation has deteriorated significantly since September 2008 as a result of the intensification of the financial crisis. Some central and eastern European countries have also been hit hard, thus highlighting previous vulnerabilities. These weaknesses relate in particular to domestic and external imbalances, unsound fiscal policies, and domestic and external debt positions. However, it is very important to differentiate between the various countries in the region. A number of countries have shown a significant degree of resilience in these exceptionally difficult circumstances. And, not surprisingly, the countries that are most affected by the crisis are unfortunately those that had built up large imbalances and vulnerabilities in the past. Overall, the financial crisis has highlighted the importance of avoiding macroeconomic imbalances and following a sustainable growth path supported by a sufficient degree of structural reform. This is particularly true for “catching-up” economies, which have to balance the desire for swift convergence with the need to ensure the sustainability of the convergence process.The adoption of the euro can not be a substitute for the need of domestic policy adjustment. This would go against the economic logic which underlies the convergence process in Europe. And it is important to bear in mind that the premature adoption of the euro can make it more difficult for a country to cope with the challenges ahead. Without sustainable convergence, the monetary policy stance of the ECB would be inappropriate for the country concerned. In this case, the country in question could face the risk of excessive output and inflation volatility, as it would lack important tools to stabilise economic conditions at home. Thus, euro adoption cannot take place until major imbalances in the country have been eliminated and provided appropriate sustainable convergence has been achieved as required by the Treaty. I will now turn to the final topic, the review of the framework for financial supervision in the European Union. Already last autumn the European Parliament asked the ECB and the ESCB to play an active role in macro-prudential supervision and financial stability. Such a role is envisaged in the report by the high-level group chaired by Jacques de Larosière. I welcome its proposals on macro-prudential supervision, which relate in particular to a European Systemic Risk Council under the auspices of the ECB. Let me provide you with a few observations on this matter. First, the output of the Systemic Risk Council will make a major contribution to financial stability in the EU. In accordance with the de Larosière report, it will identify and assess risks and vulnerabilities in the EU financial system, issue risk warnings and adopt related policy recommendations. This will substantially improve the present arrangements for risk assessment at EU level. Second, the proposed composition of the Systemic Risk Council reflects a recognition of the role played by central banks in macro-prudential supervision. Third, the fact that the Systemic Risk Council would be set up under the auspices of the ECB and the ESCB would allow it to benefit from the analytical capabilities and technical infrastructures developed by central banks in its analysis of monetary and financial stability. In this context, the Systemic Risk Council will have to rely on a wide range of macro- and micro-prudential data. This implies that the ECB and the ESCB should have access to the relevant micro-prudential information from supervisors.Fourth, for the proposed macro-prudential framework to function as intended, it is crucial that risk warnings be translated into policy action as effectively as possible. In this context, the Systemic Risk Council should report its risk warnings and relevant recommendations to the ECOFIN Council.Finally, we should provide an appropriate institutional basis for the establishment of the Systemic Risk Council and the related new macro-prudential tasks of the ECB and ESCB, in order to ensure the necessary authority, accountability and legal capabilities. The activation of Article 105(6) of the Treaty could be a very useful avenue in this context. * * *I could not conclude today’s introductory remarks without very warmly thanking you, Madame la Présidente, and all the honourable members of the Committee for our regular exchanges of views over the past five years.

Messieurs les membres de la Commission économique et monétaire, je me réjouis d’être entendu pour la troisième fois par le Parlement européen depuis le début de cette année, et pour la deuxième fois par votre commission. Je n’oublie pas non plus la rencontre conjointe du Parlement européen et des parlements nationaux en février. La rencontre d’aujourd’hui est la dernière prévue au cours de cette mandature. Elle revêt donc une importance particulière. Permettez-moi dès à présent de vous remercier pour les échanges de vues stimulants et riches que nous avons eus au cours des cinq dernières années. Il ne s’agit pas moins de ma vingt-et-unième audition devant votre commission, ce qui atteste de l’intensité des relations entre la BCE et les représentants élus des citoyens européens.</p><p>Heute möchte ich mich auf vier Themen konzentrieren: die aktuelle wirtschaftliche Lage, die Struktur der Finanzierung privater Immobilien im Eurogebiet, die Auswirkungen der Krise auf eine zukünftige Einführung des Euro in den Mitgliedstaaten in Mittel- und Osteuropa und schließlich die Vorschläge zur Reform der Bankenaufsicht in Europa. Ich hoffe, dass ich damit auf einige der wichtigsten Themen eingehe, bevor ich mich wie üblich Ihren Fragen stelle.</p><p>Let me begin with the economic situation and our recent monetary policy decisions.

Jean-Claude Trichet: Europe – Cultural Identity – Cultural Diversity,16-03-2009,European Central Bank,ECB,5689,"Ladies and gentlemen,I was very touched by the invitation sent to me by the President of the Center for Financial Studies. He proposed that I give a lecture on ‘Europe – Cultural Identity – Cultural Diversity’. I was particularly moved for three reasons.First, because it was an invitation from Prof. Otmar Issing, my dear friend, good companion and former colleague on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank. Together with the other members of the Executive Board, we have always been united in steering the bank towards price stability, in compliance with the Maastricht Treaty, and in an environment which was exceptionally demanding. And it still is – to say the least! These close working relationships form the remarkable team spirit which exists within the Executive Board. But, and that is perhaps less well known, from time to time Otmar and I talked about Goethe’s poems, Heine’s ‘Lorelei’ and about literature and poetry in general. He must have been thinking about these intense, even though short, poetry discussions when he rather unconventionally asked me, a fellow central banker, to give a lecture on European cultural diversity.The second reason for being moved by the invitation is that the ECB regards Europe’s cultural diversity – which is fully reflected in the multinational character of its members of staff, who come from all 27 EU Member States – as a major asset. The ECB actively raises awareness of the cultural diversity of the European Union as one of the main elements of Europe’s cultural unity. It is the main purpose of the ‘Cultural Days’, which the ECB has been organising with great success for several years.My third reason for welcoming the invitation to speak is because I am convinced that economic and cultural affairs, that money and literature and poetry, are much more closely linked than many people believe. There are a number of examples; let me give you three. Firstly, we should recall that writing came into being in Sumer, the cradle of civilisation between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, 6000 years ago. Sumer’s administrators made a record of everyday items, of quantities, of transactions, on clay tablets. By recording these economic activities, these “proto-accountants” created the first documents in human history and paved the way for all of the world’s written literature. Secondly, there is a relationship between poetry and money which has always struck me. Poems, like gold coins, are meant to last, to keep their integrity, sustained by their rhythm, rhymes and metaphors. In that sense, they are like money – they are a ‘store of value’ over the long term. They are both aspiring to inalterability, whilst they are both destined to circulate from hand to hand and from mind to mind.And thirdly, both culture and money, poems and coins belong to the people. Our currency belongs to the people of Europe in a very deep sense: it is their own confidence in their currency which makes it a successful medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value. Our culture is the wealth of literature and art that the confidence of the people has decided to select and preserve over time.Today, I would like to reflect on Europe’s cultural identity first by exploring a central concept, a spiritual core; then I’ll review the remarkable diversity of its national cultures; and finally I’ll consider how European cultural identity aspires to universality.One way of shedding light on the cultural identity of Europe is to search for a central concept, a ‘heart’ of Europe, which would simultaneously be both its source and summary. Two references are particularly enlightening in this respect: the vision of Paul Valéry, the poet and essayist, and that of Edmund Husserl, the philosopher.Paul Valéry, In His essay 'The European' [ 'The European'], wrote in 1924: ""Wherever the names of Caesar, Gaius, Trajan and Virgil, wherever the names of Moses and St Paul, wherever the names of Aristotle, Plato and Euclid had a meaning and a concurrent authority, There is Europe.”  Translated into English, this means: “Wherever the names Caesar, Gaius, Trajan and Virgil, wherever the names Moses and St. Paul, wherever the names Aristotle, Plato and Euclid have a significance and carry weight, that is where Europe is.” Valery insists on the spiritual character of Europe by Adding: ""It is remarkable that the man Europe is not defined by race, nor language, nor by customs, but by desires and by the magnitude of willingness (…). ""In --other words,"" It is remarkable que le people of Europe are not defined by race, by language nor customs gold purpose by desires and breadth of will (...) "".We can indeed imagine, like Valéry, the cultural identity of Europe as being a remarkable expansion of the union, achieved under the Roman Empire, of Greek thought, Roman law and of the Bible, which has given rise to three monotheistic religions. We could still go further in our search for Europe’s conceptual heart. It is what Husserl proposes in his famous Vienna lecture of May 1935 entitled ‘Philosophy and the Crisis of European Humanity’. He sees the origin of the spiritual idea of Europe as being in Greece, where a handful of men initiated a radical conversion of all cultural life in their own nation and among their neighbours. Let me quote Husserl in the original German version: ""It is now also clear that from here could arise from an over nationality entirely new kind. of course I mean the spiritual shape of Europe. It is no longer a juxtaposition of different nations that interact only through trade and infighting, but: There is a new spirit of philosophy and its specialized sciences or esterified; a spirit of free criticism and normalization to endless tasks out he rules the humanity, creating new, infinite ideals! ""I would translate this into English as follows: “One can also see that it’s the starting point of a new kind of community, one which extends beyond nations. I am referring, of course, to Europe in a spiritual form. It is now no longer a number of different nations living alongside each other and only influencing each other through commercial competition or power struggles, but it is: a new spirit – stemming from philosophy and the sciences based on it – a spirit of free criticism, providing norms for infinite tasks, and it dominates mankind, creating new, infinite ideals.”Husserl says that Europe fully identifies with its Greek origins, in the spirit of philosophy. Thus, Europe’s ‘crisis’ comes from the apparent failure of rationalism. And he concludes his lecture, delivered in 1935, in a pointed, visionary way, without even naming totalitarianism, fascism or nazism: “Europe’s existential crisis can end in only one of two ways: in its demise, alienated from its own rational sense of life, and lapsing into a hatred of the spirit and into barbarism; or in its rebirth from the spirit of philosophy, through a heroism of reason (…)”. Such returns to the sources of the “spiritual form of Europe” are necessary and enlightening. They give us powerful threads of the cultural identity of Europe across two millennia. That all the national cultures draw mainly – but not exclusively – on the same original sources largely explains the cultural unity of Europe over the course of time. But they can and must be complemented by an analysis of European national cultures themselves and of the close and complex relationships between these highly diverse cultures which ensure the cultural unity of Europe. Cultural identity and unity amid the diversity of national cultures does not amount to the simple indefinite expansion of an original cultural core. I see Europe’s cultural identity as a tightly woven fabric. This fabric consists on the one hand of a warp thread carefully stretched, which corresponds to the many strong national cultures, which themselves have their own identity and find their origins in a distant past; on the other hand, there is the weft thread, which represents the interwoven transnational bedazzlement and admiration, the reciprocal influences crossing the frontiers between cultures and between languages. I imagine this literary, artistic, linguistic, European cultural fabric as drawing its beauty, its unity and its solidity from the sheer number and diversity of its threads.To illustrate this, I would like to give you some striking examples, some moving testimonies of this admiration and of these ‘transfrontier’ discoveries.It will come as no surprise to you that, as I have been invited by the Center for Financial Studies of Frankfurt University, I’ll mention Goethe. He writes in ‘Dichtung und Wahrheit’ about his discovery of Shakespeare: “Und so wirkte in unserer Straßburger Sozietät Shakespeare, übersetzt und im Original, stückweise und im ganzen, […] dergestalt, dass, wie man bibelfeste Männer hat, wir uns nach und nach in Shakespeare festigten. Mehr und mehr bildeten wir die Tugenden und Mängel seiner Zeit, mit denen er uns bekannt macht, in unseren Gesprächen nach […]. Das freudige Bekennen, dass etwas Höheres über mir schwebte, war ansteckend für meine Freunde, die sich alle dieser Sinnesart hingaben.“Translated into English, he says that “Shakespeare, both in translation and the original, in excerpts and as a whole, became so great a force within our Strasbourg coterie that, just as some men are very well versed in Scripture, we gradually became well versed in Shakespeare. In our speech we imitated the virtues and vices of our time that he had shown us […]. The joyful revelation that something sublime was hovering above me proved contagious to my friends, who all adopted my sentiment”. Goethe translates Voltaire’s ‘Mahomet’ and ‘Tancrède’, as well as ‘Rameau’s Nephew’ by Diderot, which Schiller had passed on to him. In a letter to Schiller, Goethe says of Diderot’s work: “Die Bombe dieses Gesprächs platzt gerade in der Mitte der französischen Literatur.” In English, “This dialogue explodes like a bomb right at the very heart of French literature”. Because of Goethe, ‘Rameau’s Nephew’ is famous in Germany long before it is in France!Goethe’s influence on other cultures is itself extraordinary. The publication of ‘Werther’ turned Europe upside down. It was one of the books Bonaparte took with him on his expedition to Egypt, and when he meets Goethe he wants to talk about it. Eckermann subsequently asks Goethe about that conversation with Bonaparte and says: “Napoléon pointed out to you a passage in ‘Werther’ which, it appeared to him, would not withstand a thorough examination, and you say he’s right. I would like to know which passage he meant. –“Raten Sie!” [“Guess!”], said Goethe, with a mysterious smile. [1]Eckermann, having suggested the passage in which Charlotte sends a pistol to Werther, notes that Goethe replies to him: “Ihre Bemerkung, ist freilich nicht schlecht. Ob aber Napoleon dieselbe Stelle gemeint hat oder eine andere, halte ich nicht für gut zu verraten.” [“Your remark certainly isn’t bad (…) but I don’t think it is right to reveal whether Napoléon meant this passage or another”.]I find a moving testimony to this same European literary fabric of transnational and translinguistic admiration in the first phrase of the Chateaubriand’s draft address to the Académie française – an address which was censored by Bonaparte himself: “When Milton published ‘Paradise Lost’, no voice was raised in any of Great Britain’s three kingdoms to praise a work that is one of the most beautiful monuments to the human spirit. The English Homer died forgotten, and his contemporaries left the task of immortalising the bard of Eden to future generations”.Dante Alighieri offers us another wonderful example of this influence and admiration which crosses time and space in Europe. ‘The Divine Comedy’ exerts an extremely powerful fascination over its European readers. Five centuries after its creation, William Blake comments, in the margin of the translation of the Inferno by Henri Boyd: “The grandest poetry is immoral, the grandest characters wicked, very Satan : (…) Cunning and morality are not poetry but philosophy (…) Poetry is to excuse vice, and show its reason and necessary purgation.” [2] Marcel Proust’s ‘In Search of Lost Time’ is strongly inspired by the work of Dante. More than 600 years after the ‘The Divine Comedy’ Proust writes, when seeing a water lily in a small river: “[The lily] would drift over to one bank only to return to the other, eternally repeating its double journey (…) like one of those wretches whose peculiar torments (…) aroused the curiosity of Dante, who would have enquired of them at greater length from the victims themselves, had not Virgil (…) obliged him to hasten after him at full speed, as I must hasten after my parents.” [3] Let’s move from Proust to Ismail Kadare, a contemporary writer. He writes that, as a schoolboy in Albania, he found himself at the age of 13 or 14 coming across “two groups of cantos (which) were quoted more often than the others in books, magazines, newspapers: those on Paolo and Francesca, the tragic lovers who didn’t know any respite in the second circle of the Inferno and those on Count Ugolino in the ninth circle, who, famished, ended up eating his own children. According to Kadare, Dante’s influence on popular Albanian culture is so strong that there are plenty of “Beatrices” in his country, “divided in equal proportions among Christians and Muslims in the civil registers”. [4]Dante brings to Italy the ‘terza rima’, or triplet rhyme, which structures the poem in tercets closely linked to the preceding and following rhymes, so that a rhyme is never introduced that has not been framed by two earlier rhymes, with the exception of the first tercet of the canto. This new verse form – which creates an impression of fast, breathless movement, while offering the permanence of an unchangeable structure – was to be an instant success: Boccaccio and Petrarch adopted it immediately. Dante himself borrowed it from another language, Provençal: the ‘sirventès’, a lyric form which goes back to the troubadours used the ‘terza rima’ or triplet rhyme. It was another example of the felicitous influence of a crossover between two forms of vernacular language: Provençal and Italian.But the extraordinary influence of Dante is perhaps not only explained by his genius and his verse technique. Other European influences may explain the emotional power of ‘The Divine Comedy’. Thirty years before the birth of Dante, Boncompagno da Signa, a professor of rhetoric from Bologna, publishes the ‘Rhetorica Novissima’.  In his chapter on memory, he adapts the classical ‘Art of Memory’ [5] – the technique utilised by the Greek and Roman orators to memorise their speeches – and transforms it into a powerful artificial memory of virtues and vices, of Paradise and Inferno. The historian Frances Yates comments that ‘The Divine Comedy’ can be interpreted as a work embodying the contemporary adaptation of the classical ‘Art of Memory’. If we accept that interpretation, it is necessary to consider Dante as having been indirectly influenced by the founder of the ‘Art of Memory’, the Greek poet Simonides of Ceos, who also influenced the Latin authors – Quintilian and the unknown author of the ‘Rhetorica ad Herennium’ – and subsequently the fathers of the church Saint Albertus Magnus and Saint Thomas Aquinas, and ultimately Boncompagno da Signa. [6]Dante touches Europe’s collection of cultures today, seven centuries after writing ‘The Divine Comedy’. He himself indirectly drew the memory power of his poem from the Greek Simonides 18 centuries before. We can see how the cultural fabric of Europe extends over 25 centuries.Following the course of a poetic metaphor down the centuries, across borders and between languages is another marvel of European culture. The same Simonides of Ceos writes: “For the soldiers who died at Thermopylae…hymns rather than tears, odes rather than wailing: a monument which neither rust nor devouring time could destroy”.This metaphor of the poem as an ‘indestructible monument’ was later used by Horace in his ‘Odes’: “I have completed a monument more lasting than bronze and far higher than that royal pile of pyramids which the rain cannot destroy, nor the endless sequence of years or the swift passing of time (…)”. The metaphor was also used by Ovid, Boccaccio, Ronsard, and by du Bellay in ‘Les antiquités de Rome’, which was translated by Spenser as ‘The Ruins of Rome’ and which inspired Shakespeare to write in his magnificent sonnet 55: “Not marble, nor the gilded monuments / Of Princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme”. This beautiful sonnet deals with the immortality of the person loved, of the feelings she inspires and of the unchanging nature of the poem itself. Its central metaphor dates back two thousand years to Simonides, and has travelled down the centuries and across the frontiers of the Greek, Latin, Italian, French and English languages. There is no finer example of the numerous threads that form the very fabric of European culture. This weave, this ‘indestructible monument’ made of words, spanning time and space, from Simonides to du Bellay and Shakespeare, is Europe’s cultural unity!The writer Cees Nooteboom in “De ontvoering van Europa” [The Abduction of Europe] gives his personal interpretation of Europe’s cultural unity and diversity: “If I am European – and I hope I am starting to get there after almost 60 years of determined effort – this surely means that Europe’s multiculturalism profoundly influences my Dutch identity”.Isn’t this what being European is all about? We must fully assume our national cultural identity, not only because it is the foundation of our own intellect and sensitivity, but also because Europe’s rich cultural variety and its national roots are what make it unique. It is this huge cultural endowment, with all its diversity, that gives Europeans their European identity.European-ness means being unable to understand fully my national literature and poetry –Chateaubriand, Mallarmé, Julien Gracq, St John Perse, Senghor – without understanding Dante, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Goethe and Heine. European-ness means that I share with all other Europeans the same basic cultural sources, despite the fact that they come from vastly differing backgrounds. This means that I live in a modern literary atmosphere that is influenced directly and indirectly by the Czech Kafka, the Irishman Joyce and the Frenchman Proust. And as the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset wrote in his ‘Revolt of the Masses’ in 1930, “Si hoy hiciésemos balance de nuestro contenido mental – opiniones, normas, deseos, presunciones – notaríamos que la mayor parte de todo eso no viene al francés de su Francia, ni al español de su España, sino del fondo común europeo”. I would translate this into English as follows: “If we were to take an inventory of our mental stock today – opinions, standards, desires, assumptions – we should discover that the greater part of it does not come to the Frenchman from France, nor to the Spaniard from Spain, but from the common European stock.”Writing about the unity of Europe, the historian Braudel mentioned what he termed the ‘unités brillantes’ (‘bright unities’), distinguishing them from the ‘unités aléatoires’ (‘uncertain unities’). The ‘unités brillantes’ cover all fields of artistic and intellectual endeavour, not only poetry, literature and philosophy but also music, painting, sculpture and architecture. It is no coincidence that the Governing Council of the European Central Bank chose European architectural styles to illustrate the banknotes of our single currency, the euro. It is amazing to see how widespread these styles are in Europe, with countless buildings, churches and monuments built in the Romanesque, Gothic, baroque and classical traditions. These architectural styles were born in very different areas of Europe, and demonstrate Europe’s cultural richness. They also provide another powerful illustration of this unique concept of unity within diversity, which is the central trait of our continent.I’d like now take a look at the art and cultural activities of the ECB. In view of our allegiance to the European ideal and its leitmotif of “unity in diversity”, we aim, through our activities beyond those relating to monetary policy, to help further Europeans’ understanding of one another and to raise awareness of the cultural wealth of Europe and its common cultural roots. Our goal is to bring the people of the Rhine-Main area, our visitors and our staff closer to the cultural diversity of the EU Member States and thus enable them to deepen their knowledge of what they have in common and what binds them together. It is also an aim of the ECB to encourage cooperation and exchanges within the European System of Central Banks, also in the area of cultural activities. In doing this, we concentrate on two areas of activity: first, the ECB has presented exhibitions of contemporary art since 1997. Once a year we hold an exhibition at our main building in Frankfurt providing insights into the contemporary art scene of one Member State of the EU. Each exhibition presents works from the fields of painting, drawing, print, installation, photography and sculpture by some 20 artists. The exhibitions are organised in collaboration with the national central bank of the country in question and generally also include works from its collection. The exhibitions regularly provide the ECB with the opportunity to purchase works for its own collection, so exhibitions and the formation of a collection go hand in hand. To date the ECB has presented 15 countries and also hosted three special exhibitions dedicated exclusively to the collections of central banks. These showed works from the collections of, in 2006, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, in 2006/07 the Federal Reserve Board, and in 2008, for the tenth anniversary of the European System of Central Banks, 18 central banks in Europe. The ECB’s collection currently comprises 170 works by 75 artists and is shown in the ECB's three buildings. The ECB offers regular tours of the exhibitions and the collection, for example on the corporate collections weekend held by the state of Hesse. Second, the ECB has held the ‘Cultural Days of the ECB’ since 2003. This event also takes place once a year, focuses on a particular Member State of the EU, and is organised in cooperation with the national central bank of the featured country. The programme provides a broad-ranging look at the cultural scene in the country and usually includes readings, concerts, films, theatre and dance performances, lectures and exhibitions. The events are mostly held outside the ECB and in cooperation with cultural institutions in Frankfurt – such as the Alte Oper, the Literaturhaus, the Deutsches Filmmuseum or the Mouson-Turm. In the last six years we have presented 198 events and 158 artists and ensembles, from promising newcomers and talented young artists, such as the Polish pianist Joanna Marcinkowska, to international greats such the Nobel prize-winning Hungarian author Imre Kertész or the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki, who have helped to shape the cultural legacy of the twentieth century. Our present art and cultural activities offer many examples of the unity in diversity that makes up Europe’s cultural identity. Let me give you only three examples of contemporary artists who illustrate very well the dense fabric of trans-frontier admiration and influence:Our collection includes two works by the Austrian painter Hubert Scheibl, one of the best-known representatives of the new abstraction of the 1990s. His works allude to the romantic landscape painting which reached its apogee in nineteenth century Europe in the work of J.M.W. Turner and Caspar David Friedrich. Like these artists before him, Scheibl attempts to capture the spirit of a mystical, pantheistic experience of nature. He too makes reference to the idea of the sublime – to experiences which are too overwhelming for our senses to be able to take in, in their entirety – to a concept which, since the eighteenth century, has recurred, time and again, in the works of philosophers such as Edmund Burke, Immanuel Kant and Jean-François Lyotard. In the twentieth century the concept of the sublime primarily shaped European and American abstract expressionism, to which Scheibl's works – with their subtly nuanced fields of colour and subjective gestures – are related.A second example would be the reading with literature Nobel laureate Imre Kertész, which was one of the high points of the Cultural Days dedicated to Hungary in 2005. The work of Kertész is embedded in the literary and intellectual history of the twentieth century like no other. At the centre of his works is the holocaust, which he sees as an indelible caesura in human history and which he puts at the heart of European history and modern existence. The descriptions of his protagonists are informed by the writings of Arthur Rimbaud and Jacques Lacan on split identities and multiple personalities. Rimbaud’s phrase “Je est un autre” was even used by Kertész as the basis for the title of his memoirs “I - Another: chronicle of a metamorphosis” which appeared in 1997. To earn a living under the communist regime in Hungary, Kertész translated works by Ludwig Wittgenstein, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Arthur Schnitzler, Joseph Roth and Elias Canetti, all of whom had a lasting influence on his thinking. In ‘Galley Diary’, a collection of observations, aphorisms and philosophical excursions which appeared in 1992, Kertész engages directly with great thinkers and poets of the twentieth century. In an internal dialogue with them he attempts to find the definitive answers to the holocaust and modernity, totalitarianism and freedom. Kertész cites as further inspirations popular literature such as penny-dreadfuls as well as Gustave Flaubert, with whom he shares a belief in the written word as the only truth. Finally, I would like to look at the medium of film. In line with the European focus of the last Cultural Days, we showed Lars von Trier’s internationally award-winning 1991 film ‘Europa’. Von Trier is one of the best-known film-makers of the modern age. His most important sources of inspiration include literature and classics of European and American cinema history. He has a fascination for the dark and mysterious moods which mark the stories of Franz Kafka and Joseph Conrad, both of whom inform his ‘Europa’ in a very tangible way: the basic idea for the film was based on Kafka’s fragment “America“ (1911-14) and Conrad’s ‘Heart of Darkness’ (1899). In particular his early works – to which ‘Europa’ belongs – are clearly influenced by German expressionist film of the 1920s, Italian neo-realism of the 1940s and the contemporaneous ‘film noir’ which emerged in the United States. Thus, in ‘Europa’, von Trier’s images and stylistic renderings allude to the main representatives of these decades: Fritz Lang, Alfred Hitchcock and Roberto Rossellini.Of course, there are many other revealing interrelationships within European culture to be discovered in our rich treasure trove of art exhibitions and Cultural Days programmes. We will remain committed to promoting cultural exchanges within Europe in the future and greatly look forward to the insights and experiences which the Romanian Cultural Days later this year will bring.Have we exhausted the deep significance and the rich cultural identity of Europe once we have identified its sources and got the measure of its remarkable diversity, with its tight weave of influences, of relationships and of mutual admiration extending beyond national frontiers and linguistic barriers? Doesn’t European culture have another fundamental characteristic that makes it unique among the world’s cultures?Jacques Derrida, the French philosopher, phrases the question this way in ‘ The other Cap’ [7]""You can love to remember that we are a European intellectual without wanting to be through. Feel European among other things, would be more or less European? Both probably (...). "". In --other words, ""It's nice to remind yourself That You are a European intellectual without wanting to be it through and through. Among European --other to feel things, does it mean Being More, or less, European? Both, without doubt. ""It’s precisely because Europe has been gradually built on the basis of a sincere and deep-seated recognition of its cultural diversity that it aspires to be universal. Its cultural unity does not mean confinement, introspection or isolation inside a cultural ‘fortress’. An integral part of its culture is its admiration and insatiable curiosity about the abundance of cultures beyond its shores. In the Sami text aussi Derrida says: ""How to take an adversarial responsibility that we registered in a sort of double bind: To be the guardians of an idea of ​​Europe, a difference of Europe, which consists precisely in not close on its own identity and to advance exemplary towards what is not it, to Cap the other (...). "" To put it in English: ""We need to accept a conflicting responsibility qui puts us in a kind of double bind: to Become the guardians of a concept of Europe and of Europe's distinctiveness, qui Consists not of closing oneself to one's own identity purpose of moving in an exemplary way Towards PRECISELY what is not one's own identity, Reviews towards the 'Other Cape'. ""Europe’s deep aspiration to universality is expressed in a particularly ambitious way by Husserl in the same lecture in Vienna that I mentioned earlier. He talked about “a spirit of free criticism…of creating new, infinite ideals…”, and he added that “…there are some ideals that exist for individuals in their nations, and other ideals for the nations themselves. But, ultimately, there are also infinite ideals for the spreading ‘synthesis’ of nations, and in that synthesis each of these nations gives its best to its partner nations precisely by aiming for its own ideal task in a universal spirit”. [8]Is it not remarkable that, at a global level, UNESCO refers to cultural diversity using words similar to those used by the European Union itself to promote its cultural diversity? Let us compare the two texts. Article 151 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which incorporates Article 128 of the Treaty of Maastricht, states: “The Community shall contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore”.Compare this with part of the preamble to UNESCO’s Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions: the General Conference of UNESCO is “Conscious that cultural diversity forms a common heritage of humanity and should be cherished and preserved for the benefit of all”.How does this diversity and universality, on which European unity is based, apply to the European Central Bank? Diversity is reflected, as I have already mentioned, by the fact that 27 nationalities are represented within the ECB, forming a single group and making a major contribution to our shared success. The ECB’s Governing Council itself represents a formidable example of diversity and unity. Together, we all fulfil our role of guiding Europe’s monetary team, the Eurosystem, consisting of the ECB and the 16 euro area national central banks, each with their own culture, language and history. And together with the 27 national central banks we make up the European System of Central Banks. We embrace this rich diversity, and it forms an integral part of our identity.We also aspire to universality. We are open to the world and in close contact with institutions on other continents. We aim to play as active a role as possible in the international financial institutions and international informal groups to which we belong, we always support a multilateral approach. We greatly value our discussions with central banks on other continents, and particularly the regular meetings of the Eurosystem with central banks in Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean region. As my final point, we are united because we have the eminent responsibility under the Maastricht Treaty as guardians of Europe’s single currency. Because Economic and Monetary Union is a magnificent undertaking that forms the basis of Europe’s prosperity and shared stability. And because the single currency is an emblem of Europe’s unity. The experience we have gained in this Economic and Monetary Union, based on the free will of the Member States, is exemplary in today’s globalised world that is rapidly integrating. It’s also why we are pleased to engage in close cooperation with institutions on other continents that are observing the ECB and the Eurosystem and thinking about the lessons they can draw from Europe’s unique experiences.I would like to end by quoting the philosopher and writer Ernest Renan, who defined a nation’s identity as follows: “In the past, it was a heritage of glory and of regrets to share together; in the future, it will be the same programme to be realised…”. [9] Europe has more than its fair share of past glory and regrets, and possesses a deep cultural unity in its diversity. The single currency is an essential part of this ‘programme to be realised’. We shall continue to offer the euro as a unique and irreplaceable anchor of stability and trust. In the present very difficult circumstances it is more important than ever. Europe can rely on us to preserve that anchor.Thank you for your attention.[1] Goethe’s conversations with Eckermann (2 January 1824).[2] William Blake “From the annotations to Henry Boyd’s ‘A Translation of the Inferno of Dante Alighieri’, Oxford Classics.

the President of the Center for Financial Studies. He proposed that I give a lecture on ‘Europe – Cultural Identity – Cultural Diversity’. I was particularly moved for three reasons.</p><p>First, because it was an invitation from Prof. Otmar Issing, my dear friend, good companion and former colleague on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank. Together with the other members of the Executive Board, we have always been united in steering the bank towards price stability, in compliance with the Maastricht Treaty, and in an environment which was exceptionally demanding. And it still is – to say the least! These close working relationships form the remarkable team spirit which exists within the Executive Board. </p><p>But, and that is perhaps less well known, from time to time Otmar and I talked about Goethe’s poems, Heine’s ‘Lorelei’ and about literature and poetry in general. He must have been thinking about these intense, even though short, poetry discussions when he rather unconventionally asked me, a fellow central banker, to give a lecture on European cultural diversity.</p><p>The second reason for being moved by the invitation is that the ECB regards Europe’s cultural diversity – which is fully reflected in the multinational character of its members of staff, who come from all 27 EU Member States – as a major asset. The ECB actively raises awareness of the cultural diversity of the European Union as one of the main elements of Europe’s cultural unity. It is the main purpose of the ‘Cultural Days’, which the ECB has been organising with great success for several years.</p><p>My third reason for welcoming the invitation to speak is because I am convinced that economic and cultural affairs, that money and literature and poetry, are much more closely linked than many people believe. There are a number of examples; let me give you three.</p><p> Firstly, we should recall that writing came into being in Sumer, the cradle of civilisation between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, 6000 years ago. Sumer’s administrators made a record of everyday items, of quantities, of transactions, on clay tablets. By recording these economic activities, these “proto-accountants” created the first documents in human history and paved the way for all of the world’s written literature. </p><p>Secondly, there is a relationship between poetry and money which has always struck me. Poems, like gold coins, are meant to last, to keep their integrity, sustained by their rhythm, rhymes and metaphors. In that sense, they are like money – they are a ‘store of value’ over the long term. They are both aspiring to inalterability, whilst they are both destined to circulate from hand to hand and from mind to mind.</p><p>And thirdly, both culture and money, poems and coins belong to the people. Our currency belongs to the people of Europe in a very deep sense: it is their own confidence in their currency which makes it a successful medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value. Our culture is the wealth of literature and art that the confidence of the people has decided to select and preserve over time.</p><p>Today, I would like to reflect on Europe’s cultural identity first by exploring a central concept, a spiritual core; then I’ll review the remarkable diversity of its national cultures; and finally I’ll consider how European cultural identity aspires to universality.</p><p>One way of shedding light on the cultural identity of Europe is to search for a central concept, a ‘heart’ of Europe, which would simultaneously be both its source and summary. Two references are particularly enlightening in this respect: the vision of Paul Valéry, the poet and essayist, and that of Edmund Husserl, the philosopher.</p><p>Paul Valéry, in his essay ‘The European’ [‘L’Européen’], wrote in 1924: “Partout où les noms de César, de Gaius, de Trajan et de Virgile, partout où les noms de Moïse et de St Paul, partout où les noms d’Aristote, de Platon et d’Euclide ont eu une signification et une autorité simultanées, </p><p>Là est l’Europe</p><p>.”  Translated into English, this means: “Wherever the names Caesar, Gaius, Trajan and Virgil, wherever the names Moses and St. Paul, wherever the names Aristotle, Plato and Euclid have a significance and carry weight, </p><p>that is where Europe is</p><p>.” </p><p>Valéry insists on the spiritual character of Europe by adding: “Il est remarquable que l’homme d’Europe n’est pas défini par la race, ni par la langue, ni par les coutumes mais par les désirs et par l’amplitude de la volonté (…). “In other words, “It is remarkable that the people of Europe are not defined by race, nor by language or customs, but by desires and breadth of will (…)”.</p><p>We can indeed imagine, like Valéry, the cultural identity of Europe as being a remarkable expansion of the union, achieved under the Roman Empire, of Greek thought, Roman law and of the Bible, which has given rise to three monotheistic religions. </p><p>We could still go further in our search for Europe’s conceptual heart. It is what Husserl proposes in his famous Vienna lecture of May 1935 entitled ‘Philosophy and the Crisis of European Humanity’. He sees the origin of the spiritual idea of Europe as being in Greece, where a handful of men initiated a radical conversion of all cultural life in their own nation and among their neighbours. </p><p>Let me quote Husserl in the original German version: “Es ist nun auch ersichtlich, dass von hier aus eine Übernationalität völlig neuer Art entspringen konnte. Ich meine natürlich die geistige Gestalt Europas. Es ist nicht mehr ein Nebeneinander verschiedener Nationen, die sich nur durch Handel- und Machtkämpfe beeinflussen, sondern: Es ist ein neuer Geist, von Philosophie und ihren Sonderwissenschaften herstammend; ein Geist, freier Kritik und Normierung auf unendliche Aufgaben hin, er durchherrscht das Menschentum, schafft neue, unendliche Ideale!” </p><p>I would translate this into English as follows: “One can also see that it’s the starting point of a new kind of community, one which extends beyond nations. I am referring, of course, to Europe in a spiritual form. It is now no longer a number of different nations living alongside each other and only influencing each other through commercial competition or power struggles, but it is: a new spirit – stemming from philosophy and the sciences based on it – a spirit of free criticism, providing norms for infinite tasks, and it dominates mankind, creating new, infinite ideals.”</p><p>Husserl says that Europe fully identifies with its Greek origins, in the spirit of philosophy. Thus, Europe’s ‘crisis’ comes from the apparent failure of rationalism. And he concludes his lecture, delivered in 1935, in a pointed, visionary way, without even naming totalitarianism, fascism or nazism: “Europe’s existential crisis can end in only one of two ways: in its demise, alienated from its own rational sense of life, and lapsing into a hatred of the spirit and into barbarism; or in its rebirth from the spirit of philosophy, through a heroism of reason (…)”. </p><p>Such returns to the sources of the “spiritual form of Europe” are necessary and enlightening. They give us powerful threads of the cultural identity of Europe across two millennia. That all the national cultures draw mainly – but not exclusively – on the same original sources largely explains the cultural unity of Europe over the course of time. But they can and must be complemented by an analysis of European national cultures themselves and of the close and complex relationships between these highly diverse cultures which ensure the cultural unity of Europe. </p><p>Cultural identity and unity amid the diversity of national cultures does not amount to the simple indefinite expansion of an original cultural core. I see Europe’s cultural identity as a tightly woven fabric. This fabric consists on the one hand of a warp thread carefully stretched, which corresponds to the many strong national cultures, which themselves have their own identity and find their origins in a distant past; on the other hand, there is the weft thread, which represents the interwoven transnational bedazzlement and admiration, the reciprocal influences crossing the frontiers between cultures and between languages. I imagine this literary, artistic, linguistic, European cultural fabric as drawing its beauty, its unity and its solidity from the sheer number and diversity of its threads.</p><p>To illustrate this, I would like to give you some striking examples, some moving testimonies of this admiration and of these ‘transfrontier’ discoveries.</p><p>It will come as no surprise to you that, as I have been invited by the Center for Financial Studies of Frankfurt University, I’ll mention Goethe. He writes in ‘Dichtung und Wahrheit’ about his discovery of Shakespeare: “Und so wirkte in unserer Straßburger Sozietät Shakespeare, übersetzt und im Original, stückweise und im ganzen, […] dergestalt, dass, wie man bibelfeste Männer hat, wir uns nach und nach in Shakespeare festigten. Mehr und mehr bildeten wir die Tugenden und Mängel seiner Zeit, mit denen er uns bekannt macht, in unseren Gesprächen nach […]. Das freudige Bekennen, dass etwas Höheres über mir schwebte, war ansteckend für meine Freunde, die sich alle dieser Sinnesart hingaben.“</p><p>Translated into English, he says that “Shakespeare, both in translation and the original, in excerpts and as a whole, became so great a force within our Strasbourg coterie that, just as some men are very well versed in Scripture, we gradually became well versed in Shakespeare. In our speech we imitated the virtues and vices of our time that he had shown us […]. The joyful revelation that something sublime was hovering above me proved contagious to my friends, who all adopted my sentiment”. </p><p>Goethe translates Voltaire’s ‘Mahomet’ and ‘Tancrède’, as well as ‘Rameau’s Nephew’ by Diderot, which Schiller had passed on to him. In a letter to Schiller, Goethe says of Diderot’s work: “Die Bombe dieses Gesprächs platzt gerade in der Mitte der französischen Literatur.” In English, “This dialogue explodes like a bomb right at the very heart of French literature”. Because of Goethe, ‘Rameau’s Nephew’ is famous in Germany long before it is in France!</p><p>Goethe’s influence on other cultures is itself extraordinary. The publication of ‘Werther’ turned Europe upside down. It was one of the books Bonaparte took with him on his expedition to Egypt, and when he meets Goethe he wants to talk about it. Eckermann subsequently asks Goethe about that conversation with Bonaparte and says: “Napoléon pointed out to you a passage in ‘Werther’ which, it appeared to him, would not withstand a thorough examination, and you say he’s right. I would like to know which passage he meant. –“Raten Sie!” [“Guess!”], said Goethe, with a mysterious smile. </p><p>[</p><p>1</p><p>]</p><p>Eckermann, having suggested the passage in which Charlotte sends a pistol to Werther, notes that Goethe replies to him: “Ihre Bemerkung, ist freilich nicht schlecht. Ob aber Napoleon dieselbe Stelle gemeint hat oder eine andere, halte ich nicht für gut zu verraten.” [“Your remark certainly isn’t bad (…) but I don’t think it is right to reveal whether Napoléon meant this passage or another”.]</p><p>I find a moving testimony to this same European literary fabric of transnational and translinguistic admiration in the first phrase of the Chateaubriand’s draft address to the Académie française – an address which was censored by Bonaparte himself: “When Milton published ‘Paradise Lost’, no voice was raised in any of Great Britain’s three kingdoms to praise a work that is one of the most beautiful monuments to the human spirit. The English Homer died forgotten, and his contemporaries left the task of immortalising the bard of Eden to future generations”.</p><p>Dante Alighieri offers us another wonderful example of this influence and admiration which crosses time and space in Europe. ‘The Divine Comedy’ exerts an extremely powerful fascination over its European readers. Five centuries after its creation, William Blake comments, in the margin of the translation of the Inferno by Henri Boyd: “The grandest poetry is immoral, the grandest characters wicked, very Satan : (…) Cunning and morality are not poetry but philosophy (…) Poetry is to excuse vice, and show its reason and necessary purgation.” </p><p>[</p><p>2</p><p>]</p><p> Marcel Proust’s ‘In Search of Lost Time’ is strongly inspired by the work of Dante. More than 600 years after the ‘The Divine Comedy’ Proust writes, when seeing a water lily in a small river: “[The lily] would drift over to one bank only to return to the other, eternally repeating its double journey (…) like one of those wretches whose peculiar torments (…) aroused the curiosity of Dante, who would have enquired of them at greater length from the victims themselves, had not Virgil (…) obliged him to hasten after him at full speed, as I must hasten after my parents.” </p><p>[</p><p>3</p><p>]</p><p> </p><p>Let’s move from Proust to Ismail Kadare, a contemporary writer. He writes that, as a schoolboy in Albania, he found himself at the age of 13 or 14 coming across “two groups of cantos (which) were quoted more often than the others in books, magazines, newspapers: those on Paolo and Francesca, the tragic lovers who didn’t know any respite in the second circle of the Inferno and those on Count Ugolino in the ninth circle, who, famished, ended up eating his own children. According to Kadare, Dante’s influence on popular Albanian culture is so strong that there are plenty of “Beatrices” in his country, “divided in equal proportions among Christians and Muslims in the civil registers”. </p><p>[</p><p>4</p><p>]</p><p>Dante brings to Italy the ‘terza rima’, or triplet rhyme, which structures the poem in tercets closely linked to the preceding and following rhymes, so that a rhyme is never introduced that has not been framed by two earlier rhymes, with the exception of the first tercet of the canto. This new verse form – which creates an impression of fast, breathless movement, while offering the permanence of an unchangeable structure – was to be an instant success: Boccaccio and Petrarch adopted it immediately. Dante himself borrowed it from another language, Provençal: the ‘sirventès’, a lyric form which goes back to the troubadours used the ‘terza rima’ or triplet rhyme. It was another example of the felicitous influence of a crossover between two forms of vernacular language: Provençal and Italian.</p><p>But the extraordinary influence of Dante is perhaps not only explained by his genius and his verse technique. Other European influences may explain the emotional power of ‘The Divine Comedy’. Thirty years before the birth of Dante, Boncompagno da Signa, a professor of rhetoric from Bologna, publishes the ‘Rhetorica Novissima’.  In his chapter on memory, he adapts the classical ‘Art of Memory’ </p><p>[</p><p>5</p><p>]</p><p> – the technique utilised by the Greek and Roman orators to memorise their speeches – and transforms it into a powerful artificial memory of virtues and vices, of Paradise and Inferno. The historian Frances Yates comments that ‘The Divine Comedy’ can be interpreted as a work embodying the contemporary adaptation of the classical ‘Art of Memory’. If we accept that interpretation, it is necessary to consider Dante as having been indirectly influenced by the founder of the ‘Art of Memory’, the Greek poet Simonides of Ceos, who also influenced the Latin authors – Quintilian and the unknown author of the ‘Rhetorica ad Herennium’ – and subsequently the fathers of the church Saint Albertus Magnus and Saint Thomas Aquinas, and ultimately Boncompagno da Signa. </p><p>[</p><p>6</p><p>]</p><p>Dante touches Europe’s collection of cultures today, seven centuries after writing ‘The Divine Comedy’. He himself indirectly drew the memory power of his poem from the Greek Simonides 18 centuries before. We can see how the cultural fabric of Europe extends over 25 centuries.</p><p>Following the course of a poetic metaphor down the centuries, across borders and between languages is another marvel of European culture. The same Simonides of Ceos writes: “For the soldiers who died at Thermopylae…hymns rather than tears, odes rather than wailing: a monument which neither rust nor devouring time could destroy”.</p><p>This metaphor of the poem as an ‘indestructible monument’ was later used by Horace in his ‘Odes’: “I have completed a monument more lasting than bronze and far higher than that royal pile of pyramids which the rain cannot destroy, nor the endless sequence of years or the swift passing of time (…)”. The metaphor was also used by Ovid, Boccaccio, Ronsard, and by du Bellay in ‘Les antiquités de Rome’, which was translated by Spenser as ‘The Ruins of Rome’ and which inspired Shakespeare to write in his magnificent sonnet 55: “Not marble, nor the gilded monuments / Of Princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme”. This beautiful sonnet deals with the immortality of the person loved, of the feelings she inspires and of the unchanging nature of the poem itself. Its central metaphor dates back two thousand years to Simonides, and has travelled down the centuries and across the frontiers of the Greek, Latin, Italian, French and English languages. There is no finer example of the numerous threads that form the very fabric of European culture. This weave, this ‘indestructible monument’ made of words, spanning time and space, from Simonides to du Bellay and Shakespeare, is Europe’s cultural unity!</p><p>The writer Cees Nooteboom in “De ontvoering van Europa” [The Abduction of Europe] gives his personal interpretation of Europe’s cultural unity and diversity: “If I am European – and I hope I am starting to get there after almost 60 years of determined effort – this surely means that Europe’s multiculturalism profoundly influences my Dutch identity”.</p><p>Isn’t this what being European is all about? We must fully assume our national cultural identity, not only because it is the foundation of our own intellect and sensitivity, but also because Europe’s rich cultural variety and its national roots are what make it unique. It is this huge cultural endowment, with all its diversity, that gives Europeans their European identity.</p><p>European-ness means being unable to understand fully my national literature and poetry –Chateaubriand, Mallarmé, Julien Gracq, St John Perse, Senghor – without understanding Dante, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Goethe and Heine. European-ness means that I share with all other Europeans the same basic cultural sources, despite the fact that they come from vastly differing backgrounds. This means that I live in a modern literary atmosphere that is influenced directly and indirectly by the Czech Kafka, the Irishman Joyce and the Frenchman Proust. And as the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset wrote in his ‘Revolt of the Masses’ in 1930, “Si hoy hiciésemos balance de nuestro contenido mental – opiniones, normas, deseos, presunciones – notaríamos que la mayor parte de todo eso no viene al francés de su Francia, ni al español de su España, sino del fondo común europeo”. I would translate this into English as follows: “If we were to take an inventory of our mental stock today – opinions, standards, desires, assumptions – we should discover that the greater part of it does not come to the Frenchman from France, nor to the Spaniard from Spain, but from the common European stock.”</p><p>Writing about the unity of Europe, the historian Braudel mentioned what he termed the ‘unités brillantes’ (‘bright unities’), distinguishing them from the ‘unités aléatoires’ (‘uncertain unities’). The ‘unités brillantes’ cover all fields of artistic and intellectual endeavour, not only poetry, literature and philosophy but also music, painting, sculpture and architecture. It is no coincidence that the Governing Council of the European Central Bank chose European architectural styles to illustrate the banknotes of our single currency, the euro. It is amazing to see how widespread these styles are in Europe, with countless buildings, churches and monuments built in the Romanesque, Gothic, baroque and classical traditions. These architectural styles were born in very different areas of Europe, and demonstrate Europe’s cultural richness. They also provide another powerful illustration of this unique concept of unity within diversity, which is the central trait of our continent.</p><p>I’d like now take a look at the art and cultural activities of the ECB. In view of our allegiance to the European ideal and its leitmotif of “unity in diversity”, we aim, through our activities beyond those relating to monetary policy, to help further Europeans’ understanding of one another and to raise awareness of the cultural wealth of Europe and its common cultural roots. </p><p>Our goal is to bring the people of the Rhine-Main area, our visitors and our staff closer to the cultural diversity of the EU Member States and thus enable them to deepen their knowledge of what they have in common and what binds them together. It is also an aim of the ECB to encourage cooperation and exchanges within the European System of Central Banks, also in the area of cultural activities. </p><p>In doing this, we concentrate on two areas of activity: first, the ECB has presented exhibitions of contemporary art since 1997. Once a year we hold an exhibition at our main building in Frankfurt providing insights into the contemporary art scene of one Member State of the EU. Each exhibition presents works from the fields of painting, drawing, print, installation, photography and sculpture by some 20 artists. The exhibitions are organised in collaboration with the national central bank of the country in question and generally also include works from its collection. The exhibitions regularly provide the ECB with the opportunity to purchase works for its own collection, so exhibitions and the formation of a collection go hand in hand. To date the ECB has presented 15 countries and also hosted three special exhibitions dedicated exclusively to the collections of central banks. These showed works from the collections of, in 2006, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, in 2006/07 the Federal Reserve Board, and in 2008, for the tenth anniversary of the European System of Central Banks, 18 central banks in Europe. The ECB’s collection currently comprises 170 works by 75 artists and is shown in the ECB's three buildings. The ECB offers regular tours of the exhibitions and the collection, for example on the corporate collections weekend held by the state of Hesse. </p><p>Second, the ECB has held the ‘Cultural Days of the ECB’ since 2003. This event also takes place once a year, focuses on a particular Member State of the EU, and is organised in cooperation with the national central bank of the featured country. The programme provides a broad-ranging look at the cultural scene in the country and usually includes readings, concerts, films, theatre and dance performances, lectures and exhibitions. The events are mostly held outside the ECB and in cooperation with cultural institutions in Frankfurt – such as the Alte Oper, the Literaturhaus, the Deutsches Filmmuseum or the Mouson-Turm. In the last six years we have presented 198 events and 158 artists and ensembles, from promising newcomers and talented young artists, such as the Polish pianist Joanna Marcinkowska, to international greats such the Nobel prize-winning Hungarian author Imre Kertész or the Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki, who have helped to shape the cultural legacy of the twentieth century. </p><p>Our present art and cultural activities offer many examples of the unity in diversity that makes up Europe’s cultural identity. Let me give you only three examples of contemporary artists who illustrate very well the dense fabric of trans-frontier admiration and influence:</p><p>Our collection includes two works by the Austrian painter Hubert Scheibl, one of the best-known representatives of the new abstraction of the 1990s. His works allude to the romantic landscape painting which reached its apogee in nineteenth century Europe in the work of J.M.W. Turner and Caspar David Friedrich. Like these artists before him, Scheibl attempts to capture the spirit of a mystical, pantheistic experience of nature. He too makes reference to the idea of the sublime – to experiences which are too overwhelming for our senses to be able to take in, in their entirety – to a concept which, since the eighteenth century, has recurred, time and again, in the works of philosophers such as Edmund Burke, Immanuel Kant and Jean-François Lyotard. In the twentieth century the concept of the sublime primarily shaped European and American abstract expressionism, to which Scheibl's works – with their subtly nuanced fields of colour and subjective gestures – are related.</p><p>A second example would be the reading with literature Nobel laureate Imre Kertész, which was one of the high points of the Cultural Days dedicated to Hungary in 2005. The work of Kertész is embedded in the literary and intellectual history of the twentieth century like no other. At the centre of his works is the holocaust, which he sees as an indelible caesura in human history and which he puts at the heart of European history and modern existence. The descriptions of his protagonists are informed by the writings of Arthur Rimbaud and Jacques Lacan on split identities and multiple personalities. Rimbaud’s phrase “Je est un autre” was even used by Kertész as the basis for the title of his memoirs “I - Another: chronicle of a metamorphosis” which appeared in 1997. To earn a living under the communist regime in Hungary, Kertész translated works by Ludwig Wittgenstein, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Arthur Schnitzler, Joseph Roth and Elias Canetti, all of whom had a lasting influence on his thinking. In ‘Galley Diary’, a collection of observations, aphorisms and philosophical excursions which appeared in 1992, Kertész engages directly with great thinkers and poets of the twentieth century. In an internal dialogue with them he attempts to find the definitive answers to the holocaust and modernity, totalitarianism and freedom. Kertész cites as further inspirations popular literature such as penny-dreadfuls as well as Gustave Flaubert, with whom he shares a belief in the written word as the only truth. </p><p>Finally, I would like to look at the medium of film. In line with the European focus of the last Cultural Days, we showed Lars von Trier’s internationally award-winning 1991 film ‘Europa’. Von Trier is one of the best-known film-makers of the modern age. His most important sources of inspiration include literature and classics of European and American cinema history. He has a fascination for the dark and mysterious moods which mark the stories of Franz Kafka and Joseph Conrad, both of whom inform his ‘Europa’ in a very tangible way: the basic idea for the film was based on Kafka’s fragment “America“ (1911-14) and Conrad’s ‘Heart of Darkness’ (1899). In particular his early works – to which ‘Europa’ belongs – are clearly influenced by German expressionist film of the 1920s, Italian neo-realism of the 1940s and the contemporaneous ‘film noir’ which emerged in the United States. Thus, in ‘Europa’, von Trier’s images and stylistic renderings allude to the main representatives of these decades: Fritz Lang, Alfred Hitchcock and Roberto Rossellini.</p><p>Of course, there are many other revealing interrelationships within European culture to be discovered in our rich treasure trove of art exhibitions and Cultural Days programmes. We will remain committed to promoting cultural exchanges within Europe in the future and greatly look forward to the insights and experiences which the Romanian Cultural Days later this year will bring.</p><p>Have we exhausted the deep significance and the rich cultural identity of Europe once we have identified its sources and got the measure of its remarkable diversity, with its tight weave of influences, of relationships and of mutual admiration extending beyond national frontiers and linguistic barriers? Doesn’t European culture have another fundamental characteristic that makes it unique among the world’s cultures?</p><p>Jacques Derrida, the French philosopher, phrases the question this way in ‘ </p><p>L’autre Cap</p><p>’ </p><p>[</p><p>7</p><p>]</p><p>: “ On peut aimer à se rappeler qu’on est un intellectuel européen sans vouloir l’être de part en part. Se sentir européen entre autres choses, est-ce être plus ou moins européen ? Les deux sans doute (…). ”. In other words, “It’s nice to remind yourself that you are a European intellectual without wanting to be it through and through. To feel European among other things, does it mean being more, or less, European? Both, without doubt.”</p><p>It’s precisely because Europe has been gradually built on the basis of a sincere and deep-seated recognition of its cultural diversity that it aspires to be universal. Its cultural unity does not mean confinement, introspection or isolation inside a cultural ‘fortress’. An integral part of its culture is its admiration and insatiable curiosity about the abundance of cultures beyond its shores. </p><p>In the same text Derrida also says: “Comment assumer une responsabilité contradictoire qui nous inscrit dans une sorte de </p><p>double bind</p><p>: se faire les gardiens d’une idée de l’Europe, d’une différence de l’Europe qui consiste précisément à ne pas se fermer sur sa propre identité et à s’avancer exemplairement vers ce qui n’est pas elle, vers l’autre Cap (…)”. To put it in English: “We need to accept a conflicting responsibility which puts us in a kind of double bind: to become the guardians of a concept of Europe and of Europe’s distinctiveness, which consists not of closing oneself to one’s own identity but of moving in an exemplary way towards precisely what is not one’s own identity, towards the ‘Other Cape’.” </p><p>Europe’s deep aspiration to universality is expressed in a particularly ambitious way by Husserl in the same lecture in Vienna that I mentioned earlier. He talked about “a spirit of free criticism…of creating new, infinite ideals…”, and he added that “…there are some ideals that exist for individuals in their nations, and other ideals for the nations themselves. But, ultimately, there are also infinite ideals for the spreading ‘synthesis’ of nations, and in that synthesis each of these nations gives its best to its partner nations precisely by aiming for its own ideal task in a universal spirit”. </p><p>[</p><p>8</p><p>]</p><p>Is it not remarkable that, at a global level, UNESCO refers to cultural diversity using words similar to those used by the European Union itself to promote its cultural diversity? Let us compare the two texts. </p><p>Article 151 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which incorporates Article 128 of the Treaty of Maastricht, states: “The Community shall contribute to the </p><p>flowering of the cultures</p><p> of the Member States, while respecting their </p><p>national and regional diversity</p><p> and at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore”.</p><p>Compare this with part of the preamble to UNESCO’s Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions: the General Conference of UNESCO is “Conscious that </p><p>cultural diversity</p><p> forms a common heritage of humanity and </p><p>should be cherished and preserved</p><p> for the benefit of all”.</p><p>How does this diversity and universality, on which European unity is based, apply to the European Central Bank? Diversity is reflected, as I have already mentioned, by the fact that 27 nationalities are represented within the ECB, forming a single group and making a major contribution to our shared success. The ECB’s Governing Council itself represents a formidable example of diversity and unity. Together, we all fulfil our role of guiding Europe’s monetary team, the Eurosystem, consisting of the ECB and the 16 euro area national central banks, each with their own culture, language and history. And together with the 27 national central banks we make up the European System of Central Banks. We embrace this rich diversity, and it forms an integral part of our identity.</p><p>We also aspire to universality. We are open to the world and in close contact with institutions on other continents. We aim to play as active a role as possible in the international financial institutions and international informal groups to which we belong, we always support a multilateral approach. We greatly value our discussions with central banks on other continents, and particularly the regular meetings of the Eurosystem with central banks in Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean region. </p><p>As my final point, we are united because we have the eminent responsibility under the Maastricht Treaty as guardians of Europe’s single currency. Because Economic and Monetary Union is a magnificent undertaking that forms the basis of Europe’s prosperity and shared stability. And because the single currency is an emblem of Europe’s unity. The experience we have gained in this Economic and Monetary Union, based on the free will of the Member States, is exemplary in today’s globalised world that is rapidly integrating. It’s also why we are pleased to engage in close cooperation with institutions on other continents that are observing the ECB and the Eurosystem and thinking about the lessons they can draw from Europe’s unique experiences.</p><p>I would like to end by quoting the philosopher and writer Ernest Renan, who defined a nation’s identity as follows: “In the past, it was a heritage of glory and of regrets to share together; in the future, it will be the same programme to be realised…”. </p><p>[</p><p>9</p><p>]</p><p> Europe has more than its fair share of past glory and regrets, and possesses a deep cultural unity in its diversity. The single currency is an essential part of this ‘programme to be realised’. We shall continue to offer the euro as a unique and irreplaceable anchor of stability and trust. In the present very difficult circumstances it is more important than ever. Europe can rely on us to preserve that anchor.</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p><p>[</p><p>1</p><p>] </p><p>Goethe’s conversations with Eckermann (2 January 1824).</p><p>[</p><p>2</p><p>] </p><p>William Blake “From the annotations to Henry Boyd’s ‘A Translation of the Inferno of Dante Alighieri’, Oxford Classics.

Jean-Claude Trichet: Hearing at the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament,21-01-2009,European Central Bank,ECB,1808,"Madam President, Distinguished Members of the Commission Economic and Monetary, I welcome this first exchange of views with your Committee in 2009. This exchange takes place just days after the meeting of the Governing Council of 15 January devoted to monetary policy. Moreover, last Tuesday in Strasbourg during the plenary session dedicated to the ten years of the euro, I was pleased to note the support of your Parliament to the euro and the ECB. Today, as tradition dictates, I shall begin with an assessment of the economic and monetary situation, explaining the reasons behind our recent decisions on interest rates. Im Anschluss daran möchte ich einige Worte zum Preisausblick sagen, wie er sich im Eurogebiet darstellt. Und ich werde auf schließlich Fragen der internationalen Finanzarchitektur eingehen. Dieses Thema wird in den nächsten Monaten gewiss noch weiter year Bedeutung gewinnen.Since my previous appearance before the European Parliament on 8 December the economic outlook in the euro area has continued to weaken and inflation has declined further. In December 2008 the inflation rate stood at 1.6%. Moreover, inflationary pressures and inflationary risks have continued to diminish. Looking ahead, with the appropriate medium-term perspective for monetary policy and taking also into account our own policy decisions including the most recent one, we expect euro area inflation to remain in line with our definition of price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. Risks to price stability over the medium term are broadly balanced in the view of the Governing Council of the ECB. As regards economic developments, since September last year the financial turmoil has intensified and broadened. Tensions have increasingly spilled over from the financial sector into the real economy. Looking ahead, both global demand and euro area demand are likely to remain dampened for a protracted period. At the same time, declining inflation rates should support real disposable income in the period ahead, and the euro area economy should benefit from the broad and far-reaching policy measures that have been decided upon over recent weeks. However, this outlook remains surrounded by exceptionally high uncertainty. Overall, risks to economic growth remain clearly on the downside. They relate mainly to the potential for a stronger impact of the financial turmoil on the real economy as well as to concerns about the possible emergence and intensification of protectionist pressures and to possible adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances. To lay sound foundations for sustainable growth, all parties concerned should live up to their responsibilities. In this respect, it is crucial to maintain discipline and a medium-term perspective in macroeconomic policy-making. To pursue a stability-oriented and sustainable policy approach is the best way to preserve and enhance confidence. The significant measures being implemented by governments to address the financial turmoil should support trust in the financial system and ease constraints on credit supply to companies and households. Monetary trends in the euro area support the view that inflationary pressures are diminishing. Notably, the latest evidence confirms a moderating rate of monetary expansion. The Governing Council has repeated its commitment to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its definition of price stability of below, but close to, 2%. This supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. It is against this background that the Governing Council decided last week to reduce the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by a further 50 basis points to 2%, bringing the total reduction since 8 October 2008 to 225 basis points. Let me now look more closely at the medium-term outlook for price developments in the euro area, and in particular at the process of disinflation we are currently observing. I will thereby address the first topic proposed. It is essential here to draw a clear distinction between disinflation and deflation.Disinflation is a process of falling inflation rates. This process often stems from cost-saving developments on the supply side or terms of trade improvements. Such developments can sometimes go hand in hand with negative demand shocks as is the case at present. However, they are per se benign in nature. This is because they sustain real incomes. In the current context, we are witnessing a process of disinflation in the euro area, mainly as a result of a sharp fall in oil and commodity prices. To that extent it is therefore a welcome development. The spike in oil and commodity prices that began in 2007 and lasted until mid-2008 was both inflationary and contractionary. In consequence, the recent decline in these prices is both disinflationary and expansionary. By way of example, car fuel prices fell by 15.4% in December 2008 year on year. Their weight of almost 5% in the HICP basket means that this explains a significant part of the recent inflation decline. If such favourable supply-side developments are especially vigorous, disinflation can even temporarily lead to negative inflation rates. It is therefore very important in such circumstances to keep medium-term inflation expectations well-anchored.A deflationary process, by contrast, is a persistent and self-reinforcing decline in a very broad set of prices. This spiral is propagated by anticipation of prices declining further in the future. Such negative inflation expectations mean that investment and consumer demand is postponed, which would cause a second-round demand shortfall and put further downward pressures on prices. There is presently no threat of deflation. Indeed, the firm anchoring of inflation expectations – to which we are so fully committed – represents the strongest and most reassuring safeguard against any risk of a downward spiral of inflation and inflation expectations. From all these considerations you will understand that what we are currently witnessing is a process of disinflation, driven in particular by a sharp decline in commodity prices.Let me now turn to the second topic we selected, namely the international financial architecture. I consider that the fragility of the global financial system, by which I mean its lack of sufficient resilience that has been revealed in the course of the present episode of turbulences, is not acceptable. We must draw all the lessons of the crisis, without any complacency, considering that all the elements of the system must be significantly improved: the quality of risk management, liquidity management and the overall resilience of private institutions, the transparency of the financial markets, and the clarity of financial instruments. As already underlined on the occasion of previous hearings in front of you, this calls first for much more transparency, without any consideration of vested interests; second for much less short-termism in the decision-making processes, contrary to the most recent trends; and third for a systematic elimination of the procyclical aspects of our regulatory, prudential, accounting and taxation rules, which are amplifying considerably the fluctuations that are inherent in the functioning of market economies.The Financial Stability Forum (FSF) has identified the main avenues for such reforms. What we now need is strategic lucidity and, where appropriate, a great deal of political energy to counter considerable vested interests. The G20 and the IMF are and will be decisive in this respect. But a much better functioning of the financial sphere does not suffice. We also need sound macroeconomic policies that are sustainable in the medium and long run. In particular, we need to avoid the creation of the large domestic and external imbalances which are very much at the root of the present difficulties. An effective surveillance of macroeconomic policies of the major systemically important economies is of the essence. Only the IMF can perform this decisive function, provided its mandate is strengthened. In terms of institutional set-up, we need two major improvements:First, the international financial architecture requires a strengthening of the informal groupings, in particular the FSF and the G20. The FSF is unique in that it links all the authorities and institutions that have a systemic influence on financial markets, which are very largely decentralised and – for many of them – independent from the political sphere. The necessary enlargement of the FSF is key. Particularly important in a time of global crisis has been the new authority of the G20, which is a truly global informal grouping in comparison with the G7, which itself continues to be useful in a situation where the turbulence comes from the industrialised countries. Second, on top of the IMF’s strengthened surveillance mandate, the governance of the international financial institutions, particularly the IMF but also the World Bank, should become more effective and representative. In particular, a full representation of emerging market economies, commensurate with their importance in the global economy, is indispensable. ***By way of concluding my introductory remarks, I would like to stress two points. First, as regards euro area policies, persistent wage growth differentials, induced by structural inefficiencies or misaligned national policies, including wage-setting policies, might have adverse implications for the cost competitiveness of individual countries. National authorities have the responsibility to address competitiveness losses accumulated over recent years by implementing structural reforms and ensuring more moderate price and wage developments. Regarding fiscal policies, we welcome the European Council’s reconfirmation of its full commitment to sustainable public finances. The current economic situation calls for prudence with regard to the adoption of extensive fiscal stimulus measures, taking into account the particular fiscal situation in each country. As I have said before, countries can use all the room for manoeuvre provided by the Stability and Growth Pact but only the room for manoeuvre that is in the Pact. The significant fiscal loosening and the implied increase in government debt should in no case risk undermining public confidence in the sustainability of public finances, thereby detracting from the effectiveness of a fiscal stimulus. Second, I should like to turn briefly to financial supervision issues. The financial crisis has heightened the importance of addressing issues relating to financial supervision in a comprehensive and coordinated manner, both globally and at the European level.As regards the European level, the crisis has highlighted the need to analyse long-term solutions to the structure of supervision. To that end, the proposals which will be put forward by the High-Level Group chaired by Jacques de Larosière will represent an important contribution to the policy discussions. Considering the possible options and as underlined in particular by a number of Members of Parliament, Article 105(6) of the Treaty explicitly mentions the possibility for the Member States to decide to confer upon the ECB specific tasks in the domain of financial supervision. Reflections have started on the specific role that could be played by the ECB and its Governing Council should this provision of the Treaty be activated. At this stage the Governing Council has not yet taken a position on this topic. I will not fail to report to you the outcome of these reflections.Reproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.

Particularly important in a time of global crisis has been the new authority of the G20, which is a truly global informal grouping in comparison with the G7, which itself continues to be useful in a situation where the turbulence comes from the industrialised countries. </p><p>Second, on top of the IMF’s strengthened surveillance mandate, the governance of the international financial institutions, particularly the IMF but also the World Bank, should become more effective and representative. In particular, a full representation of emerging market economies, commensurate with their importance in the global economy, is indispensable. </p><p>***</p><p>By way of concluding my introductory remarks, I would like to stress two points. </p><p>First, as regards euro area policies, persistent wage growth differentials, induced by structural inefficiencies or misaligned national policies, including wage-setting policies, might have adverse implications for the cost competitiveness of individual countries. National authorities have the responsibility to address competitiveness losses accumulated over recent years by implementing structural reforms and ensuring more moderate price and wage developments. Regarding fiscal policies, we welcome the European Council’s reconfirmation of its full commitment to sustainable public finances. The current economic situation calls for prudence with regard to the adoption of extensive fiscal stimulus measures, taking into account the particular fiscal situation in each country. As I have said before, countries can use all the room for manoeuvre provided by the Stability and Growth Pact but only the room for manoeuvre that is in the Pact. The significant fiscal loosening and the implied increase in government debt should in no case risk undermining public confidence in the sustainability of public finances, thereby detracting from the effectiveness of a fiscal stimulus. </p><p>Second, I should like to turn briefly to financial supervision issues. The financial crisis has heightened the importance of addressing issues relating to financial supervision in a comprehensive and coordinated manner, both globally and at the European level.</p><p>As regards the European level, the crisis has highlighted the need to analyse long-term solutions to the structure of supervision. To that end, the proposals which will be put forward by the High-Level Group chaired by Jacques de Larosière will represent an important contribution to the policy discussions. </p><p>Considering the possible options and as underlined in particular by a number of Members of Parliament, Article 105(6) of the Treaty explicitly mentions the possibility for the Member States to decide to confer upon the ECB specific tasks in the domain of financial supervision. Reflections have started on the specific role that could be played by the ECB and its Governing Council should this provision of the Treaty be activated. At this stage the Governing Council has not yet taken a position on this topic. I will not fail to report to you the outcome of these reflections.</p><p>Reproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.</p><p> </p><p>Media contacts</p><p> </p>",entr
Jean-Claude Trichet: Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament,30-06-2011,European Central Bank,ECB,1646,"Dear Madam Chair,Dear Honourable Members,It is a pleasure to be back in Parliament and your Committee for our regular exchange of views. Once again, our meeting comes at a time when important decisions are being taken but also pending. Of particular concern is the conclusion of the legislative procedure on the economic governance package. I would first like to commend the continued efforts of the European Parliament and of the Council to reconcile their positions on the economic governance package. The Board of Governors would have liked the European Council on 24 June to make an opening gesture to the European Parliament on this issue. The main point of disagreement - the extension of reversed qualified majority in the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact - is of key importance. Eurozone urgently needs a stronger economic governance framework and ambitious. The current crisis demonstrates, conclusively, if any were needed, the negative consequences of unhealthy fiscal and economic policies.Therefore it is essential to reach an ambitious agreement. In the current situation, an agreement would be particularly welcome in order to make clear that the right lessons are learned from the crisis.Let me now turn to the economic and monetary developments in the euro area since our previous meeting in March, as well as the two topics you have asked me to focus on, namely fiscal consolidation and monetary policy on the one hand, and sovereign debt developments on the other. Let me first turn to the economic and monetary developments in the euro area since our previous meeting in March. In this context, let me also note that we are now in the purdah period, as the next Governing Council meeting will take place on 7 July. This means that nothing in what I will say is intended or should be interpreted in any respect in terms of future monetary policy.Incoming information since I last spoke to you has confirmed a positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area. We expect the continued expansion of the world economy and domestic demand from the private sector as the main driver of economic growth in the euro area. The latest Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections are in line with this assessment. They foresee the economy to grow between 1.5% and 2.3% for 2011 and between 0.6% and 2.8% for 2012. In our view, the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced in a context of elevated uncertainty. As regards price developments, we are observing continued upward pressure on prices, especially in the earlier stages of the production process. Inflation in the euro area stood at 2.7% in May, after 2.8% in April. The inflation rates seen over the past few months largely reflect higher energy and commodity prices. Going forward, inflation is likely to stay clearly above 2% over the months ahead, mainly due to energy and commodity prices. The Eurosystem staff projections indicate inflation ranging between 2.5% and 2.7% for 2011, and between 1.1 and 2.3% for 2012. It is of paramount importance that the current relatively high inflation rates do not translate into second-round effects, via higher wages and price-setting, and thereby do not lead to broad-based inflationary pressures. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments continue to be on the upside. Notably, energy prices could increase faster than currently expected, and indirect taxes and administered prices might be raised faster with a view to reducing budget deficits. In addition, increasing capacity utilisation may exert stronger upward pressure on domestic prices. As regards our monetary analysis, we see the underlying pace of monetary expansion gradually recovering. At the same time, monetary liquidity remains ample. This has the potential to accommodate price pressures.As you are aware, we are strongly determined to secure that inflation expectations remain firmly in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.Against this background the Governing Council raised the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points in April, in order to adjust the very accommodative monetary policy stance in the light of upside risks to price stability. Since then we have kept the rates unchanged. At the same time, as I said in the press conference after the last Governing Council, we see the monetary policy stance as still accommodative and risks to price stability on the upside. Accordingly, I said that we are in a state of strong vigilance and that we stand ready to act in a firm and timely manner to avoid that recent price developments give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. As regards our non-standard measures, the Governing Council earlier this month decided to maintain its fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment in its refinancing operations up to the third quarter of 2011. Let me now turn to the topic of fiscal consolidation and monetary policy. In a monetary union, the central bank when setting interest rates has to take an area-wide perspective. In the same manner the US Federal Reserve do not and cannot tailor its interest rate to the specific economic conditions in individual US states. Setting the policy rate with a clear focus on the euro area as a whole does not, however, mean ignoring the diversity in financial conditions. Since the financial crisis erupted, the ECB has adopted a number of non-standard measures to foster as much as possible a smooth functioning of the monetary policy transmission throughout the euro area.The current major challenges faced by a few euro area countries are mainly the result of some governments not conducting sound policies and not implementing reforms that would benefit their citizens and the European public as a whole. It is essential that euro area countries fully assume the responsibilities at the national level that derive from their participation in the euro area. Past experiences of fiscal consolidation episodes demonstrate the long-term benefits of reducing sizeable fiscal imbalances. There are at least three reasons why well-designed fiscal consolidation is beneficial in the current circumstances. Accompanied by appropriate structural reforms, it promotes long-term growth. For those economies with large fiscal imbalances, it is indispensable to bolster confidence. And for all economies it helps create buffers that would be essential to deal with unforeseen events. It is also for this reason that the ongoing negotiations on the governance package should produce an ambitious outcome. I have been emphasising time and again why we are very much in agreement with the European Parliament on this – the need for a quantum leap in economic governance through the currently discussed legislative package. At this stage, I would like to recall two points:First, we should not be content with a stronger Stability and Growth Pact only at the later stages of an excessive deficit procedure. We need to halt any fiscal excesses early on and correct them. The obvious way is a higher degree of automaticity early on in the procedures, that is, more reverse qualified majority voting in the preventive arm of the Pact; and therefore the prospect of more timely sanctions, possibly of a reputational nature.Second, we would benefit considerably from an equally ambitious macroeconomic imbalances framework that detects imbalances early on, through a well focused and rigorously applied scoreboard; and then corrects them, again in a timely fashion. Here, we need to focus on those countries that ultimately pose a risk to other euro area countries through in particular persistent and excessive competitiveness losses.Let me now turn to the current sovereign debt developments. As you know, at the euro area level, we see that fiscal consolidation in many countries is ongoing, and will, according to the European Commission’s Spring 2011 Forecast, bring the euro area general government deficit down to 3.5% by 2012. This is an encouraging prospect, especially by international comparison. Also for the current year the euro area fiscal deficit is somewhat less than half of that of the US and Japan. However, selected euro area countries are currently still facing high debt and deficit levels.The ECB has always made clear that the best way to cope with the current sovereign debt positions is a determined and disciplined implementation of agreed fiscal consolidation paths and the structural reform agenda to promote medium term growth. For the euro area countries under an EU/IMF programme, a determined implementation of those programmes is of utmost importance to get back to a sound economic situation. This call has been echoed by the European Council, which at its recent meeting urged the national authorities, especially but not only in Greece, to continue implementing rigorously and with the highest resolve the necessary adjustment efforts to put the country on a sustainable path. To that end, national unity and cross-party consensus are essential. As to the possibility of debt action, let me recall what I have said many times on this matter, on behalf of the Governing Council: We strongly advise against all concepts that are not purely voluntary or that have elements of compulsion. We call for the avoidance of any credit events and selection default or default. Let me add that I am from time to time surprised by the narrow view of private sector involvement that is generally taken in the present debate. We should not forget that private capital is also mobilised when embarking on privatisation. Privatisation is a good way of mobilising private capital and is something that we have encouraged considerably, particularly in the case of Greece. It is an effective way of mobilising private capital and has positive consequences not only on the financing of the country, but also in terms of positive structural effects on growth and employment. Finally, the private sector involvement that everybody is aiming at is to go back as soon as possible to private sector market financing.Thank you for your attention.Reproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.

Jean-Claude Trichet: The ECB’s response to the crisis,26-05-2011,European Central Bank,ECB,2389,"Dear Sir or Madam,I am delighted to be here today. Thank you very much for the invitation.I am particularly pleased to such an important issue - to speak - the European response to the economic and financial crisis.* * *As you know, is the primary mandate of the ECB to ensure price stability in the euro area. So it has been posted by the European leaders in the treaties to the European Union 1992nd And accordingly, the Governing Council aims at a medium-term inflation rate of below, but close to 2%.The ECB has become this mandate justice in the past twelve years. Annual inflation over the period was 1.97% in the euro area. In Germany it was 1.5% in 1999 even significantly less. For Germany, this is the best result for a similar period in 50 years with the Deutsche Mark. ""As strong as the mark"" should be the euro - and strong as the Mark he has become.It is important to understand the significance of this achievement. Over the past 12 years, the ECB has faced many challenges in the pursuit of our goal of price stability. They include the bursting of the internet bubble, the aftermath of 11 September 2001, sharp volatility in commodity prices and of course the worst financial crisis since World War II. Today I would like to focus specifically on our response to the crisis – and on the programmes of reform of financial regulation and economic governance on which the euro area and the European Union as a whole are engaged. While there is no doubt of the scale of the challenge that the crisis has posed for all advanced economies, including the US and Japan, there is also no doubt that we have taken significant measures in responding to that challenge. But much more needs to be done.Let me begin with financial regulation. The crisis calls for a comprehensive agenda of reform of virtually every aspect of the global financial system. We must control the forces that led the system to become absorbed with itself and ensure instead that it serves the real economy. And we must be assured that the financial system provides a sustainable contribution to economic growth. At this point, we have achieved a blueprint of more stringent bank regulations, which includes more loss-absorbing capital, better risk coverage and limitations on undue leverage. Countercyclical capital buffers are intended to lower pro-cyclicality. The oversight of financial institutions, financial markets and market infrastructure are being strengthened, and the organisational structure of financial supervision is being overhauled. But much remains to be done. The most important aspect is implementation of these reforms. Moreover, the issue of systemically important financial institutions still requires decisions, and oversight of financial markets must be strengthened. We cannot afford the consequences of limited transparency and excessive influence of dominant players and oligopolistic market structures.The new European System of Financial Supervision is an important step forward. The three new European Authorities – for banking, for insurance and occupational pensions, and for securities and markets – are strengthening our focus on interlinkages and spillovers within the EU’s financial system. And the European Systemic Risk Board is developing the tools it needs to issue warnings and make recommendations for action on potential future sources of systemic risk.Inattention to financial risk was the prime cause of the crisis. Inattention to macroeconomic risk – and the many ways in which such risk interacts with fragile fiscal structures – prepared the ground for the budgetary troubles that some euro area countries are facing today. This brings me to reform of economic governance.The EU is about to introduce surveillance focused on imbalances and divergences in competitiveness across the euro area. This is long overdue. Since 2005 within the Eurogroup and – shortly thereafter – publicly, the ECB has warned that such divergences create considerable risks and must be corrected. If fully implemented, macroeconomic surveillance will make a strong contribution to the smooth functioning of EMU. It will compel Member States to take measures to counter emerging macroeconomic imbalances at an early stage, before they become a drag on their macroeconomic prospects and potentially escalate to systemic proportions. Governments had agreed on the Stability and Growth Pact to prevent a debt crisis. But in 2005 the Member States agreed on a reform of the Pact. At the request of Germany and France, more discretion and flexibility was added to the surveillance procedures. This turned out to be to the detriment of the Pact. It weakened the Pact considerably.At that time, the ECB expressed serious concerns about the negative effect of these reforms on the functioning of EMU. It is important that Member States have acknowledged this mistake and intend to strengthen the Pact again. The new focus on fiscal sustainability and reducing government debt levels, backed by more effective sanctions, certainly goes in the right direction.The euro is unique among international currencies. It is the only major currency that is issued not by a single sovereign state but by a union of states. Fiscal policies remain largely the competence of national governments and reflect national political preferences. Monetary policy is inherently indivisible in a monetary union, and in the euro area it is thus conducted at the European level.The current crisis is not a crisis of the euro. Neither is it a crisis of monetary union. Rather, it is a crisis of the economic policies in some Member States and a crisis of mutual surveillance. If we recall that EMU stands for Economic and Monetary Union, it is not the monetary pillar of EMU that is under scrutiny at present, but the economic pillar. Speaking in terms of letters, the “E” and not the “M” in EMU is giving cause for concern. Our economic governance framework has not been sufficient to ensure sound policies are conducted in all Member States. The Treaty clearly specifies that Member States have committed to economic policies geared to contributing to the objectives of the Union, one of which is a stable single currency. They have yet to live up to this commitment fully.The Governing Council of the ECB is concerned that the reforms to economic governance currently under discussion are a step in the right direction but do not go far enough to address the structural weaknesses of fiscal and broader macroeconomic governance in the euro area. At the very least, we require more automaticity in the sanctioning mechanisms. Euro area countries that are breaching our common rules should be called to account, with as little room for discretion and flexibility as possible. This implies less room for halting or suspending procedures and stricter deadlines.Behind this we argue in favour of stronger sanctions to encourage compliance. This would require, on the one hand, a wider range of financial and non-financial measures, and on the other hand, less discretion to reduce or suspend them. Such a strengthening would improve effectiveness and set the right incentives. At the same time, more ambitious policy requirements would better match the current reality of the euro area. This means having ambitious benchmarks when establishing an excessive deficit and when setting the adjustment path towards a “safe” budgetary position. It is very important for macroeconomic surveillance to have a clear focus on the countries with the greatest vulnerabilities. Anchoring these new rules at the national level would forcefully anchor them in national legislation. Binding commitments by Member States to implement strong national budgetary frameworks are key to ensuring national ownership. Finally, further improvements in the production of fiscal statistics are in our view warranted.These are all areas in which the ECB is presenting arguments. In the end, these matters are decided by the Council and the Parliament, and they have therefore the key responsibility in shaping the new framework.Let me now turn to my final topic – the “M” in EMU, which is the direct responsibility of the ECB. During the crisis, along with central banks around the world, the ECB has had to operate in uncharted waters. The ECB demonstrated its alertness from the very first day. When the problems in financial markets first became apparent on 9 August 2007, we were the first central bank to respond, acting within hours.While the crisis required fast and unprecedented action we have never lost sight of our primary objective: to maintain price stability over the medium term for the 331 million citizens of the euro area. All – and I emphasise all – our monetary policy decisions during the past twelve and a half years have aimed at delivering on that commitment.As you know, in normal times central banks mainly influence the economy and inflation through the setting of short-term interest rates. In practice, identifying risks to price stability at an early stage is far from trivial. To accomplish this task the ECB relies on a robust monetary policy strategy that draws on several sources of information. Economic analysis allows us to synthesise information on short-term inflationary pressures from a multitude of economic indicators. Monetary analysis allows us to cross-check this information with information on medium-term inflationary pressures extracted from monetary and financial indicators. It is on this basis that we decide on the appropriate monetary policy stance and adjust interest rates accordingly. Our positive track record has endorsed our approach. Over the past twelve and a half years we have built a strong reputation for setting interest rates as appropriate to maintain price stability. Our decisions in the face of political pressure have demonstrated our fierce independence. We refused to decrease rates at the beginning of 2004 when Germany, France and Italy, in particular, asked us to do so. We did not hesitate to raise interest rates in December 2005. At that point, ten euro area governments out of 12 and many international observers pressured us to keep rates on hold. The IMF, for example, was emphasising the risks that tightening – after a prolonged period of policy accommodation – could pose for the recovery. We tightened policy despite these warnings, and we were vindicated – by the IMF’s own admission. We also did not hesitate to raise interest rates in July 2008. Then, our analysis indicated that past oil price increases threatened to create second-round effects on wages and prices.After the intensification of the crisis in mid-September 2008, as inflationary pressures receded, in full consistency with our mandate, we decided to reduce our policy interest rate rapidly between October 2008 and May 2009, from 4.25% to 1%. We reduced the interest rate to a level and at a pace that has not been experienced in the countries of the euro area at any time in recent history. With the benefit of hindsight, the interest rate decisions we took during the crisis have proved successful. Over the past four years we have maintained a very solid anchoring of inflation expectations. Our determination to preserve price stability in the medium term has allowed us to avoid the materialisation of the risk of inflation as well as of the risk of deflation. In most recent months, with the overall recovery more firmly established, we have witnessed the emergence of upside risks to the medium-term outlook for price stability. Once more, strong increases in oil and other commodity prices have had a strong impact on headline inflation. Once more, we have to avoid commodity price increases becoming entrenched in longer-term inflation expectations, which could have second-round effects on wages and prices. It is against this background that the Governing Council decided to raise interest rates in April. And I would like to emphasise that this decision was unanimous. The Governing Council is united by a common purpose. We are carefully monitoring the situation and we stand ready to do whatever is necessary to fulfil our mandate – just as we have done over the past twelve and a half years.This logic applies not only to our policy interest rate but also to the other measures we have adopted in response to the crisis. When the crisis hit, dysfunctional financial markets threatened our ability to steer the outlook for price stability with our standard interest rate instrument. In response, we adopted a number of non-standard measures to ensure that our interest rate decisions were transmitted to the broader economy, despite the problems in the financial sector and financial markets. In particular, the aim has been to enable banks – at any level of the monetary policy interest rate – to continue lending to household and firms. Let me emphasise that our non-standard measures do not in any way impinge on our capacity to tighten our monetary policy stance in response to inflationary pressures. There is a clear separation principle between our non-standard measures and our interest rate policy. Interest rate policy depends on the outlook for price stability. The use of non-standard measures depends on the functioning of the monetary policy transmission and must be commensurate with the level of malfunctioning or disruption of money and financial markets and segments of markets. This separation principle is strictly applied. To give you a recent example, the Governing Council decided in March and April both that it was now time to increase interest rates and, at the same time, that it was appropriate to maintain in the second quarter the full allotment at fixed price refinancing on a 3 month duration.This is my final point. The crisis has put the euro area a major challenge. But we have accepted this challenge. The euro has proved an anchor of stability in a stormy sea. Of all - I repeat, all - benefited the euro area countries.For all that, we should not overlook the fact that the euro area has made significant progress as a whole over the past twelve years. Economic momentum in the euro area has followed after those in the United States in nothing. In both regions, the per capita income has increased by about 1% on an annual average. Here, the euro area has a lot more jobs created than the United States. In the euro area as a whole, employment in the past twelve years has increased by more than 14 million. In the United States, the increase was 8 million. And all that we have achieved in the context of inflation expectations in the euro area, which are anchored at a low level. This is a more than respectable record.I can assure you that the European Central Bank will also continue its part to the smooth functioning of economic and monetary union: we are no ifs and buts price stability secure.

attent reproduct permit provid sourc acknowledg media contact,"<p>Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,</p><p>ich freue mich sehr, heute hier zu sein. Vielen herzlichen Dank für die Einladung. </p><p>Ich freue mich besonders, zu einem so wichtigen Thema – der europäischen Antwort auf die Wirtschafts- und Finanzkrise – zu sprechen.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Wie Sie wissen, ist das primäre Mandat der EZB, für Preisstabilität im Eurogebiet zu sorgen. So ist es von den Europäischen Staats- und Regierungschefs in den Verträgen zur Europäischen Union 1992 festgeschrieben worden. Und dementsprechend strebt der EZB-Rat eine mittelfristige Inflationsrate von unter, aber nahe bei 2% an.</p><p>Die EZB ist diesem Mandat in den vergangenen zwölf Jahren gerecht geworden. Die jährliche Teuerungsrate betrug über diesen Zeitraum im Eurogebiet 1.97%. In Deutschland lag sie mit 1.5% seit 1999 sogar noch deutlich darunter. Für Deutschland ist dies das beste Ergebnis über einen vergleichbaren Zeitraum seit 50 Jahren mit der D-Mark. „Stark wie die Mark“ sollte der Euro sein – und stark wie die Mark ist er geworden. </p><p>It is important to understand the significance of this achievement. Over the past 12 years, the ECB has faced many challenges in the pursuit of our goal of price stability. They include the bursting of the internet bubble, the aftermath of 11 September 2001, sharp volatility in commodity prices and of course the worst financial crisis since World War II. </p><p>Today I would like to focus specifically on our response to the crisis – and on the programmes of reform of financial regulation and economic governance on which the euro area and the European Union as a whole are engaged. </p><p>While there is no doubt of the scale of the challenge that the crisis has posed for all advanced economies, including the US and Japan, there is also no doubt that we have taken significant measures in responding to that challenge. But much more needs to be done.</p><p>Let me begin with financial regulation. The crisis calls for a comprehensive agenda of reform of virtually every aspect of the global financial system. We must control the forces that led the system to become absorbed with itself and ensure instead that it serves the real economy. And we must be assured that the financial system provides a sustainable contribution to economic growth. </p><p>At this point, we have achieved a blueprint of more stringent bank regulations, which includes more loss-absorbing capital, better risk coverage and limitations on undue leverage. Countercyclical capital buffers are intended to lower pro-cyclicality. </p><p>The oversight of financial institutions, financial markets and market infrastructure are being strengthened, and the organisational structure of financial supervision is being overhauled. </p><p>But much remains to be done. The most important aspect is implementation of these reforms. Moreover, the issue of systemically important financial institutions still requires decisions, and oversight of financial markets must be strengthened. We cannot afford the consequences of limited transparency and excessive influence of dominant players and oligopolistic market structures.</p><p>The new European System of Financial Supervision is an important step forward. The three new European Authorities – for banking, for insurance and occupational pensions, and for securities and markets – are strengthening our focus on interlinkages and spillovers within the EU’s financial system. And the European Systemic Risk Board is developing the tools it needs to issue warnings and make recommendations for action on potential future sources of systemic risk.</p><p>Inattention to financial risk was the prime cause of the crisis. Inattention to macroeconomic risk – and the many ways in which such risk interacts with fragile fiscal structures – prepared the ground for the budgetary troubles that some euro area countries are facing today. This brings me to reform of economic governance.</p><p>The EU is about to introduce surveillance focused on imbalances and divergences in competitiveness across the euro area. This is long overdue. Since 2005 within the Eurogroup and – shortly thereafter – publicly, the ECB has warned that such divergences create considerable risks and must be corrected. </p><p>If fully implemented, macroeconomic surveillance will make a strong contribution to the smooth functioning of EMU. It will compel Member States to take measures to counter emerging macroeconomic imbalances at an early stage, before they become a drag on their macroeconomic prospects and potentially escalate to systemic proportions. </p><p>Governments had agreed on the Stability and Growth Pact to prevent a debt crisis. But in 2005 the Member States agreed on a reform of the Pact. At the request of Germany and France, more discretion and flexibility was added to the surveillance procedures. This turned out to be to the detriment of the Pact. It weakened the Pact considerably.</p><p>At that time, the ECB expressed serious concerns about the negative effect of these reforms on the functioning of EMU. </p><p>It is important that Member States have acknowledged this mistake and intend to strengthen the Pact again. The new focus on fiscal sustainability and reducing government debt levels, backed by more effective sanctions, certainly goes in the right direction.</p><p>The euro is unique among international currencies. It is the only major currency that is issued not by a single sovereign state but by a union of states. Fiscal policies remain largely the competence of national governments and reflect national political preferences. Monetary policy is inherently indivisible in a monetary union, and in the euro area it is thus conducted at the European level.</p><p>The current crisis is not a crisis of the euro. Neither is it a crisis of monetary union. Rather, it is a crisis of the economic policies in some Member States and a crisis of mutual surveillance. If we recall that EMU stands for Economic and Monetary Union, it is not the monetary pillar of EMU that is under scrutiny at present, but the economic pillar. Speaking in terms of letters, the “E” and not the “M” in EMU is giving cause for concern. </p><p>Our economic governance framework has not been sufficient to ensure sound policies are conducted in all Member States. The Treaty clearly specifies that Member States have committed to economic policies geared to contributing to the objectives of the Union, one of which is a stable single currency. They have yet to live up to this commitment fully.</p><p>The Governing Council of the ECB is concerned that the reforms to economic governance currently under discussion are a step in the right direction but do not go far enough to address the structural weaknesses of fiscal and broader macroeconomic governance in the euro area. At the very least, we require more automaticity in the sanctioning mechanisms. Euro area countries that are breaching our common rules should be called to account, with as little room for discretion and flexibility as possible. This implies less room for halting or suspending procedures and stricter deadlines.</p><p>Behind this we argue in favour of stronger sanctions to encourage compliance. This would require, on the one hand, a wider range of financial and non-financial measures, and on the other hand, less discretion to reduce or suspend them. Such a strengthening would improve effectiveness and set the right incentives. </p><p>At the same time, more ambitious policy requirements would better match the current reality of the euro area. This means having ambitious benchmarks when establishing an excessive deficit and when setting the adjustment path towards a “safe” budgetary position. It is very important for macroeconomic surveillance to have a clear focus on the countries with the greatest vulnerabilities. </p><p>Anchoring these new rules at the national level would forcefully anchor them in national legislation. Binding commitments by Member States to implement strong national budgetary frameworks are key to ensuring national ownership. Finally, further improvements in the production of fiscal statistics are in our view warranted.</p><p>These are all areas in which the ECB is presenting arguments. In the end, these matters are decided by the Council and the Parliament, and they have therefore the key responsibility in shaping the new framework.</p><p>Let me now turn to my final topic – the “M” in EMU, which is the direct responsibility of the ECB. During the crisis, along with central banks around the world, the ECB has had to operate in uncharted waters. </p><p>The ECB demonstrated its alertness from the very first day. When the problems in financial markets first became apparent on 9 August 2007, we were the first central bank to respond, acting within hours.</p><p>While the crisis required fast and unprecedented action we have never lost sight of our primary objective: to maintain price stability over the medium term for the 331 million citizens of the euro area. All – and I emphasise </p><p>all</p><p> – our monetary policy decisions during the past twelve and a half years have aimed at delivering on that commitment.</p><p>As you know, in normal times central banks mainly influence the economy and inflation through the setting of short-term interest rates. </p><p>In practice, identifying risks to price stability at an early stage is far from trivial. To accomplish this task the ECB relies on a robust monetary policy strategy that draws on several sources of information. Economic analysis allows us to synthesise information on short-term inflationary pressures from a multitude of economic indicators. Monetary analysis allows us to cross-check this information with information on medium-term inflationary pressures extracted from monetary and financial indicators. It is on this basis that we decide on the appropriate monetary policy stance and adjust interest rates accordingly. </p><p>Our positive track record has endorsed our approach. Over the past twelve and a half years we have built a strong reputation for setting interest rates as appropriate to maintain price stability. </p><p>Our decisions in the face of political pressure have demonstrated our fierce independence. We refused to decrease rates at the beginning of 2004 when Germany, France and Italy, in particular, asked us to do so. We did not hesitate to raise interest rates in December 2005. At that point, ten euro area governments out of 12 and many international observers pressured us to keep rates on hold. </p><p>The IMF, for example, was emphasising the risks that tightening – after a prolonged period of policy accommodation – could pose for the recovery.

Jean-Claude Trichet: Short Address in honour of Axel Weber,02-05-2011,European Central Bank,ECB,1298,"Ladies and gentlemen,I am delighted to be with you today. I want to thank on behalf of the Governing Council Axel Weber for his contribution over the past seven years and welcome Jens Weidmann as a new councilor.The Eurosystem is a large team, and it is a cohesive one, with a variety of perspectives linked by a common purpose. The Eurosystem is also a very successful team. Ever since the introduction of the euro we have been fully faithful to our mandate of maintaining price stability over the medium term, defined as medium-term inflation at “below, but close to 2%”. As you know, the average annual inflation rate in the euro area over the past twelve years has been 1.97%. This is a remarkable achievement, also considering that the economic environment during those 12 years can hardly be described as benign. The beginnings were marked by a severe oil price shock, which compounded the cost pressure and inflation implications of a secular decline in European productivity trends. Due to these adverse supply side adjustments, the bursting of the dot-com bubble brought a downswing with no disinflation. Later, over the recovery that followed – Axel remembers – there was no time or disposition within the Governing Council for complacency, as we were all too concerned about insistent signs of excessive credit market euphoria, about – once more – strong pressures on commodity and food prices and – ultimately – about the global imbalances that such a combination of forces were causing worldwide. Axel became member of the Governing Council in 2004, at a time when many voices, including in the executive branches and in the international financial institutions were calling for looser monetary policy. We rightly resisted these calls based on our own assessment of the risks to price stability. Back then and throughout the past seven years Axel has made influential contributions to the discussions shaping the view of the Governing Council on the appropriate monetary policy stance.The fact that we have been able to solidly anchor inflation expectations in the euro area at a level consistent with price stability throughout all these phases has bolstered our credibility. The Eurosystem clearly stands in the tradition of best practice in central banking – as exemplified by the Bundesbank prior to the introduction of the euro. The Eurosystem’s two-pillar monetary policy strategy inherited the concept of the Bundesbank monetary pillar – which my own previous institution, the Banque de France had also chosen in January 1994 as soon as it became independent. The Eurosystem’s two pillar strategy is built on the conviction that, in the medium to long term, inflation is a monetary phenomenon and that independent central banks have the strategy and the instruments to achieve price stability. The Eurosystem’s track record proves that this important insight translates one for one to the monetary union context.I would like to take this opportunity to also express my gratitude, not only to Axel Weber but also to all Bundesbank staff, for the commitment shown on a daily basis during the past twelve years and in particular during the financial crisis. The Governing Council of the ECB knows and highly appreciates the crucial contribution of national central banks to the smooth functioning of monetary union. The financial crisis has made more visible to a broader public the essential tasks that national central banks carry out day by day within the Eurosystem. For the sake of brevity allow me to focus here on two such activities, and I am fully aware that there are many other tasks that equally deserve our full recognition. On both dimensions, the Eurosystem benefited enormously from the Bundesbank’s dedication to our common cause, and on both dimensions the Bundesbank contribution found in Axel its voice.The first task is financial supervision, the importance of which cannot be underestimated. For one thing, the information gathered in supervision has been particularly useful in the preparation of monetary policy decisions during the financial crisis. This has been especially true when and since the Governing Council of the ECB decided to introduce non-standard monetary policy measures to ensure the proper transmission of the monetary policy stance. The information also helps the Governing Council of the ECB assess the interconnectedness of national financial systems and vulnerabilities threatening financial stability in the euro area as a whole.In this context the Bundesbank has done a crucial job in containing the fallout from the financial crisis. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers immediate and determined action was crucial to avoid a meltdown of the financial system in Germany and the other euro area countries. The Bundesbank under the leadership of Axel offered the best possible diagnosis to protect the stability of the German banking sector at the height of the crisis. Nonetheless, the financial crisis has revealed serious weaknesses in existing supervisory arrangements both at the national and euro area level. In response to these shortcomings, the EU among other initiatives has created the macro-prudential European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) in which the Eurosystem is very actively involved. Axel has generously devoted his time to the Steering Committee of the ESRB as he has done for the Financial Stability Board at the international level. The second task for which the Eurosystem has to rely critically on the support of the national central banks is the implementation of monetary policy. This role comprises the conduct of monetary policy operations, the design and operation of payment systems and the provision of banknotes and coins. At several points in time the efficient and effective functioning of the infrastructure has been absolutely essential to the success of the euro. This was true in the very beginnings in 1999, it was true at the moment of the cash changeover in 2002 and it has been true most recently during the financial crisis. The Eurosystem infrastructure has been exposed to a formidable stress test and it has proved its robustness throughout.Again, Bundesbank expertise proved immensely valuable, for example in the design of our new payment system TARGET2 but also in the design of our non-standard monetary policy measures, most notably our covered bonds purchase programme, which as you know are a German innovation dating back to the time of Friedrich des Großen. Their success over hundreds of years shows that asset-backed securities need not be toxic. Pfandbriefe are a prime example of finance at the service of people’s well-being. Therefore the Governing Council in May 2009 decided to lend its support to this asset class, following Axel’s advice.This is my final point. Based of the success of the euro only on luck? Allow me to answer with a quote that is Axel Weber attributed in a different context: ""Not luck - Can""[1]""And perseverance"" I would add in our context. The euro system is very well equipped for the future.Dear Axel, I wish you all the best for your future! Lieber Jens, as you know, we are still living in a very demanding environment. The crisis is not over. The responsibilities of the private sector and public authorities are as important as ever during the last three years. The Eurosystem has kept and will keep its sense of direction, strictly separating the standard measures, designed to deliver price stability, from the non-standard measures, designed to help restore a more correct monetary policy transmission mechanism. We shall never forget that we are issuing a single currency for 17 sovereign countries and 331 million citizens. This is a situation which has no equivalent in the world.

Ich möchte im Namen des EZB-Rats Axel Weber für seinen Beitrag über die vergangenen sieben Jahren danken und Jens Weidmann als neues Ratsmitglied begrüßen. </p><p>The Eurosystem is a large team, and it is a cohesive one, with a variety of perspectives linked by a common purpose. The Eurosystem is also a very successful team. Ever since the introduction of the euro we have been fully faithful to our mandate of maintaining price stability over the medium term, defined as medium-term inflation at “below, but close to 2%”. </p><p>As you know, the average annual inflation rate in the euro area over the past twelve years has been 1.97%. </p><p>This is a remarkable achievement, also considering that the economic environment during those 12 years can hardly be described as benign. The beginnings were marked by a severe oil price shock, which compounded the cost pressure and inflation implications of a secular decline in European productivity trends. Due to these adverse supply side adjustments, the bursting of the dot-com bubble brought a downswing with no disinflation. Later, over the recovery that followed – Axel remembers – there was no time or disposition within the Governing Council for complacency, as we were all too concerned about insistent signs of excessive credit market euphoria, about – once more – strong pressures on commodity and food prices and – ultimately – about the global imbalances that such a combination of forces were causing worldwide. Axel became member of the Governing Council in 2004, at a time when many voices, including in the executive branches and in the international financial institutions were calling for looser monetary policy. We rightly resisted these calls based on our own assessment of the risks to price stability. Back then and throughout the past seven years Axel has made influential contributions to the discussions shaping the view of the Governing Council on the appropriate monetary policy stance.</p><p>The fact that we have been able to solidly anchor inflation expectations in the euro area at a level consistent with price stability throughout all these phases has bolstered our credibility. The Eurosystem clearly stands in the tradition of best practice in central banking – as exemplified by the Bundesbank prior to the introduction of the euro. The Eurosystem’s two-pillar monetary policy strategy inherited the concept of the Bundesbank monetary pillar – which my own previous institution, the Banque de France had also chosen in January 1994 as soon as it became independent. The Eurosystem’s two pillar strategy is built on the conviction that, in the medium to long term, inflation is a monetary phenomenon and that independent central banks have the strategy and the instruments to achieve price stability. The Eurosystem’s track record proves that this important insight translates one for one to the monetary union context.</p><p>I would like to take this opportunity to also express my gratitude, not only to Axel Weber but also to all Bundesbank staff, for the commitment shown on a daily basis during the past twelve years and in particular during the financial crisis. The Governing Council of the ECB knows and highly appreciates the crucial contribution of national central banks to the smooth functioning of monetary union. The financial crisis has made more visible to a broader public the essential tasks that national central banks carry out day by day within the Eurosystem. </p><p>For the sake of brevity allow me to focus here on two such activities, and I am fully aware that there are many other tasks that equally deserve our full recognition. On both dimensions, the Eurosystem benefited enormously from the Bundesbank’s dedication to our common cause, and on both dimensions the Bundesbank contribution found in Axel its voice.</p><p>The first task is financial supervision, the importance of which cannot be underestimated. For one thing, the information gathered in supervision has been particularly useful in the preparation of monetary policy decisions during the financial crisis. This has been especially true when and since the Governing Council of the ECB decided to introduce non-standard monetary policy measures to ensure the proper transmission of the monetary policy stance. The information also helps the Governing Council of the ECB assess the interconnectedness of national financial systems and vulnerabilities threatening financial stability in the euro area as a whole.</p><p>In this context the Bundesbank has done a crucial job in containing the fallout from the financial crisis. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers immediate and determined action was crucial to avoid a meltdown of the financial system in Germany and the other euro area countries. The Bundesbank under the leadership of Axel offered the best possible diagnosis to protect the stability of the German banking sector at the height of the crisis. </p><p>Nonetheless, the financial crisis has revealed serious weaknesses in existing supervisory arrangements both at the national and euro area level. In response to these shortcomings, the EU among other initiatives has created the macro-prudential European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) in which the Eurosystem is very actively involved. Axel has generously devoted his time to the Steering Committee of the ESRB as he has done for the Financial Stability Board at the international level. </p><p>The second task for which the Eurosystem has to rely critically on the support of the national central banks is the implementation of monetary policy. This role comprises the conduct of monetary policy operations, the design and operation of payment systems and the provision of banknotes and coins. At several points in time the efficient and effective functioning of the infrastructure has been absolutely essential to the success of the euro. This was true in the very beginnings in 1999, it was true at the moment of the cash changeover in 2002 and it has been true most recently during the financial crisis. The Eurosystem infrastructure has been exposed to a formidable stress test and it has proved its robustness throughout.</p><p>Again, Bundesbank expertise proved immensely valuable, for example in the design of our new payment system TARGET2 but also in the design of our non-standard monetary policy measures, most notably our covered bonds purchase programme, which as you know are a German innovation dating back to the time of Friedrich des Großen. Their success over hundreds of years shows that asset-backed securities need not be toxic. Pfandbriefe are a prime example of finance at the service of people’s well-being. Therefore the Governing Council in May 2009 decided to lend its support to this asset class, following Axel’s advice.</p><p>Damit komme ich zum Schluss. Beruht der Erfolg des Euro nur auf Glück? Erlauben Sie mir, darauf mit einem Zitat zu antworten, das Axel Weber in anderem Kontext zugeschrieben wird: „Nicht Glück – Können!“ </p><p>[</p><p>1</p><p>]</p><p> „Und Beharrlichkeit“ würde ich in unserem Kontext hinzufügen. Das Eurosystem ist für die Zukunft sehr gut gerüstet.</p><p>Lieber Axel, ich wünsche Dir alles Gute für Deine Zukunft! </p><p>Lieber Jens, as you know, we are still living in a very demanding environment. The crisis is not over. The responsibilities of the private sector and public authorities are as important as ever during the last three years. The Eurosystem has kept and will keep its sense of direction, strictly separating the standard measures, designed to deliver price stability, from the non-standard measures, designed to help restore a more correct monetary policy transmission mechanism. We shall never forget that we are issuing a single currency for 17 sovereign countries and 331 million citizens. This is a situation which has no equivalent in the world. More than ever, the unity of the Eurosystem and the unity of the Governing Council is of the essence.</p><p>Lieber Jens, herzlich willkommen im Eurosystem!</p><p>[</p><p>1</p><p>]</p><p>See the article “Axel Weber – ein Porträt: ‘Nicht Glück – Können!’“, authored by Marc Neller and Marietta Kurm-Engels, published in the Handelsblatt of 16-17 July 2010.</p><p>Reproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.</p><p> </p><p>Media contacts</p><p> </p>",entr
Jean-Claude Trichet: Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament,21-03-2011,European Central Bank,ECB,1706,"Dear Madam Chair,Dear Honourable Members,As on a number of occasions before, our regular meeting takes place in extraordinary times. The tragic developments in Japan with the deplorable loss of human lives, but also their potential global economic and financial implications have galvanised the international community into action. Here in Europe, our hearing today comes at a time between two meetings at the level of Heads of State or Government. And it comes at a time when the very important decisions on the economic governance reform in this Parliament are coming closer. Before focusing on the economic outlook and topics for today, let me therefore say a few words on the economic governance reform. As you know, the ECOFIN Council last week adopted a 'general approach' on this file. This approach contains a number of improvements. However, several very important proposals to sufficiently strengthen the governance framework are not yet considered. This is necessary to draw all the lessons from the crisis. Our European citizens, who care for our long-term future, ask the authorities to do whatever is necessary to prevent a recurrence of the developments we have experienced in recent years. Thus, in a ""Eurobarometer"" recent, almost 80% of citizens in the countries of the euro zone believe that greater coordination of economic policies between Member States - that is to say, effective and efficient governance - would necessary to combat the financial and economic crisis.[1]Ten days ago, the Member States have given an explanation for increased coordination of economic policy in the euro area. This declaration touched content many points of the present six legislative proposals. to leave Better still parallel as this declaration, there to share their key points in the current legislative procedure would be. This would allow the MoU get its full credibility.Let me turn to the euro area economic and monetary developments since our previous meeting last November. I will concentrate on the analysis of the Governing Council on the occasion of its meeting of 3 March. Incoming data have confirmed our view that the underlying momentum of economic activity remains positive. Looking ahead, we expect the economy to further benefit from the ongoing recovery in the world economy, the very accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system. As regards price developments, inflation in the euro area is on the rise. In February HICP inflation stood at 2.4%, after 2.3% in January. This increase largely reflects higher commodity prices. In particular, sharp increases in energy prices have led to upward price pressures in the earlier stages of the production process. It is crucial at this stage to avoid that the recent rise in inflation translates into broad-based second-round effects, for instance via price-setting or higher wages. Such effects would give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term.In the view of the Governing Council, as expressed on 3 March, risks to the price outlook are on the upside. Commodity prices could increase more than expected. Also, indirect taxes and administered prices could turn out higher given the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Finally, the ongoing recovery in activity could result in stronger than expected domestic price pressures.As regards our future monetary policy stance, I have nothing to add to what I said, on behalf of the Governing Council, on the occasion of our last monetary policy decision meeting earlier this month.As regards liquidity-providing operations, the Governing Council decided to conduct them in the second quarter of 2011 on the same conditions as in the first quarter of 2011. This means that we will continue to apply fixed-rate tender procedures with full allotment in all our refinancing operations at least until mid-July. Let me now turn to the specific topics you have asked me to address and start with sovereign debt. I should like to emphasise once again that the right way to avoid the risk of sovereign debt crises in an economic and monetary union is through sound national macroeconomic policies and strengthened economic governance. At the same time, the governments have considered that a permanent crisis management mechanism would be useful. From the side of the European Central Bank, the design of such a mechanism is essential for it to provide a positive contribution to financial stability in the euro area as a whole. I would like to highlight two aspects: first, the mechanism may in no way weaken the incentives for sound fiscal and macroeconomic policies pursued in all member states. It must in particular not weaken incentives for preemptive fiscal and macroeconomic adjustment by countries concerned, thereby avoiding moral hazard. Second, given that the euro area is characterised by an exceptionally high degree of economic and financial integration among countries, the mechanism should be able to employ a range of instruments to be effective in stemming against contagion in situations of acute market instability. If indispensable, supporting countries while still keeping some market access, may be an appropriate way and would imply a prudent use of funds. In this context, I continue to consider secondary market interventions as a helpful tool in this context. Regarding the institutional method to set up the ESM, the ECB, like the Parliament, supports the largest possible recourse to the Union method. It would welcome that, on the basis of the experience gained, the ESM could become a Union mechanism at the appropriate point in time. In the meantime, the ECB encourages that the assessment of circumstances leading to the activation of the ESM and the conditions on financial assistance entail an appropriate involvement of Union institutions, thus benefiting from their expertise and their Union-wide perspective.Turning to the issue of bank resolution, the presence of sound bank resolution mechanisms, limiting the costs associated to a bank failure in the case of a cross-border group, is likely to facilitate the negotiations to share the public costs incurred if and when required. Therefore, we support the overriding policy objective of the new EU framework for bank recovery and resolution proposed by the Commission. Although the implementation of the new resolution regime in the EU could already reduce the fiscal costs of bank failures, I believe that explicit arrangements should also be put in place to ensure that in the future the financial sector bears the burden of possible crises to come. As part of a credible resolution framework, bank levies (possibly accumulated in resolution funds) could possibly be considered.However, a levy on banks should be seen as a complementary tool in the set of instruments aiming at increasing the loss absorbency of systematically important banks – notably capital and liquidity surcharges, and contingent capital. The Financial Stability Board is currently exploring several options, in particular on contingent convertible capital and bail-in debt instruments. To this end, I welcome the fact that the European Commission is considering bank levies and bail-in in its plans for the future EU crisis management framework. The ECB stands ready to further contribute to the challenging work that is still ahead of us in the development of this framework.I would like to take the opportunity of today’s meeting to address another topical issue: the finalisation of the proposed EU Regulation for OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories. We would welcome if the draft report of your Committee on this significant legislative initiative took account of the important role that central banks play for ensuring the stability and efficiency of market infrastructures. Central banks have proven their relevant role during the financial crisis and we would thus welcome that their contribution to financial stability be fully reflected in the new Regulation. This means that the central banks would be adequately involved in the new EU framework for central counterparties (CCPs) and trade repositories. They would cooperate with supervisors in the authorisation and the ongoing risk assessment of infrastructures, technical standard-setting and decisions regarding the recognitions of third country central counterparties and repositories. Regarding the arrangements for cooperation and information-sharing among authorities, the Commission’s proposal of colleges provides, in our view, a set-up that is preferable to bilateral contacts between those authorities and ESMA. Let me now say a few words on the other subject you suggested: so-called ‘Eurobonds’. The ECB is not in favour of introducing such ‘Eurobonds’, understood as guaranteed government bonds on a joint and several basis, in the present circumstances. We note that the aim is to support the development of euro area bond markets, as well as at providing a possible mechanism to alleviate or resolve the ongoing sovereign debt crisis. With respect to supporting the euro area bond market, the main advantage could be cost savings from reducing the liquidity premium in the bond markets. This could arise particularly if Eurobonds gained benchmark status, comparable for instance to US Treasury bonds. As regards the impact on sovereign debt developments, moving to Eurobonds would remove the financial market pressure in the short term but, if not replaced by new mechanisms, fundamentally reduce incentives for sound fiscal policies. In our institutional set-up, fiscal discipline is induced via existing domestic provisions; the fundamental institutional framework of governance (the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact) and the assessment by savers and investors. Jointly guaranteed bonds would not permit savers and investors to assess fiscal policies of individual countries. As long as we do not have a political federation with a federal budget, this would create an incentive problem. It would impair the incentives for fiscal prudence at the domestic level. Consequently, Eurobonds would be the natural counterpart if national fiscal competences were clearly at the level of a union which would be a federation. In the present institutional framework we need to make very important progress in the collegial governance and surveillance of fiscal policies which remain national. Dear Honourable Members, I thank you for your attention and am at your disposal for questions.[1] Eurobarometer vol. 74 on Economic Governance in the European Union (published 12 January 2011). It shows that on average (unweighted) close to 80% of respondents in euro countries consider “a stronger coordination of economic and financial policies between Member States to be effective in combating the financial crisis.”Reproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.

Jean-Claude Trichet: I am still learning – The legacy of Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa,01-02-2011,European Central Bank,ECB,1701,"Mr President of the Republic,Dear Members of the family of Tommaso, Dear Mario Monti, Dear Carlo Ciampi, Cher Jacques Delors, Dear Romano Prodi, Dear Paul Volcker, Dear Mario Draghi,Dear Friends from all over Europe and the world, Ladies and Gentlemen,  ""I still learn"" – “I am still learning”. This is the name of a painting by the late Spanish painter Francisco Goya. A beautiful, colourful souvenir with this very motto – “I am still learning” – is what Tommaso gave to his colleagues when he completed his seven-year mandate as a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, in 2005. It was well chosen. For it encapsulates his own tireless search for knowledge and new ideas and in particular how Tommaso saw, and shaped, the world around him: central banking, the single currency and European unification. Tommaso once told to me what his high school teachers advised him in his early youth: that he needed to decide what interests him most: whether to understand or whether to change the world. The choice of Tommaso was economics. And, because the subject of economics is human action, he thought that the call for action would prevail, in his motivations, over the enquiring spirit. I remain profoundly impressed by the remarkable capacity of Tommaso to combine practical activity with deep reflection and accurate analysis, without which action would be ineffective. This has been his way to be in the world and to search for truth. In 1998, Tommaso joined the European Central Bank (ECB) to serve a currency and an institution that few had believed would be created in time according to the Treaty. A currency and an institution he had contributed to design when he was a rapporteur of the Delors Committee. The institution was assigned the extraordinary mission to deliver to 11 and, soon after, 12 nations and 300 million Europeans a currency which would have the highest level of confidence and credibility from the start. Over the course of his central banking career, Tommaso gradually developed a general paradigm of what he believed central banking involves. This paradigm is drawn from the evolution of modern central banks over the last 200 years. As the role of money – as a means of payment, a unit of account and a store of value – evolved over time, also what he called the triadic function of central banking evolved. In his view, ensuring price stability refers to money as a unit of account and a store of value; operating and supervising the payment system refers to money as a means of payment; and pursuing the stability of banks refers to money as a means of payment and a store of value. I would add that price stability is the primary goal, the primary mandate and that ensuring price stability is also a precondition for the other functions to be correctly exerted. Tommaso’s paradigm still provides a single and consistent order, in which the responsibilities of a central bank have their place. To each of these activities – from monetary policy to banknote printing, to market operations, financial stability, payment systems, relations with other public institutions, dialogue with the financial community and international cooperation – Tommaso has been assigned at different stages of his professional life. In all these activities the central bank pursues and represents the public interest of a sound and credible currency, one that preserves its value over time.And it is with great pride that I say today, in particular thanks to Tommaso’s contribution, together with all members of the Executive Board, of the Governing Council and the staff of the ECB, that our primary mandate has been fulfilled: with an average inflation rate in the euro area over the past 12 years of 1.97%, the ECB governing council has delivered what 330 million Europeans expect – “ the protection of savings”, “ to secure the currency”, “ ensuring price stability”. This remarkable track record has been delivered by a team of, today, 18 central banks (the ECB, as captain of the team, and the national central banks of the 17 euro area countries), which we call the Eurosystem. From the very beginning, Tommaso saw the challenge of making the full body of the Eurosystem an effective, continent-wide central bank, to make all its components act together, as I call it, as a true team, with a strong and dedicated team spirit. It has not always been easy to draw the appropriate line between preserving the diversity of national traditions, cultures and institutional arrangements, which illustrate the richness of Europe, and being European in the definition of the policy missions and pursuing the public interest. Tommaso was a central banker by profession, but he was also an advocate of a united Europe by deep personal conviction. European unification as a project which is economic in content and historically strategic. On the one hand, the creation of a single market was a process. A process that could ultimately lead to the contradiction which Tommaso referred to as the “inconsistent quartet” – that free trade, free mobility of capital, a system of fixed exchange rates and autonomous national monetary policies were incompatible. One of the four would come under pressure and would have be surrendered in order to avoid inconsistency. The single currency was the way to square the circle in merging all the independent national monetary policies. One single money for one single market. Tommaso saw the creation of the single currency as an ultimate integrative step, in the clearly defined policy field of monetary policy and was very aware of the responsibility given to the ECB to make this a success and a stepping stone for completing and achieving economic integration. The euro contained a strong commitment to move towards more economic integration. One of the lessons of the present crisis is precisely the necessity to not only very strictly apply the governance of the fiscal policy that was enshrined in the Maastricht treaty and in the Stability and Growth Pact, but to reinforce very significantly this governance and to enlarge it to the surveillance of competitive indicators and macropolicies.This is why I called, on behalf of the governing council of the ECB, for a quantum leap towards strengthening the institutional foundations of EMU and deepening economic union. The framework for economic governance needs to take into account that the euro area must operate, de facto, as a quasi-fiscal federation, in which the college of participating governments has the responsibility of exerting a very strong surveillance on national economic and fiscal policies. Tommaso has always been very profoundly convinced that it was necessary to reinforce considerably the E letter in EMU in order for Economic Union (EU) to be fully commensurate to Monetary Union (MU). And the time to move is now.We need, in particular, a stronger role of EU institutions, quasi-automaticity of the surveillance process, quasi-automaticity of sanctions, a much more effective enforcement. We need sound economic and fiscal policies to be performed individually by each nation and to be effectively and rigorously controlled by the peers, in each member’s very own interest and in the interest of all. When the sad news of Tommaso’s passing away reached us, we were preparing the inaugural meeting of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), which I have the honour to chair. Poor Tommaso passed away before we had the ESRB inaugural meeting on 20 January 2011. In commemorating Tommaso and his legacy, the ESRB deserves a particular mention because the reform of Europe’s supervisory architecture was, like the single currency, one of his more profoundly held professional concerns. Indeed, Europe has been confronted with the problem of asymmetry between economic development and institutional response also in the area of financial markets. While financial integration in the Single Market was progressing, regulation and supervision remained fragmented. Tommaso devoted a large part of his professional life to overcoming this fragmentation and making regulatory and supervisory structures commensurate with the realities of integrated European financial markets. He argued tirelessly in favour of a single rule book for financial institutions and was among the first to call for the establishment of supervisory authorities at EU level. With the setting up of the European System of Financial Supervision, and three European Supervisory Authorities and the European Systemic Risk Board, we are a step closer to overcoming this asymmetry. Our dear dear Tommaso, the militant of the European Union, the president of “Notre Europe”, founded by Jacques Delors, used to quote Jean Monnet frequently. One of the quotations he loved - and that I love - is the following: ""When it is determined on the goal we want to achieve, we must act without making assumptions about the risk of not succeeding. As long as you did not try, you can not say something is impossible. ""Which I would translate – firstly, in Italian and then in English:""When you have decided on the goal you want to achieve, you have to act without making assumptions about the risks of failure. As long as you have not tried, you can not say that something is impossible. ""“When one is determined as regards the desired goal, one must act without making multiple hypotheses on the risks of failure. As long as you did not try it, you cannot state that the endeavour is impossible”.It is that very spirit of the founding fathers that Tommaso was always referring to. That very spirit of the founding fathers that is inspiring us today when we are drawing the lessons from the crisis.Tommaso was not only a man of culture, a brilliant economist, a remarkable central banker, an important member of the Italian government, a true and visionary European. He was also an extraordinary and exemplary friend. The depth of his culture and his personal qualities helped him to establish exceptional and friendly relationship with his colleagues. I can say it in French, beautifully, because he spoke French better than the French, as Jacques Delors knows better than anyone. Tommaso thank you, our dear friend, our friend lamented for this deep friendship and pout all that you have done in the service of our European Union. I thank you for your attention.Reproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.

Jean-Claude Trichet: Economic and Monetary Union: What we have achieved and what we must do next,07-01-2011,European Central Bank,ECB,2683,"Dear Sir or Madam,thank you very much for the invitation to your conclave in Wildbad Kreuth. I wish you and your family a healthy and peaceful year 2011thThe past year has provided all of us with special challenges, and I am pleased to speak with you about the challenges in the current year. Let me advance my main message can be summarized as follows. We have in the EU an economicandMonetary union. As this name suggests, the Union is founded on two pillars: an economic pillar and a monetary pillar.For the monetary pillar, the European Central Bank, its independence and its unique alignment stand on price stability. Price stability in terms of average annual inflation rate in the medium term of just under 2% is guaranteed.The euro is a stable currency, as stable as its most stable predecessor currencies, including the D-Mark. And this applies to an area which now comprises 331 million people. Price stability for this large currency area to have secured, and properly secured for the foreseeable future, to know all the indicators - that is the ultimate achievement of the monetary pillar of Economic and Monetary Union.The second pillar is economic policy. For this column are the Stability and Growth Pact, the orientation of the general economic policy and the effective mutual monitoring of financial and economic policy.Unfortunately, this second pillar has considerable shortcomings revealed. The Stability and Growth Pact is first softened and been violated, the general economic policy has not been aligned in all countries for stability, and the mutual monitoring was not often effective.The developments in the last year are closely linked to the vulnerability of the economic policy pillar. Therefore, the basic challenge for this year, to strengthen the economic and fiscal pillar so that it bears. This requires a quantum leap in the design and implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, and a stability-oriented general economic policies of all countries. Economic weakness and a loss of competitiveness must be corrected in time.For this, the Member States must recognize that the euro is not just a common monetary policy, but also requires a stability-oriented alignment of the respective national financial and economic policies. This finding must be consistently implemented in practice. The current proposals to go according to the ECB not go far enough and a more ambitious approach is appropriate here.As far as the summary of my message today. I ask you to allow me to continue in English. Behind us lies a year of remarkable changes, but also remarkable achievements. After the worst recession in decades, economic growth has resumed in Europe. The German economy, in particular, has fared much better than many had anticipated. And with more than 60% of German exports staying within the EU, rising demand from other European countries has made a significant contribution to that recovery.But 2010 was also a year of great challenges. The euro area economy was severely tested by developments related to the weakened standing of several sovereigns. In response, Europe’s leaders chose to take some tough and courageous decisions. None were easy, but they were necessary and they are beginning to pay off. In 2011 we must strengthen our efforts even more. We need to see further significant progress on the reduction of excessive fiscal deficits. And we have to build and implement an effective rigorous framework for economic governance in the euro area. Current proposals go some way towards repairing the institutional shortcomings that the recent past has exposed. Vulnerabilities will be detected and made public earlier. There will be less discretion in applying and enforcing macroeconomic and fiscal discipline in Member States. But Europe cannot afford to rest halfway – we need to be more ambitious. The proposals that we have seen in Brussels do not go far enough in the ECB’s view. As I have said before, we need to make a quantum leap in our economic governance. We must achieve a framework where each and every country respects the principle that a successful economic and monetary union is based on sound macro policies. There must be a binding code of conduct for all parties concerned. * * *Today I would like to share with you my views on how, together, we can fulfil that duty, building on the notable achievements and stable foundations of our single monetary policy. The credibility of the ECB rests on its independence, the transparency of its strategy and the consistency of its words and actions. I will also argue that the euro area’s new surveillance framework should be built on these three principles – of independence, transparency and consistency of words and deeds.The Treaty assigns to the European Central Bank (ECB) the single objective of price stability. The ECB has provided a clear definition of this objective, as annual inflation in the euro area of below 2%, but close to 2%, over the medium term. Since its establishment in the summer of 1998 the ECB has worked hard to fulfil this objective. The results are very clear. We have seen 12 years of low inflation and low interest rates. The average annual inflation rate in the euro area has been 1.97%. It is the best result in terms of price stability for any large euro area country over the past 50 years. So the ECB has performed its duty. As a result, millions of European citizens have seen their purchasing power and the value of their savings preserved. Speaking before the CSU, I would like to recall the concern expressed by Franz-Josef Strauss back in 1978. In connection with the establishment of a European Monetary System, he had warned ""Europe must be no inflation Community!""I tell you now: Europe has become no inflation Community. And it will not be.Indeed, in Germany, the inflation rate has been even lower than the euro area average over the past 12 years: 1.5% per year on average between 1999 and 2010. By comparison, the average annual rate of inflation in Germany in the 1990s prior to the introduction of the euro was 2.2%. In the 1980s, it was 2.8% and in the 1970s, 4.9%. The steady course of monetary policy in the euro area has also contributed substantially to stabilising medium to long-term inflation expectations at a level consistent with price stability. This is a remarkable accomplishment, especially given the numerous economic and financial shocks we have had to face since the ECB came into being. These achievements have not come at the expense of employment. On the contrary, since Economic and Monetary Union began, employment in the euro area has risen by over 14 million, compared with close to 8 million in the United States. And these achievements have not come at the expense of growth either. Adjusted for population growth differences, growth in the euro area has been almost the same as in the United States over the past decade, at about 1% per year in terms of GDP per capita growth.The euro is now well established as a credible currency, of which citizens can be proud. This is important for all the Member States of our union, both individually and collectively, as we together face the challenges of the global economy.None of these achievements happened by accident. They were only possible because our actions were enshrined in our medium-term oriented monetary policy strategy.The financial crisis has changed neither our strategy, nor our objective. The ECB’s response to the crisis has always been in line with both our strategy and our medium-term objective of price stability. But we did broaden the range of our tools to adapt monetary policy to the challenges of the crisis. What we did was to insure euro area banks against present and future liquidity shortfalls. Banks are the backbone of our financial system. 70% of firms’ external financing comes from banks. They finance a very large share of the investments made in Europe. Jeopardising banks’ ability to lend to companies would have meant jeopardising the jobs of millions of Europeans. Because of the crucial role of banks in the real economy, we decided to provide liquidity in unlimited volumes and with longer maturities to banks. In parallel, we reduced the interest rate at which they can borrow to a historical low of 1%. And we launched a programme to purchase euro-denominated covered bonds, i.e. Pfandbriefe, issued in the euro area. The aim was to jump-start this market, which had suffered considerably in the crisis and which is so important for Europe. Overall, the Eurosystem – the ECB and the national central banks – purchased EUR 60 billion of Pfandbriefe across the euro area. This has provided an important contribution to revitalising this market after the crisis. We will hold the bonds to maturity and the profits will be distributed to our shareholders. Because of these and a number of other important steps, fears of a “Kreditklemme” have not materialised. Our bank lending surveys show that lending in the euro area – even in the middle of the crisis – was not significantly constrained by supply-side factors. That being said, monetary policy responsibility can not substitute for government irresponsibility. Excessive government borrowing by some Member States led to a seizing-up of the market for government paper. This market plays a central role in our financial system and constitutes a crucial element in the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy. Fire sales of government bonds imply a sharp deterioration in banks’ funding conditions. Confronted with a serious dysfunction in important segments of financial markets, the Governing Council of the ECB decided to intervene. The reason for the decision was certainly not to finance debt-laden Member States, but to address some severe malfunctioning of markets, so as to help ensure a better functioning of the transmission of monetary policy to all euro area economies. Let me stress solemnly that our monetary policy stance is itself designed to deliver price stability over the medium term. In any case, we told all governments that they had to correct drastically their fiscal policies. This was not new. It has been our constant message to executive branches: governments must restore fiscal sustainability without delay. This brings me to the second part of my remarks. After one of the most difficult years for our still young common currency, it is time to turn the page. It is time for each and every Member State to live up to its responsibilities. And it is time to strengthen the code of conduct for national governments, notably the Stability and Growth Pact, of which I will not hesitate to say that Theo Waigel is the founding father.We know that for several years fiscal policies in some countries have breached both the letter and the spirit of the Pact. The problems that hit some European bond markets last year were a visible and tangible testimony of fiscal misconduct. The watering-down of the Pact in 2004 and 2005 by Europe’s largest economies was a quieter event, but it was no less grave. In that period, Member States chose to change the rules rather than their policies. The ECB voiced its “grave concerns” at the time. Today, governments have no choice but to change their policies. And they must substantially reinforce the Stability and Growth Pact. And it is not only fiscal policies that need to be brought back onto the path of virtue. In several countries, macroeconomic policies more generally need to be aligned with best practice. Germany went through some painful years of macroeconomic adjustment. Not so long ago it was called the sick man of Europe. Since then, relative unit labour costs have been improved, labour market barriers have been lowered and employment has risen. Today, the German economy is highly competitive with increasing domestic demand. But because some economies were less courageous in pushing forward necessary structural reforms, the competitive gap between countries in the euro area has widened. The primary symptoms of a widening competitive gap are unit labour costs, inflation differentials and mounting current account imbalances. Their long-term damage could take the form of persistent differentials in output growth, income and welfare. We can see the primary symptoms. We are now poised to avert the long-term damage and ensure a smooth long-term functioning of the euro area. So the period ahead is about two things: fiscal consolidation and measures to strengthen the growth potential of our economies. Both must be monitored by a rigorous and credible surveillance framework. Currently there is an open and frank exchange of views about the concrete design of the new surveillance framework. Let me give you a little more detail about the ECB’s views on such a framework. For fiscal policies three elements are indispensable: shorter deadlines under excessive deficit procedures;quasi-automatic application of sanctions;and ambitious targets for the reduction of public debt towards the 60% of GDP ceiling.The severity of the breach should determine the severity of the sanction. Country missions, fines, reduced access to EU funds, and other pecuniary consequences are necessary. We should be inflexible in applying sanctions if rules are breached. In limiting the power of discretion, we will strengthen the power of the Pact. Decisions are what we need for sanctions to be credible. Only then will they give national policy-makers the right incentives. This is why we are calling for quasi-automaticity. There should be greater focus than before on government debt levels, more automaticity, along with improved national fiscal rules and better statistical data.The second area of policy slippage concerns macroeconomic policies. In a monetary union, national developments in prices and costs have to take account of the fact that it is a union of monetary stability. Therefore, national price and cost developments that are significantly higher than the union average entail significant losses over time in competitiveness. Competitiveness losses cannot be sustained forever, and adjustments in unsustainable economic policies have to be made. Fiscal and structural policies need to keep domestic demand in line with rates of sustainable growth and price stability. For monitoring macroeconomic policies we have to build a new framework from scratch. Here is what we propose:a limited number of clearly defined quantitative indicators to identify undesirable developments;transparency about the procedures and the sanctions;and a set of reliable statistical data, interpreted and acted on by independent arbiters. We have advocated that a specific scoreboard should be designed for euro area countries. A detailed and self-contained scoreboard offers a concrete basis for assessment. Credibility of our analysis is key. But credibility is not a right, it has to be earned. The credibility of the ECB rests on our independence, the transparency of our strategy and the consistency of our words and deeds. Likewise, Europe’s new surveillance framework should be built on these three principles – of independence in the assessment of the fiscal situation as well as of the soundness of macroeconomic policies; transparency of the procedures; and consistency of words and deeds. Let me draw to a close with a few words on the ECB’s role in the crisis. As I have explained, the institutional model of the ECB has proved its worth by delivering price stability over the first 12 years of the euro’s existence. This is fully in line with our primary mandate according to the Maastricht Treaty.As I frequently said, all institutions, whether European or national, must be up to their responsibilities. The ECB is responsible for monetary union, in full independence. The national governments, individually and collectively, duly enlightened by the Commission, are responsible for the Economic Union. The European governments have to fulfil their duties in full. They must face up with the present difficulties by implementing rigorously their national adjustment programmes and by considerably reinforcing their collective governance of Economic Union. We all have to be guided by a clear sense of direction towards the consolidation of EMU and the strengthening of European unity. In an international environment which comprehends so many hard challenges and so many opportunities Europe must be ahead of the curve and not behind the curve. Europe today stands for peace, freedom and prosperity. The founders of the European Union would be justifiably proud of the accomplishments that have been achieved together over the past 60 years. Let us build on these achievements.Thank you for your attention. Thank you for your attention.Reproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.

attent thank attent reproduct permit provid sourc acknowledg media contact,"<p>Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,</p><p>ich danke Ihnen sehr herzlich für die Einladung zu Ihrer Klausurtagung in Wildbad Kreuth. Ich wünsche Ihnen und Ihren Angehörigen ein gesundes und friedvolles Jahr 2011. </p><p>Das vergangene Jahr hat uns alle vor besondere Herausforderungen gestellt, und ich freue mich, mit Ihnen über die Herausforderungen im laufenden Jahr zu sprechen. </p><p>Lassen Sie mich vorab meine zentrale Botschaft wie folgt zusammenfassen. Wir haben in der EU eine Wirtschafts- </p><p>und</p><p> Währungsunion. Wie dieser Name besagt, beruht die Union auf zwei Säulen: einer wirtschaftspolitischen Säule und einer währungspolitischen Säule. </p><p>Für die währungspolitische Säule stehen die Europäische Zentralbank, ihre Unabhängigkeit und ihre eindeutige Ausrichtung auf Preisstabilität. Preisstabilität im Sinne einer durchschnittlichen jährlichen Inflationsrate auf mittlere Frist von knapp unter 2% ist gewährleistet. </p><p>Der Euro ist eine stabile Währung, so stabil wie seine stabilsten Vorgängerwährungen, einschließlich der D-Mark. Und dies gilt für ein Währungsgebiet, das nunmehr 331 Millionen Menschen umfasst. Preisstabilität für diesen großen Währungsraum gesichert zu haben, und sie allen Indikatoren entsprechend auch für die absehbare Zukunft gesichert zu wissen – das ist die entscheidende Errungenschaft der währungspolitischen Säule in der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion. </p><p>Die zweite Säule ist die Wirtschaftspolitik. Für diese Säule stehen der Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakt, die Ausrichtung der allgemeinen Wirtschaftspolitik und die effektive gegenseitige Überwachung der Finanz- und Wirtschaftspolitik. </p><p>Leider hat diese zweite Säule erhebliche Defizite offenbart. Der Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakt ist zunächst aufgeweicht und dann verletzt worden, die allgemeine Wirtschaftspolitik ist nicht in allen Ländern auf Stabilität ausgerichtet gewesen, und die gegenseitige Überwachung war oftmals nicht effektiv. </p><p>Die Entwicklungen im letzten Jahr sind eng mit den Schwachstellen der wirtschaftspolitischen Säule verzahnt. Daher ist die grundlegende Herausforderung für dieses Jahr, die wirtschafts- und finanzpolitische Säule so zu stärken, dass sie trägt. Dies erfordert einen Quantensprung in der Gestaltung und Implementierung des Stabilitäts- und Wachstumspakts, und eine stabilitätsorientierte allgemeine Wirtschaftspolitik aller Länder. Wirtschaftliche Schwächen und Wettbewerbsverluste müssen rechtzeitig korrigiert werden. </p><p>Dazu müssen die Mitgliedstaaten erkennen, dass der Euro nicht nur eine gemeinsame Geldpolitik bedeutet, sondern auch eine stabilitätsorientierte Ausrichtung der jeweiligen, nationalen Finanz- und Wirtschaftspolitik erfordert. Diese Erkenntnis muss konsequent in der Praxis umgesetzt werden. Die derzeitigen Vorschläge dazu gehen nach Auffassung der EZB nicht weit genug und ein ambitionierteres Vorgehen ist hier angemessen. </p><p>Soweit die Zusammenfassung meiner Botschaft heute. </p><p>Ich bitte Sie, mir zu gestatten in Englisch fortzufahren. </p><p>Behind us lies a year of remarkable changes, but also remarkable achievements. After the worst recession in decades, economic growth has resumed in Europe. The German economy, in particular, has fared much better than many had anticipated. And with more than 60% of German exports staying within the EU, rising demand from other European countries has made a significant contribution to that recovery.</p><p>But 2010 was also a year of great challenges. The euro area economy was severely tested by developments related to the weakened standing of several sovereigns. In response, Europe’s leaders chose to take some tough and courageous decisions. None were easy, but they were necessary and they are beginning to pay off. </p><p>In 2011 we must strengthen our efforts even more. We need to see further significant progress on the reduction of excessive fiscal deficits. And we have to build and implement an effective rigorous framework for economic governance in the euro area. </p><p>Current proposals go some way towards repairing the institutional shortcomings that the recent past has exposed. Vulnerabilities will be detected and made public earlier. There will be less discretion in applying and enforcing macroeconomic and fiscal discipline in Member States. </p><p>But Europe cannot afford to rest halfway – we need to be more ambitious. The proposals that we have seen in Brussels do not go far enough in the ECB’s view. As I have said before, we need to make a quantum leap in our economic governance. We must achieve a framework where each and every country respects the principle that a successful economic and monetary union is based on sound macro policies. There must be a binding code of conduct for all parties concerned. </p><p>* * *</p><p>Today I would like to share with you my views on how, together, we can fulfil that duty, building on the notable achievements and stable foundations of our single monetary policy. </p><p>The credibility of the ECB rests on its independence, the transparency of its strategy and the consistency of its words and actions. I will also argue that the euro area’s new surveillance framework should be built on these three principles – of independence, transparency and consistency of words and deeds.</p><p>The Treaty assigns to the European Central Bank (ECB) the single objective of price stability. The ECB has provided a clear definition of this objective, as annual inflation in the euro area of below 2%, but close to 2%, over the medium term. </p><p>Since its establishment in the summer of 1998 the ECB has worked hard to fulfil this objective. The results are very clear. We have seen 12 years of low inflation and low interest rates. The average annual inflation rate in the euro area has been 1.97%. It is the best result in terms of price stability for any large euro area country over the past 50 years. </p><p>So the ECB has performed its duty. As a result, millions of European citizens have seen their purchasing power and the value of their savings preserved. </p><p>Speaking before the </p><p>CSU</p><p>, I would like to recall the concern expressed by Franz-Josef Strauss back in 1978. In connection with the establishment of a European Monetary System, he had warned </p><p>“Europa darf keine Inflations­gemein­schaft werden!”</p><p> Ich sage Ihnen heute: Europa ist keine Inflationsgemeinschaft geworden. Und wird es nicht werden. </p><p>Indeed, in Germany, the inflation rate has been even lower than the euro area average over the past 12 years: 1.5% per year on average between 1999 and 2010. By comparison, the average annual rate of inflation in Germany in the 1990s prior to the introduction of the euro was 2.2%. In the 1980s, it was 2.8% and in the 1970s, 4.9%. </p><p>The steady course of monetary policy in the euro area has also contributed substantially to stabilising medium to long-term inflation expectations at a level consistent with price stability. This is a remarkable accomplishment, especially given the numerous economic and financial shocks we have had to face since the ECB came into being. </p><p>These achievements have not come at the expense of employment. On the contrary, since Economic and Monetary Union began, employment in the euro area has risen by over 14 million, compared with close to 8 million in the United States. And these achievements have not come at the expense of growth either. Adjusted for population growth differences, growth in the euro area has been almost the same as in the United States over the past decade, at about 1% per year in terms of GDP per capita growth.</p><p>The euro is now well established as a credible currency, of which citizens can be proud. This is important for all the Member States of our union, both individually and collectively, as we together face the challenges of the global economy.</p><p>None of these achievements happened by accident. They were only possible because our actions were enshrined in our medium-term oriented monetary policy strategy.</p><p>The financial crisis has changed neither our strategy, nor our objective. The ECB’s response to the crisis has always been in line with both our strategy and our medium-term objective of price stability. </p><p>But we did broaden the range of our tools to adapt monetary policy to the challenges of the crisis. What we did was to insure euro area banks against present and future liquidity shortfalls. Banks are the backbone of our financial system. 70% of firms’ external financing comes from banks. They finance a very large share of the investments made in Europe. Jeopardising banks’ ability to lend to companies would have meant jeopardising the jobs of millions of Europeans. </p><p>Because of the crucial role of banks in the real economy, we decided to provide liquidity in unlimited volumes and with longer maturities to banks. In parallel, we reduced the interest rate at which they can borrow to a historical low of 1%. </p><p>And we launched a programme to purchase euro-denominated covered bonds, i.e. Pfandbriefe, issued in the euro area. The aim was to jump-start this market, which had suffered considerably in the crisis and which is so important for Europe. Overall, the Eurosystem – the ECB and the national central banks – purchased EUR 60 billion of Pfandbriefe across the euro area. This has provided an important contribution to revitalising this market after the crisis. We will hold the bonds to maturity and the profits will be distributed to our shareholders. </p><p>Because of these and a number of other important steps, fears of a “Kreditklemme” have not materialised. Our bank lending surveys show that lending in the euro area – even in the middle of the crisis – was not significantly constrained by supply-side factors. </p><p>That being said, monetary policy responsibility can not substitute for government irresponsibility. Excessive government borrowing by some Member States led to a seizing-up of the market for government paper. This market plays a central role in our financial system and constitutes a crucial element in the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy. Fire sales of government bonds imply a sharp deterioration in banks’ funding conditions. </p><p>Confronted with a serious dysfunction in important segments of financial markets, the Governing Council of the ECB decided to intervene.

Jörg Asmussen: New ECB Premises topping out ceremony,20-09-2012,European Central Bank,ECB,1464,"Ladies and gentlemen,Fellow members of the Governing Council and General Council,Dear Mr. Mayor Feldmann,Dear Pöllath,Dear Professor Prix,Dear Sir or Madam,Today’s ceremony marks another significant milestone for the ECB’s new home and for the city of Frankfurt. The last time we came together here, for the ceremony to mark the laying of the foundation stone in spring 2010, the Grossmarkthalle and a large pit were the dominant features of the construction site, with the works not yet having begun. The ECB’s then President, Jean-Claude Trichet, warmly welcomed the construction companies and their workers. Today, two years and four months later, the site looks quite different. We owe this remarkable achievement to the many people who have been involved in this enormous project. On behalf of all my colleagues on the Governing Council, I would like to congratulate all of you who have helped to create this unique building complex. On behalf of all my colleagues of the Governing Council, I would like to congratulate all those who have helped to build this unique building complex.Some of you have been involved in this project from the very beginning, others joined at the planning stage and then, once the construction companies and their workers arrived on site, the number of project participants doubled. And yet more new partners will join us between now and when the new ECB premises are complete. I am impressed to see how COOP HIMMELB(L)AU’s vision has become reality over the last two years of intensive construction works.It was by the time I became member of the ECB’s Executive Board that the high-rise structure began to rise above the buildings around it. Looking eastward from my office in the Eurotower, I have been able to watch the towers grow, and now the high-rise can be seen from many locations within the city and even from outside the city. The main structural works for the high-rise have now been completed, and we are already one step closer to moving to the Ostend, the ECB’s new neighbourhood. Special thanks go to the construction companies, especially to all members of Züblin and Spannverbund and their subcontractors. Their continuous work and strong commitment to delivering the required quality on time has made it possible for us to have this celebration here today and to be able to gaze up at this impressive structure.It is a great achievement that we can already use all three of the main elements of the building complex: entering here via the entrance building, the future main entrance of the ECB, and celebrating the topping out in the Grossmarkthalle, actually in the future cafeteria, while enjoying the view of the double office tower. The vision of the architect Mr Wolf Prix and his team was to create a new and unique landmark, combining “old and new” and his vision has now come to fruition for the ECB, a truly European institution. Let us look back on some of the milestones that have been accomplished so far. The double office tower has almost reached its final height of 185 metres. The last office floor was laid a few weeks ago, while the various platforms and steel structures within the atrium are currently being completed. The restoration of the Grossmarkthalle is another remarkable element of the ongoing construction works. The former splendour of the facades and the concrete roof shell structure is slowly being restored, evoking again the vision of its architect, Martin Elsaesser. I would like to thank the company Torkret, which built the original market hall in the 1920s, for their excellent work and for being able to find suitable solutions – together with the architects and planners – for any surprise the old building fabric threw up.The next steps will also be important. Since the beginning of this year a myriad of technical equipment has been on site and hundreds of workers are busy installing the necessary technical infrastructure to ensure everything runs smoothly from an operational perspective once we move to our new premises. Fit-out works and the installation of walls and floors are also continuing in parallel, all taking place behind the newly completed facades of the high-rise and the restored Grossmarkthalle. Most visibly, the antenna and the technical areas will be installed at the top of the double office tower by the end of this year.We are monitoring the construction progress, costs and price developments very closely, adjusting and adapting where necessary. As a public institution, we are committed to using our resources responsibly. This is essential. So far the ECB has spent approximately €530 million in construction and other costs, including the purchase of the site. In 2005 the overall investment cost was estimated at €850 million at 2005 constant prices. It is anticipated that increases in the price of construction materials and construction activities from 2005 until the completion of the project in 2014 will lead to a €200 million increase in the overall investment cost. In addition, there have been a number of unforeseen challenges that needed to be dealt with. The two major challenges unforeseen in 2005 were, first, that the original tender for a general contractor did not yield a satisfactory result and the ECB had to change to a different contractor model, and second, that the Grossmarkthalle – a large industrial heritage building from 1928 – presented a number of challenges that were not detected in the initial examination conducted prior to the acquisition: the foundations turned out to be insufficient and required additional support; the roof coverage was found to be contaminated and therefore could not be disposed of as envisaged; and parts of the concrete construction had insufficient steel support. These factors are likely to account for additional costs of about €100-150 million, or a 10-14% increase in the overall investment cost. The resulting delay in the construction works on the Grossmarkthalle, as well as the entrance building, has been incorporated into the existing time schedule.I took on this project in the middle of the construction phase being aware that challenging projects as this face many obstacles. I hope that, as in the past, any future issues will be successfully overcome and that the result will fulfil our requirements. My thanks go to the entire team of the New ECB Premises Project Office, for their continuous commitment and relentless efforts. It is very impressive to see what all of you working on this project have achieved together so far, not only our Project Office, but also the architects, planners, project management experts and construction managers as well as the construction companies, their subcontractors and all experts and workers! I have full trust in all of you that the good cooperation and commitment to this European project will lead to a successful completion and a functional headquarters for the ECB and for all its staff and visitors. The end product will meet our objective to provide the ECB with energy-efficient, functional and safe headquarters, while allowing for the necessary flexibility to foster interaction and communication – not only among staff, but also with our colleagues of the Eurosystem, the European Systemic Risk Board and other institutions. In addition, the new premises will reflect the values – integrity, excellence, efficiency and transparency – that are essential to our activities. I am very glad that I stand here today and can say that so far no serious accident has occurred at the site - and that although hundreds of people working on the site at. I wish and hope that this will remain so for the remainder of construction like that. You all here on the site good luck and all the best. Stay healthy and fit well on to.I am grateful that I can stand here today and say that there have been no major accidents on the construction site – even though hundreds of people are working here at the same time. I very much wish that this will continue to be the case for the remainder of the construction process and extend my best wishes to all of you working here on the site. Stay healthy and safe.I hope that people can see here in Frankfurt and elsewhere our new building as an enrichment of the Frankfurt skyline and the European landscape. We in the ECB are pleased to be able to welcome you and all visitors from Frankfurt, Europe and the rest of the world in 2014 welcome to our new building.I hope that our new premises will be viewed by the people of Frankfurt, and beyond, as an enrichment of Frankfurt’s skyline and the landscape of Europe. We at the ECB look forward to welcoming all of you and all our visitors from Frankfurt, Europe and the world to our new home in 2014.Reproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.

contact,"<p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Fellow members of the Governing Council and General Council,</p><p>Sehr geehrter Herr Oberbürgermeister Feldmann,</p><p>Sehr geehrter Herr Pöllath,</p><p>Sehr geehrter Herr Professor Prix,</p><p>Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,</p><p>Today’s ceremony marks another significant milestone for the ECB’s new home and for the city of Frankfurt. The last time we came together here, for the ceremony to mark the laying of the foundation stone in spring 2010, the Grossmarkthalle and a large pit were the dominant features of the construction site, with the works not yet having begun. The ECB’s then President, Jean-Claude Trichet, warmly welcomed the construction companies and their workers. Today, two years and four months later, the site looks quite different. We owe this remarkable achievement to the many people who have been involved in this enormous project. </p><p>On behalf of all my colleagues on the Governing Council, I would like to congratulate all of you who have helped to create this unique building complex. </p><p>Im Namen aller meiner Kollegen des EZB-Rats möchte ich allen gratulieren, die dazu beigetragen haben, diesen einzigartigen Gebäudekomplex zu errichten.</p><p>Some of you have been involved in this project from the very beginning, others joined at the planning stage and then, once the construction companies and their workers arrived on site, the number of project participants doubled. And yet more new partners will join us between now and when the new ECB premises are complete. I am impressed to see how COOP HIMMELB(L)AU’s vision has become reality over the last two years of intensive construction works.</p><p>It was by the time I became member of the ECB’s Executive Board that the high-rise structure began to rise above the buildings around it. Looking eastward from my office in the Eurotower, I have been able to watch the towers grow, and now the high-rise can be seen from many locations within the city and even from outside the city. The main structural works for the high-rise have now been completed, and we are already one step closer to moving to the Ostend, the ECB’s new neighbourhood. </p><p>Special thanks go to the construction companies, especially to all members of Züblin and Spannverbund and their subcontractors. Their continuous work and strong commitment to delivering the required quality on time has made it possible for us to have this celebration here today and to be able to gaze up at this impressive structure.</p><p>It is a great achievement that we can already use all three of the main elements of the building complex: </p><p>entering here via the entrance building, the future main entrance of the ECB, and </p><p>celebrating the topping out in the Grossmarkthalle, actually in the future cafeteria, </p><p>while enjoying the view of the double office tower. </p><p>The vision of the architect Mr Wolf Prix and his team was to create a new and unique landmark, combining “old and new” and his vision has now come to fruition for the ECB, a truly European institution. </p><p>Let us look back on some of the milestones that have been accomplished so far. </p><p>The double office tower has almost reached its final height of 185 metres. The last office floor was laid a few weeks ago, while the various platforms and steel structures within the atrium are currently being completed. </p><p>The restoration of the Grossmarkthalle is another remarkable element of the ongoing construction works.

Ich wünsche mir und hoffe sehr, dass dies auch für die restliche Bauzeit so bleiben wird. Ihnen allen hier auf der Baustelle viel Glück und alles Gute.
