I will do it in my own style and will not change because it is the last time.              It was a memorable European Council, most of all because we reached a Climate and Energy deal              for Europe for the period 2020 to 2030. An important issue, one of the biggest challenges of              mankind – and one, I know, this Parliament deeply cares about.              Back in March, the European Council had set itself October as a deadline, and we've kept our              promise. We offer certainty to economic actors – for them to plan investments, to spur innovation,              to bolster research – and want to pass on a more sustainable planet to our grandchildren (and you              can take this literally).              Just last Sunday, the IPCC climate panel stressed in a robust and stark report how vital rapid              carbon emissions cuts are to stop the impact of climate change. This is where Europe now decides              to go for a reduction of at least 40% by 2030 – the world's most ambitious climate goal.              This decision allows the European Union to bring a positive message to the international climate              negotiations – a message of ambition, of commitment. No doubt, some of you would have wished              for more ambition on one aspect or another. To them I say: do not underestimate the importance in              itself of having reached an agreement, more than a year before the UN conference in Paris of              December 2015! From now on, our input to the Conference will be a reference for the negotiations              – perhaps even a rallying point.              After the deal, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon immediately saluted the European Union's              ""continued global leadership""; our climate goals were held-up as an example to other leading              players – also in the US debate. The European Council agreed four headline targets; all these              work in the same direction – to provide energy that is greener, more secure and affordable.              First, the climate target (which I already mentioned): a domestic reduction of at least 40% of              greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. This figure, which refers to 1990, is binding. And let me be              clear: it is fully in line with our ambitious long-term climate objective for 2050.

Here, we made sure that our international competitiveness or the              European jobs are not hampered by our ambition. The other half takes place in the non-ETS              sectors, with national, yet flexible and tradable targets to make our collective effort as cost-effective              as possible.              Second target: clean energy. We commit to at least 27% of renewables in 2030. Here we are              talking about a share of total energy consumed and the target is binding at EU-level. This is an              area where technology is changing fast, and where it is still early to project how behaviours will              change, so some of the details will be fleshed out at a later stage. Currently, EU-wide, the share of              renewables stands at about 14%, so 27% or more by 2030 means that by then Europe will at least              double the share of clean energy.              Third target: energy savings. We commit to an increase of at least 27% in energy efficiency. This              figure is indicative – just like in the previous programme – and compares to 2030 projections based              on current consumption and technology. It will be reviewed by 2020, having in mind an EU level of              30%. Beyond its others benefits, saving energy is the surest way of reducing our energy              dependency – another issue high on everybody's minds. I know many in this Parliament have              strong convictions about energy efficiency; once the relevant legislative proposals are on the table,              you can make that voice heard.              The fourth and final target: energy linkage. Interconnections help match supply and demand across              borders and also are an insurance in case domestic energy production is down. The objective is to              have electricity interconnection worth 15% by 2030. Here we focus on concrete projects, across              Europe, to achieve our goal, in electricity and also in gas. Such concrete projects are the best way              to go beyond paper declarations and truly build an Energy Union, a project which is, I know, of              great importance to this European Parliament.              Nous avons également discuté de la situation socio-économique. La reprise économique est plus              lente que beaucoup avaient pensé, après le retour de la stabilité de la zone euro à l’automne 2014.              La faiblesse de la croissance est en grande partie due à une baisse de notre potentiel de              croissance, estimé aujourd'hui à seulement 0,5%. C’est le résultat du taux élevé de chômage et              d'un niveau d’investissement trop bas. Il n’y a pas de miracles: la croissance est la somme de              l'augmentation du nombre d’heures travaillées et de la productivité. Or le manque d’emplois et              d’investissement met les deux sous pression. Donc une reprise ""conjoncturelle"" se heurte vite à              nos limites structurelles.              En plus de cela, des facteurs externes ont joué un rôle négatif. L’insécurité géopolitique érode la              confiance en Europe, et les performances des BRICs – plus faible que prévu pour la Chine, faibles              tout court pour le Brésil et la Russie – ont pesé sur nos exportations et sur la croissance des pays              de la zone euro qui en dépendent.              Les causes de la faible croissance économique ne sont pas à chercher du côté de la politique              monétaire, qui est accommodante. Elle n'est plus désormais à chercher du côté de la politique              budgétaire, dont l'orientation n'a pas pesé sur la croissance en 2014. Ces dernières années, on a              fait preuve de flexibilité dans la politique budgétaire en mettant l'accent non pas sur les déficits en              chiffres nominaux mais sur les déficits structurels. Les délais supplémentaires accordés en 2013              pour passer sous la barre des 3% du Traité de Maastricht en sont la preuve.              Maintenant, il faut se concentrer sur les réformes structurelles, en particulier améliorer le              fonctionnement des marchés du travail. Combattre la dualité entre les insiders et les outsiders,              entre ceux qui sont bien protégés et ceux avec des emplois précaires (souvent des jeunes, des              femmes, des immigrés…). D'autres réformes structurelles concernent le marché unique: l'union              énergétique, le marché numérique et bien sûr une vraie zone de recherche et d'innovation.               EUCO 244/14               2/3               Le Conseil européen a salué l'intention de la nouvelle Commission de stimuler des              investissements supplémentaires, pour un volume de 300 milliards d'euros sur les trois années à              venir. La responsabilité des Etats membres en termes de réformes mais aussi d'investissements              est grande. Stimuler les investissements, en termes économiques, c'est agir du côté de la              demande et du côté de l'offre en même temps!              La situation économique actuelle est compliquée puisque nous connaissons non seulement une              croissance économique trop faible, mais aussi une inflation exceptionnellement basse. Davantage,              d'ailleurs, dans les pays de la zone euro que dans les autres pays membres. Cela pèse sur les              dettes publiques et privées (et donc sur les investissements) – des dettes d'ailleurs qui sont déjà              trop élevées. Nous devons mobiliser des moyens, sans tabous, sans peur, sans obsessions, sans              idéologie, avec un mélange d'objectifs de court terme et de long terme et en respectant les              principes fondateurs de l'Union Economique et Monétaire.              Tout notre système socio-économique est bâti sur la croissance et l'emploi. Nous en sommes tous              intimement conscients. C'est pour cela, d'ailleurs que le sommet de la zone euro a demandé aux              ""quatre présidents"" de préparer pour décembre un rapport sur une coordination économique              renforcée. A mon avis, c'est un pas indispensable sur le chemin vers une véritable Union              Economique et Monétaire – chemin que nous avions tracé dans nos rapports de 2012.              The European Council also discussed foreign affairs. Leaders spoke about the terrible plague of              Ebola, in West Africa. Thanks to substantial commitments in the immediate run-up and even during              the meeting, together we reached 1 billion € in pledges for the fight against Ebola. This money              must now be put to good use. We also appointed an Ebola coordinator for the EU: incoming              Commissioner Stylianides.              The European Council then discussed Ukraine, as it has done in all our meetings since March, and              as it will continue to do as long as necessary. We called upon the Russian Federation to assume              its responsibilities for the full implementation of the Minsk Agreement. The energy deal for the              winter is a positive step. The illegal so-called elections in the Donbas area a very negative one.              As I mentioned, this European Council was the last one which I chaired. Leaders said good-bye,              and for my part, I shared with them how I've always tried to act in the name of the European              interest. This is not something abstract. It is more than the sum of twenty-eight national interests,              but it is also about getting to twenty-eight.              Each time we have to agree, with everyone around the table. Not always ""in one go"", and              sometimes with a bit of pulling and shoving… But together the members of the European Council,              with the other institutions, have shown the implausible: that a Union with twenty-eight countries can              work. I'm fully aware that the next five years will be as crucial as the previous one. We need results              in terms of growth and jobs to regain the trust of the people of Europe.              These past five years, I've also tried to show that the Union's institutions can work together. I am              grateful for that to the previous President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso –              with whom I worked well together from day one until last week. And I am also most grateful to the              two Presidents of the European Parliament with whom I've had the pleasure and privilege to work,              President Buzek and President Schulz. I had many contacts with many among you.              Of course, we can sometimes have divergent approaches, but the institutions are in my view not              rivals. We serve the same cause, Europe's cause, meaning ultimately the well-being of all our              citizens. And I know this is what drives the work of our institutions, which are, each in their own              way, so close to public opinion, the European Council, and you, the European Parliament. Thank              you.

Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council
            
Speech to the European Parliament following
            
the October 23-24 European Council
            

It is a pleasure to debrief you on the October European Council, the last one under my Presidency.
            
I will do it in my own style and will not change because it is the last time.
            
It was a memorable European Council, most of all because we reached a Climate and Energy deal
            
for Europe for the period 2020 to 2030. An important issue, one of the biggest challenges of
            
mankind – and one, I know, this Parliament deeply cares about.
            
Back in March, the European Council had set itself October as a deadline, and we've kept our

to bolster research – and want to pass on a more sustainable planet to our grandchildren (and you
            
can take this literally).

About half of the new effort will take place in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) – in our
            
energy and industry sectors. Here, we made sure that our international competitiveness or the

double the share of clean energy.
            
Third target: energy savings. We commit to an increase of at least 27% in energy efficiency. This

croissance, estimé aujourd'hui à seulement 0,5%. C’est le résultat du taux élevé de chômage et
            
d'un niveau d’investissement trop bas. Il n’y a pas de miracles: la croissance est la somme de
            
l'augmentation du nombre d’heures travaillées et de la productivité. Or le manque d’emplois et
            
d’investissement met les deux sous pression. Donc une reprise ""conjoncturelle"" se heurte vite à
            
nos limites structurelles.
            
En plus de cela, des facteurs externes ont joué un rôle négatif. L’insécurité géopolitique érode la
            
confiance en Europe, et les performances des BRICs – plus faible que prévu pour la Chine, faibles
            
tout court pour le Brésil et la Russie – ont pesé sur nos exportations et sur la croissance des pays
            
de la zone euro qui en dépendent.
            
Les causes de la faible croissance économique ne sont pas à chercher du côté de la politique
            
monétaire, qui est accommodante. Elle n'est plus désormais à chercher du côté de la politique
            
budgétaire, dont l'orientation n'a pas pesé sur la croissance en 2014. Ces dernières années, on a
            
fait preuve de flexibilité dans la politique budgétaire en mettant l'accent non pas sur les déficits en
            
chiffres nominaux mais sur les déficits structurels. Les délais supplémentaires accordés en 2013
            
pour passer sous la barre des 3% du Traité de Maastricht en sont la preuve.
            
Maintenant, il faut se concentrer sur les réformes structurelles, en particulier améliorer le
            
fonctionnement des marchés du travail. Combattre la dualité entre les insiders et les outsiders,
            
entre ceux qui sont bien protégés et ceux avec des emplois précaires (souvent des jeunes, des
            
femmes, des immigrés…). D'autres réformes structurelles concernent le marché unique: l'union
            
énergétique, le marché numérique et bien sûr une vraie zone de recherche et d'innovation.

Le Conseil européen a salué l'intention de la nouvelle Commission de stimuler des
            
investissements supplémentaires, pour un volume de 300 milliards d'euros sur les trois années à
            
venir. La responsabilité des Etats membres en termes de réformes mais aussi d'investissements
            
est grande. Stimuler les investissements, en termes économiques, c'est agir du côté de la
            
demande et du côté de l'offre en même temps!
            
La situation économique actuelle est compliquée puisque nous connaissons non seulement une
            
croissance économique trop faible, mais aussi une inflation exceptionnellement basse. Davantage,
            
d'ailleurs, dans les pays de la zone euro que dans les autres pays membres. Cela pèse sur les
            
dettes publiques et privées (et donc sur les investissements) – des dettes d'ailleurs qui sont déjà
            
trop élevées. Nous devons mobiliser des moyens, sans tabous, sans peur, sans obsessions, sans
            
idéologie, avec un mélange d'objectifs de court terme et de long terme et en respectant les
            
principes fondateurs de l'Union Economique et Monétaire.
            
Tout notre système socio-économique est bâti sur la croissance et l'emploi. Nous en sommes tous
            
intimement conscients. C'est pour cela, d'ailleurs que le sommet de la zone euro a demandé aux
            
""quatre présidents"" de préparer pour décembre un rapport sur une coordination économique
            
renforcée. A mon avis, c'est un pas indispensable sur le chemin vers une véritable Union
            
Economique et Monétaire – chemin que nous avions tracé dans nos rapports de 2012.
            
The European Council also discussed foreign affairs. Leaders spoke about the terrible plague of
            
Ebola, in West Africa. Thanks to substantial commitments in the immediate run-up and even during
            
the meeting, together we reached 1 billion € in pledges for the fight against Ebola. This money
            
must now be put to good use. We also appointed an Ebola coordinator for the EU: incoming
            
Commissioner Stylianides.
            
The European Council then discussed Ukraine, as it has done in all our meetings since March, and
            
as it will continue to do as long as necessary. We called upon the Russian Federation to assume
            
its responsibilities for the full implementation of the Minsk Agreement. The energy deal for the
            
winter is a positive step. The illegal so-called elections in the Donbas area a very negative one.
            
As I mentioned, this European Council was the last one which I chaired. Leaders said good-bye,
            
and for my part, I shared with them how I've always tried to act in the name of the European
            
interest. This is not something abstract. It is more than the sum of twenty-eight national interests,
            
but it is also about getting to twenty-eight.
            
Each time we have to agree, with everyone around the table. Not always ""in one go"", and
            
sometimes with a bit of pulling and shoving… But together the members of the European Council,
            
with the other institutions, have shown the implausible: that a Union with twenty-eight countries can
            
work. I'm fully aware that the next five years will be as crucial as the previous one. We need results
            
in terms of growth and jobs to regain the trust of the people of Europe.
            
These past five years, I've also tried to show that the Union's institutions can work together. I am
            
grateful for that to the previous President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso –
            
with whom I worked well together from day one until last week. And I am also most grateful to the
            
two Presidents of the European Parliament with whom I've had the pleasure and privilege to work,
            
President Buzek and President Schulz. I had many contacts with many among you.
            
Of course, we can sometimes have divergent approaches, but the institutions are in my view not
            
rivals. We serve the same cause, Europe's cause, meaning ultimately the well-being of all our
            
citizens. And I know this is what drives the work of our institutions, which are, each in their own
            
way, so close to public opinion, the European Council, and you, the European Parliament. Thank
            
you.

Speech by President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy to the 69th UN General Assembly,25-09-2014,European Council,H. van Rompuy,1775," European Council               PRESS              EN               The President              PRESS RELEASE              EUCO 188/14              PRESSE 484              PR PCE 164              New York, 25 September 2014               Herman Van Rompuy              President of the European Council              Speech to the 69th General Assembly of the United Nations               FR              Le monde est aujourd'hui bien plus dangereux que lorsque l'année passée nous étions ici réunis;              l'effroi plus fort que l’espoir. Des événements tragiques ont marqué les esprits.              Plus de deux cents jeunes filles enlevées au lycée, réduites en esclavage. Un avion de ligne –              empli de parents, d'enfants, de scientifiques, de vacanciers, de personnel de bord – fauché en              plein vol. Un peuple sur une montagne, poursuivi, pris au piège, massacré. Et la semaine dernière,              en pleine mer, un demi-millier de naufragés, victimes de passeurs assassins.              Ces sombres épisodes inquiètent, aussi en ce qu’ils semblent annoncer des mouvements plus              profonds. Nos opinions publiques craignent que le monde nous échappe, qu'il change en mal. Ce              qu'elles voient contesté, ce sont les fondements politiques mêmes de notre vivre-ensemble.              Comment l'on se comporte, entre personnes et entre Etats. Nos concitoyens voient la montée de              l'obscurantisme, de forces fanatiques, ils voient resurgir les frontières d’un monde d’hier,              d’avant-hier, d’un monde fou.              Oui, comme disait mon compatriote Paul-Henri Spaak il y a 66 ans à la tribune de cette même              assemblée, ""Nous avons peur"", ""pas la peur d'un lâche, [non,] la peur que peut avoir, (…) la peur              que doit avoir un homme quand il regarde vers l’avenir et qu’il considère tout ce qu’il y a peut-être              encore d’horreur et de tragédie, et de terribles responsabilités dans cet avenir.""              EN              When the values we share are under pressure, when the order of things seems to be unraveling,              we must act. We must 'bring back our girls' and free them from Boko Haram. We must allow the              families of the victims of flight MH17 to pay their final respects to their loved ones, and keep the              memory alive of the drowned hopefuls of the Mediterranean. And we must mobilise – all of us –              against the barbaric group that is ISIL.              Together, we can make the world a safer place again.               Dirk De Backer - Spokesperson of the President - T +32 (0)2 281 9768 - M +32 (0)497 59 99 19              Preben Aamann - Deputy Spokesperson of the President - T +32 (0)2 281 2060 - M +32 (0)476 85 05 43              press.president@consilium.europa.eu - www.european-council.europa.eu/the-president               1/4               When looking back upon the past year, for us in Europe the most bewildering act in our region was              the abrupt and illegal annexation of Crimea, this March. This violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and              territorial integrity triggered the gravest threat to the European security order in decades. It matters              beyond the European continent. It is about rejecting the use of force, about defending the rule of              law that upholds our society of nations.              Dear colleagues, this General Assembly assumed its responsibility by adopting Resolution 68/262              on the territorial integrity of Ukraine. You defended those very values the UN Charter was built              upon. The European Union welcomes this strong message that the breaking of the rules will not be              tolerated. When you tamper with borders, you tamper with peace.              The European Union stands firm in its solidarity with Ukraine; it is the Ukrainian people's right to              decide their own political destiny. Europe responded to aggression and the violation of international              law with a wide range of sanctions – political, economic and financial. We knew this could hurt our              own economies in return, but together with our international partners, we did not relent, since the              stability of the European house itself was at stake.              Now all of us must ensure the peace process launched in Minsk advances, and that all parties              respect the ceasefire and abide by the Peace Plan. The sanctions are not a goal in themselves;              and they can be revised, provided there is tangible progress. We can rebuild trust if commitments              are met.              At the same time, it is essential that Ukraine's authorities move firmly forward on the path of              reforms. Those reforms – economic, political, constitutional – will determine the success of a              lasting political solution.              The country’s political life and prosperity shall belong to all its citizens. An inclusive Ukraine, with a              new social contract and a fair balance between the parts and the whole, is the best way to secure              the country's future.              European Union countries and institutions are fully committed to supporting Ukraine along this              path. The EU-Ukraine Association Agreement – ratified just last week by the Ukrainian Rada and              the European Parliament – is a compass, an opportunity to help Ukraine transform into the              dynamic, modern and open democracy its people deserve. The steps ahead in this cooperation will              take place within the wider picture of the peace process. With Russia, our biggest neighbour, we              are ready to engage and re-establish a basis of trust, of promises kept.              There are nearly 200 countries in this world, but many thousands of minorities worldwide…Clearly,              there is no other way than inclusiveness, than respecting identities, than giving people a voice. As              a Belgian, and a European, I know it can be a real effort to stay together, it requires constant              attention, openness, empathy – a willingness to adjust. Countries do not have to break up to allow              for multiple, often multi-layered identities to co-exist. Unity in diversity can work.              The most pressing concern on all our minds today is Iraq, Syria, the wider Middle East. I needn't              sketch the bleak outlook, the sinister deeds, the unspeakable suffering in the region.              What we have seen this summer has nothing to do with Islam: it is the return of barbaric ghosts              from a long forgotten past… Horrendous deeds rejecting that we are one humankind, denying the              very basic values of civilisation.               EUCO 188/14               2/4               As the Grand Mufti of Egypt said to me two weeks ago: ISIL is abusing the name of Islam, the very              values of Islam and of every religion. I welcome the words and measures by the Arab League, the              Organisation for Islamic Cooperation, and Muslim nations against ISIL. It is essential that the              parties and neighbours most concerned are at the frontline in this common fight.              But all of us must do our share to confront and isolate ISIL. Block financial flows and weapon flows,              cut off illegal oil revenue and stop the influx of foreign fighters. European Union governments are              working hard on all these fronts.              As we know in our countries also, radicalisation can strike anywhere. Take the young jihadi fanatic              from France, who turned torturer in Syria, and – back in Europe – murdered four innocent victims –              in the Jewish Museum of my home town of Brussels. We need urgent collective action to stop              these foreign fighters from joining ISIL's ranks – as we were many to underline in yesterday’s              special Security Council session.              We also must work together to help the affected countries. Iraq’s new government, aiming for              inclusive leadership, deserves everybody's full support – and certainly has ours. But the crisis              cannot be resolved without a political solution for Syria. We owe it to the close to 200.000 victims,              to the millions who have had to flee their homes. It is quite simply a catastrophe, one of the              international community's biggest failures.              What is needed is a comprehensive regional solution; it must include, as this summer’s tragic              events in Gaza underline once again, a two-state solution with an independent, democratic, viable              Palestinian state, living side-by-side in peace with Israel and its other neighbours.              The violent dynamics are spreading instability in all directions, into the Sahel region and as far              south as Nigeria, but also to the East. These dynamics are fostering terrorism, organised crime,              arms flows, drugs trafficking, human smuggling and radicalisation – as we also see in Libya.              And I want to pay tribute to France for the efforts to help, upon their request, the governments of              Mali and of the Central African Republic restore the rule of law, and instil inclusiveness and              reconciliation – in close collaboration with the African Union, the United Nations and the whole of              the European Union.              We are ready to take our responsibility, knowing that we Europeans have no self-interested              geostrategic objectives in the area. We turned this page of history decades ago.              A collective approach is important to deal with another tragic symptom of an imploding Middle              East: dramatic migration in the Mediterranean.              We've seen millions fleeing the war in Syria, into countries like Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey;              European lifeguards rescue up to a thousand of people a week – people who are risking their lives              on small boats across the Mediterranean, looking for a life free from fear. Many come from              countries where state structures have crumbled, where violence is endemic, where people's most              basic needs cannot be met.              FR              La seule réponse durable au désespoir, c'est le développement. Je souhaite saluer l'engagement              inlassable des Nations-Unies et de leur Secrétaire Général pour promouvoir les objectifs du              développement, aussi post 2015, pour maintenir un niveau d'ambition pour nos actions à la              mesure des défis.              Et de même pour le défi climatique, où l'Europe reste engagée en première ligne et le démontrera              l'année prochaine dans les négociations de Paris. J’espère que toutes les nations – grandes et              petites, riches et pauvres – y assumeront leur responsabilité.               EUCO 188/14               3/4               La crise de l'Ebola nous rappelle cruellement comment l'avenir d'un pays dépend aussi de ses              structures de santé, que de ces dernières peut dépendre, en définitive, la santé de tous. L’Ebola              est la peste des temps modernes. Ce sont les équipes de médecins, d'infirmiers, de volontaires              qu'il faut renforcer. Et l’Europe est là, avec d’autres, pour aider, pour soulager, pour guérir.              En cet automne 2014, nous commémorons le centenaire d'un grand conflit qui fut le premier à              entraîner le monde entier dans sa spirale destructrice. Il fallut une seconde grande guerre pour              que nos Nations se ressaisissent et tentent de construire la paix ensemble, permettant              l'émergence de notre Union des Nations.              Nous avons certes, depuis, su éviter une nouvelle guerre mondiale, mais n'avons point mis un              terme à la violence entre pays ou au sein des Etats. Nous sommes réunis ici non pas pour              déplorer l'impardonnable mais pour nourrir l'espoir, réaliser l'indispensable – agir ensemble.              EN              We must overcome fear. We must overcome fear by fighting danger, by restoring justice, by              striving for peace. So that next year, when our society of nations meets again in New York, we can              say: “The spell of that dreadful summer of 2014 has been broken; step by step we are making              progress, patiently but relentlessly we reconquer a place for hope.” Thank you.

Speech to the 69th General Assembly of the United Nations
            

FR
            
Le monde est aujourd'hui bien plus dangereux que lorsque l'année passée nous étions ici réunis;
            
l'effroi plus fort que l’espoir. Des événements tragiques ont marqué les esprits.
            
Plus de deux cents jeunes filles enlevées au lycée, réduites en esclavage. Un avion de ligne –
            
empli de parents, d'enfants, de scientifiques, de vacanciers, de personnel de bord – fauché en
            
plein vol. Un peuple sur une montagne, poursuivi, pris au piège, massacré. Et la semaine dernière,
            
en pleine mer, un demi-millier de naufragés, victimes de passeurs assassins.
            
Ces sombres épisodes inquiètent, aussi en ce qu’ils semblent annoncer des mouvements plus
            
profonds. Nos opinions publiques craignent que le monde nous échappe, qu'il change en mal. Ce
            
qu'elles voient contesté, ce sont les fondements politiques mêmes de notre vivre-ensemble.
            
Comment l'on se comporte, entre personnes et entre Etats. Nos concitoyens voient la montée de
            
l'obscurantisme, de forces fanatiques, ils voient resurgir les frontières d’un monde d’hier,
            
d’avant-hier, d’un monde fou.
            
Oui, comme disait mon compatriote Paul-Henri Spaak il y a 66 ans à la tribune de cette même
            
assemblée, ""Nous avons peur"", ""pas la peur d'un lâche, [non,] la peur que peut avoir, (…) la peur
            
que doit avoir un homme quand il regarde vers l’avenir et qu’il considère tout ce qu’il y a peut-être
            
encore d’horreur et de tragédie, et de terribles responsabilités dans cet avenir.""

When the values we share are under pressure, when the order of things seems to be unraveling,
            
we must act. We must 'bring back our girls' and free them from Boko Haram. We must allow the
            
families of the victims of flight MH17 to pay their final respects to their loved ones, and keep the
            
memory alive of the drowned hopefuls of the Mediterranean. And we must mobilise – all of us –
            
against the barbaric group that is ISIL.
            
Together, we can make the world a safer place again.

When looking back upon the past year, for us in Europe the most bewildering act in our region was
            
the abrupt and illegal annexation of Crimea, this March. This violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and
            
territorial integrity triggered the gravest threat to the European security order in decades. It matters
            
beyond the European continent. It is about rejecting the use of force, about defending the rule of
            
law that upholds our society of nations.
            
Dear colleagues, this General Assembly assumed its responsibility by adopting Resolution 68/262
            
on the territorial integrity of Ukraine. You defended those very values the UN Charter was built
            
upon. The European Union welcomes this strong message that the breaking of the rules will not be
            
tolerated. When you tamper with borders, you tamper with peace.
            
The European Union stands firm in its solidarity with Ukraine; it is the Ukrainian people's right to
            
decide their own political destiny. Europe responded to aggression and the violation of international
            
law with a wide range of sanctions – political, economic and financial. We knew this could hurt our
            
own economies in return, but together with our international partners, we did not relent, since the
            
stability of the European house itself was at stake.
            
Now all of us must ensure the peace process launched in Minsk advances, and that all parties
            
respect the ceasefire and abide by the Peace Plan. The sanctions are not a goal in themselves;
            
and they can be revised, provided there is tangible progress. We can rebuild trust if commitments
            
are met.
            
At the same time, it is essential that Ukraine's authorities move firmly forward on the path of
            
reforms. Those reforms – economic, political, constitutional – will determine the success of a
            
lasting political solution.
            
The country’s political life and prosperity shall belong to all its citizens. An inclusive Ukraine, with a
            
new social contract and a fair balance between the parts and the whole, is the best way to secure
            
the country's future.
            
European Union countries and institutions are fully committed to supporting Ukraine along this
            
path. The EU-Ukraine Association Agreement – ratified just last week by the Ukrainian Rada and
            
the European Parliament – is a compass, an opportunity to help Ukraine transform into the
            
dynamic, modern and open democracy its people deserve. The steps ahead in this cooperation will
            
take place within the wider picture of the peace process. With Russia, our biggest neighbour, we
            
are ready to engage and re-establish a basis of trust, of promises kept.
            
There are nearly 200 countries in this world, but many thousands of minorities worldwide…Clearly,
            
there is no other way than inclusiveness, than respecting identities, than giving people a voice. As
            
a Belgian, and a European, I know it can be a real effort to stay together, it requires constant
            
attention, openness, empathy – a willingness to adjust. Countries do not have to break up to allow
            
for multiple, often multi-layered identities to co-exist. Unity in diversity can work.
            
The most pressing concern on all our minds today is Iraq, Syria, the wider Middle East. I needn't
            
sketch the bleak outlook, the sinister deeds, the unspeakable suffering in the region.
            
What we have seen this summer has nothing to do with Islam: it is the return of barbaric ghosts
            
from a long forgotten past… Horrendous deeds rejecting that we are one humankind, denying the
            
very basic values of civilisation.

As the Grand Mufti of Egypt said to me two weeks ago: ISIL is abusing the name of Islam, the very
            
values of Islam and of every religion. I welcome the words and measures by the Arab League, the
            
Organisation for Islamic Cooperation, and Muslim nations against ISIL. It is essential that the
            
parties and neighbours most concerned are at the frontline in this common fight.
            
But all of us must do our share to confront and isolate ISIL. Block financial flows and weapon flows,
            
cut off illegal oil revenue and stop the influx of foreign fighters. European Union governments are
            
working hard on all these fronts.
            
As we know in our countries also, radicalisation can strike anywhere. Take the young jihadi fanatic
            
from France, who turned torturer in Syria, and – back in Europe – murdered four innocent victims –
            
in the Jewish Museum of my home town of Brussels. We need urgent collective action to stop
            
these foreign fighters from joining ISIL's ranks – as we were many to underline in yesterday’s
            
special Security Council session.
            
We also must work together to help the affected countries. Iraq’s new government, aiming for
            
inclusive leadership, deserves everybody's full support – and certainly has ours. But the crisis
            
cannot be resolved without a political solution for Syria. We owe it to the close to 200.000 victims,
            
to the millions who have had to flee their homes. It is quite simply a catastrophe, one of the
            
international community's biggest failures.
            
What is needed is a comprehensive regional solution; it must include, as this summer’s tragic
            
events in Gaza underline once again, a two-state solution with an independent, democratic, viable
            
Palestinian state, living side-by-side in peace with Israel and its other neighbours.
            
The violent dynamics are spreading instability in all directions, into the Sahel region and as far
            
south as Nigeria, but also to the East. These dynamics are fostering terrorism, organised crime,
            
arms flows, drugs trafficking, human smuggling and radicalisation – as we also see in Libya.
            
And I want to pay tribute to France for the efforts to help, upon their request, the governments of
            
Mali and of the Central African Republic restore the rule of law, and instil inclusiveness and
            
reconciliation – in close collaboration with the African Union, the United Nations and the whole of
            
the European Union.
            
We are ready to take our responsibility, knowing that we Europeans have no self-interested
            
geostrategic objectives in the area. We turned this page of history decades ago.
            
A collective approach is important to deal with another tragic symptom of an imploding Middle
            
East: dramatic migration in the Mediterranean.
            
We've seen millions fleeing the war in Syria, into countries like Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey;
            
European lifeguards rescue up to a thousand of people a week – people who are risking their lives
            
on small boats across the Mediterranean, looking for a life free from fear. Many come from
            
countries where state structures have crumbled, where violence is endemic, where people's most
            
basic needs cannot be met.

La seule réponse durable au désespoir, c'est le développement. Je souhaite saluer l'engagement
            
inlassable des Nations-Unies et de leur Secrétaire Général pour promouvoir les objectifs du
            
développement, aussi post 2015, pour maintenir un niveau d'ambition pour nos actions à la
            
mesure des défis.
            
Et de même pour le défi climatique, où l'Europe reste engagée en première ligne et le démontrera
            
l'année prochaine dans les négociations de Paris. J’espère que toutes les nations – grandes et
            
petites, riches et pauvres – y assumeront leur responsabilité.

La crise de l'Ebola nous rappelle cruellement comment l'avenir d'un pays dépend aussi de ses
            
structures de santé, que de ces dernières peut dépendre, en définitive, la santé de tous. L’Ebola
            
est la peste des temps modernes. Ce sont les équipes de médecins, d'infirmiers, de volontaires
            
qu'il faut renforcer. Et l’Europe est là, avec d’autres, pour aider, pour soulager, pour guérir.
            
En cet automne 2014, nous commémorons le centenaire d'un grand conflit qui fut le premier à
            
entraîner le monde entier dans sa spirale destructrice. Il fallut une seconde grande guerre pour
            
que nos Nations se ressaisissent et tentent de construire la paix ensemble, permettant
            
l'émergence de notre Union des Nations.
            
Nous avons certes, depuis, su éviter une nouvelle guerre mondiale, mais n'avons point mis un
            
terme à la violence entre pays ou au sein des Etats. Nous sommes réunis ici non pas pour
            
déplorer l'impardonnable mais pour nourrir l'espoir, réaliser l'indispensable – agir ensemble.

We must overcome fear. We must overcome fear by fighting danger, by restoring justice, by
            
striving for peace. So that next year, when our society of nations meets again in New York, we can
            
say: “The spell of that dreadful summer of 2014 has been broken; step by step we are making
            
progress, patiently but relentlessly we reconquer a place for hope.” Thank you.

I was fascinated by his intelligence,              his political skills, his imagination already over 40 years ago. Although I appreciated his              predecessors as Prime Minister a lot, I still consider him the most important Prime Minister since              Gaston Eyskens left office in 1972. Et le meilleur Président que la Commission européenne n’a              jamais eu! He had a completely different public image compared to who he really was: a listener, a              man of empathy, a long cry away from the bulldozer reputation. In the last period of his career the              public at large recognized how a genuine he was, and rewarded him with respect and popularity.              He assumed political responsibilities at local, federal and European level, as mayor and as              minister, as Premier and as MEP. ""All politics is local"" – a case in point. Intellectually and from              experience, he was well placed to make the synthesis. And he did.              He once made a brilliant comparison between Belgium many reforms of the State and the              successive EU treaty changes. One of the surprising conclusions is not that both are ""work in              progress"" but that in both cases the end goal, the terminus ad quem was not clear and even not              really needed provided that we kept to the right direction, meaning more federalism in Belgium and              ""more Europe"". He was a pragmatist. This is not the opposite of principled. Not at all. This means              that one acknowledge that we are ready to meet and overcome obstacles, that that takes time, that              there are side-path and crossroads. A pragmatist is the opposite of an opportunist.              Jean-Luc was a great European. He proved that during his premiership as member of the              European Council, as vice-president of the Convention and as Europarliamentarian. His European              convictions were in line with the Belgian traditional view on European integration. He said in              interviews that the way I assumed my role as PEC was precisely what the Convention had in mind.              On my birthday in 2012 he send me a text message : ""Goed bezig"" (well done) and a year later              when I received the Charlemagne Prize : ""Dubbel en dik verdiend"" (well deserved). Coming from              him, it made me proud. He never was a real parliamentarian in his own country. On the contrary.              But he became a convinced defender and promoter of the European Parliament.

Zelfs niet dat hij voorzitter              was van de Raad van Bestuur van het Europacollege. Wij zijn hier omdat we niet alleen een groot              man maar een grote vriend verloren. We hoefden daarvoor zelfs mekaar niet vaak te zien. Dat              laatste zullen we nooit meer kunnen. Er rest ons alleen de herinnering en de erfenis. Voor mij en              anderen de steeds weerkerende vraag bij elk probleem "" Wat zou Jean-Luc ervan gedacht              hebben? Wat zou hij eraan gedaan hebben ?"" Die vragen blijven voor immer.              Het is een zeer goed initiatief van het Europacollege om ons hier bijeen te brengen, en ons de              kans te geven dat hier te zeggen.              All that I have said so far still doesn't explain why we are gathered here today. Even if Jean-Luc              used to be Chairman of the Board of Directors of the College of Europe. The reason we are here is              that we have lost not only a great man but a great friend. For that, we didn't even have to see each              other that often. And now, we will never be able to again. We are left with the memories, his              legacy. For me and for others, the ever returning question to every problem will always be ""what              would Jean-Luc have thought about it? what would he have done?"" These questions are forever.              It is a very good initiative by Madariaga to bring us together allowing us to say this here today.

successive EU treaty changes. One of the surprising conclusions is not that both are ""work in
            
progress"" but that in both cases the end goal, the terminus ad quem was not clear and even not
            
really needed provided that we kept to the right direction, meaning more federalism in Belgium and
            
""more Europe"". He was a pragmatist. This is not the opposite of principled. Not at all. This means
            
that one acknowledge that we are ready to meet and overcome obstacles, that that takes time, that
            
there are side-path and crossroads. A pragmatist is the opposite of an opportunist.
            
Jean-Luc was a great European. He proved that during his premiership as member of the
            
European Council, as vice-president of the Convention and as Europarliamentarian. His European
            
convictions were in line with the Belgian traditional view on European integration. He said in
            
interviews that the way I assumed my role as PEC was precisely what the Convention had in mind.
            
On my birthday in 2012 he send me a text message : ""Goed bezig"" (well done) and a year later
            
when I received the Charlemagne Prize : ""Dubbel en dik verdiend"" (well deserved). Coming from
            
him, it made me proud. He never was a real parliamentarian in his own country. On the contrary.
            
But he became a convinced defender and promoter of the European Parliament.

Maar dat alles verklaart nog niet waarom we hier vandaag bijeen zijn. Zelfs niet dat hij voorzitter
            
was van de Raad van Bestuur van het Europacollege. Wij zijn hier omdat we niet alleen een groot
            
man maar een grote vriend verloren. We hoefden daarvoor zelfs mekaar niet vaak te zien. Dat
            
laatste zullen we nooit meer kunnen. Er rest ons alleen de herinnering en de erfenis. Voor mij en
            
anderen de steeds weerkerende vraag bij elk probleem "" Wat zou Jean-Luc ervan gedacht
            
hebben? Wat zou hij eraan gedaan hebben ?"" Die vragen blijven voor immer.
            
Het is een zeer goed initiatief van het Europacollege om ons hier bijeen te brengen, en ons de
            
kans te geven dat hier te zeggen.
            
All that I have said so far still doesn't explain why we are gathered here today. Even if Jean-Luc
            
used to be Chairman of the Board of Directors of the College of Europe. The reason we are here is
            
that we have lost not only a great man but a great friend. For that, we didn't even have to see each
            
other that often. And now, we will never be able to again. We are left with the memories, his
            
legacy. For me and for others, the ever returning question to every problem will always be ""what
            
would Jean-Luc have thought about it? what would he have done?"" These questions are forever.
            
It is a very good initiative by Madariaga to bring us together allowing us to say this here today.

Lassen Sie mich danken Herrn Linden und dem Preisdirektorium für diese große              Auszeichnung. Ich bin auch Oberbürgermeister Philipp dankbar für seine wohlwollenden              Worte, und den Aachener Bürgern für den Empfang hier in ihrem Rathaus.              Wo wir uns jetzt befinden, stand einst die Burg Karls-des-Großen...              Immer wenn ich diesen Ort besuche, überwältigt mich der Gedanke an die zwölfhundert              Jahre fortlaufender Geschichte. Heute aber ganz besonders.              Die Stadt Aachen besitzt aufgrund dieses Erbes ein großes Geschichtsbewusstsein…              Geschichte, nicht als lähmender Schatten der Vergangenheit, sondern als ständige Aufruf,              dass wir selbst für die Gestaltung unserer Zukunft verantwortlich sind.              Deshalb haben Sie 1949 den Karlspreis gegründet. Als unsere Länder in Trümmern lagen,              war Aachen in der Lage, als Kaiserstadt und Grenzstadt, über die Grenzen der              Nationalstaaten hinauszusehen.              Sie haben es gewagt, einen Neuanfang zu verkünden – 'Europa'.              (EN)              And who could better symbolise Franco-German reconciliation than Charlemagne ? The              pater Europae was the last to govern over Franks and Germans as one nation – before the              continent was divided into three by his grandsons, in Verdun in 843. What followed was              endless centuries of violence, all the way to the horrendous battle in that same Verdun, in              1916 (and beyond)…              In a way, European unification was nothing but undoing the initial Treaty of Verdun! But              unlike in Carolingian days, this time not by force but by choice.               EUCO 120/14               2               E /DE               After the wars, for many in West-Germany and many elsewhere, 'Europe' was a way to              again write their own history. In the words of Karlspreisgründer Dr. Kurt Pfeiffer, nothing              was more urgent than to fight the notion ''dass gegen den Zwangsablauf der Geschichte              nichts getan werden könne und alles Mühen schon bereits von vornherein zum Scheitern              verurteilt sei.''              Perhaps our present time is another such moment – where we must fight the idea of              powerlessness in the face of history. I will come back to that.              Before I continue, let me salute the Karlspreisträger who have returned to Aachen for this              occasion. Their extraordinary European lives, and those of their predecessors, tell the story              of our continent's implausible post-war unification.              It so happens that I was working for the great Belgian Prime Minister Leo Tindemans              when he received the Charlemagne Prize. I was twenty-eight at the time, and the emotion,              the excitement even, that surrounded the announcement have stayed with me ever since.              Tindemans had just penned his 1975 report on Europe. He was a firm believer in the              generosity of the European idea, 'ein edler Gedanke', and my political mentor, also in this.              Today, my thoughts go also to two of my other predecessors as Belgian Prime Ministers,              Jean-Luc Dehaene and Wilfried Martens. Both passed away this past year. They too, saw              European unity as the greatest undertaking of our time, and dedicated their lives to it. I              salute their memory.              This prize goes beyond me personally. I see it as a recognition of the courageous work of              European leaders and all European institutions to combat the existential threat of the              financial crisis.              Wie Karlspreis-rägerin Angela Merkel einmal sagte: “scheitert der Euro dann scheitert              Europa”.              It was the worst ever threat to Europe's unity, and together we have overcome it. We have              won the battle.              As European Council President, I considered it from the very start my responsibility to act              as the guardian of trust among the leaders. Trust is the basis for difficult decisions, an              invaluable asset when you need to reach decisions at twenty-eight. However fragile it may              have seemed at times from the outside, the sense of duty never wavered around the leaders'              table. All fought to preserve the single currency, with solidarity, with responsibility.              During these trying moments (perhaps because of them), the European Council played its              role to the full. Not meddling into the Union's day-to-day work, but springing into action              when required: to set priorities, cut knots, deal with crises.               EUCO 120/14               3               E /DE               As the institution's first permanent president, I should like to thank all the people serving              the institution in all possible functions, for their work: they too have helped shape this new              office.              The European Council and its regular summits make very visible that the Union is not just              Brussels, but 28 nations, intensely working together. And that what happens in every single              one of these countries – economically, socially, politically – matters hugely to the others.              So is the reality of our interdependence today.              For people across Europe, these years of shared toiling have made it clear: Europapolitik              ist Innenpolitik.              It is a new phase in our long journey.              As the European Union stands on the eve of political renewal, it is important to look ahead.              From economic shocks to demographic shifts and climate trends – in a hypercompetitive              world, we must concentrate on the right priorities. The list stands clearly before us: jobs              and recovery, deepening the monetary union, climate and energy, freedoms and security,              Europe’s action in the world. But I will not elaborate these themes; there are other places              for that.              In the moments we have together, I want to address another important issue: the way              people experience and relate to the European Union. At a time of public doubt, it is              perhaps a deeper challenge.              We just heard three powerful reminders of Europe’s promise – peace and democracy,              prosperity and solidarity, a civilised and sovereign life as a nation.              I want to warmly thank the Prime Ministers of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine for              accepting the invitation to come to Aachen – at such a tumultuous time for their region –,              and I salute their courage, your courage.              The situation for your countries is on all our minds. Destabilisation by our common              neighbour Russia is unacceptable, and all the more regrettable since, at heart, this great              country fully belongs to the European civilisation, to European culture. Without              Shakespeare or Balzac, there would be no Dostoyevsky as we know him, without Gogol,              no Kafka, without Tolstoy, no Thomas Mann.              For the countries of the European Union, there is no nostalgia of a 'glorious' past that will              never return, no border ambitions at the expense of neighbours, no cycles of defeat and              revenge – all member states have now turned that page and look with confidence to the              future.               EUCO 120/14               4               E /DE               Today you have spoken of what Europe means to you, to your countries. To everyone in              this room, as to me, your strong words were a precious reminder, a valuable gift.              Multumesc, Mahd-lobt. Dyakuyu. Thank you!              Isn't it striking that the European Union seems somehow more popular today outside its              borders than within?              More and more, we see how the very opportunities and liberties that we Europeans hold,              and that others are striving for, are being put into question.              This indeed is the crucial challenge: the way people perceive and relate to the Union.              How is it possible that people now see Europe as a reason they feel powerless and without              a say – whereas it was precisely conceived to make them stronger and regain a grip on              their own history?              In response to this feeling, some call for 'more' Europe and some for 'less' – some even              want a bit of both, depending on the issue. Hence perhaps the mix of reluctance and              expectation, a mix that was also at work in last week's European elections.              These are vast questions of course. But I would like in particular to make one              underestimated point.              It is about the way our Union is above all experienced by people as a space and hardly ever              as a place. Let me explain. Space and place are really not the same thing.              A place – ein Ort – brings protection, stability and belonging. It is ein Heim, where people              feel at home. A space on the other hand – ein Raum – opens up movement and              possibilities. It is about direction, speed and time.              As human beings, we need both. A space in which to fly, and a nest we can call ours. We              are very simple creatures!              With Europe, the focus has always been on space. Think about it.              From the very start, the typical action was to remove borders, for goods, workers,              investment, to let people and companies move, take initiatives, seize opportunities. Even              today – on fields as diverse as energy, telecom or the digital economy – it is still about              bringing down borders, creating this big common space.               EUCO 120/14               5               E /DE               But we've never really thought of Europe as a home, a shelter, and today we pay a price for              it. For decades it worked well. The open borders brought huge opportunities, for working,              trading, studying abroad. And the impact of all the opening was mostly cushioned – by              economic growth, and by the welfare states, set up in parallel.              For instance in my own region, Flanders, in the thirteen years between my entering high              school and my leaving university, prosperity doubled. Poland, to take another example,              which was as rich per capita as Ukraine when the Iron Curtain fell, is now at least three              times richer.              Crucially, the division of labour through all these years was that Europe opened, and              national governments protected. Nobody expected otherwise.              But things have changed. Globalisation has put the welfare states under strain. The crisis              forced European Union institutions into a new role.              The result is a dramatic and rapid shift: whereas for decades Europe had been all about              opening, liberating, unlocking, emancipating, empowering... today it is suddenly seen as              meddling, judging, prescribing, dictating, correcting, even punishing… Europe, the great              'opener' of opportunities is now perceived by many as an unwelcome 'intruder', the friend              of freedom and space is seen as threat to protection and place. We need to get the balance              right. It is essential for the Union to be also on the protecting side.              It is urgent for the Union not to be seen as only benefiting businesses, but also employees;              not only the ''movers'', but also the ''stayers''; not only those with diplomas and language              skills, but all citizens; and people not only as consumers, who like cheap products and a              wide choice, but also as workers, who can see in others, competitors for their jobs.              How to get this balance right? When it comes to protection, people expect two things from              the European Union.              First, for problems that individual countries are clearly not big enough to fight on their              own, that the Union steps in. Second, where national authorities are best-placed to provide              care, that the Union does not get in the way.              Where people really want Europe to defend their interests and keep threats at bay, is on              global and cross-border issues.              Like reckless financial speculation, which is why we are building a banking union and              closing the net on international tax evasion. Or threats like Internet abuse, social dumping,              gas oligarchs – all issues where Europe stands its ground, and is stepping up its efforts.               EUCO 120/14               6               E /DE               Protecting does not mean retreating behind our borders. It does not mean commercial              protectionism either. Part of it is precisely working with other countries abroad, to solve              problems – like instability, lawlessness, or illegal immigration. This is Europe at work as a              protector – on issues where its size makes a real difference. Scale matters. But there are              other cases, where precisely because of its scale, the Union must tread softly.              Not disrupt, but respect familiar places of protection and belonging – from national welfare              choices, to regional traditions and identities, all the way down to local cheese.              Knowing when to act as a Union, and when not to, is a difficult balance. It must be the              outcome of a conversation, since preserving that balance is a collective work. People              expect sensible rules, fairly applied, and a fight against abuses.              And to me, overall, the citizen's message to the Union IS clear: be stronger outside, be              more caring inside.              (DE)              Mehr Stärke nach außen zeigen, und mehr Behutsamkeit nach innen: das ist die              gemeinsame Aufgabe, der sich alle Institutionen und alle Regierungen heute stellen              müssen.              Es wird nicht leicht sein, aber es ist wichtig: Die Menschen müssen sich in unserer Union              zu Hause fühlen. Europa darf nicht nur ein großer Raum der Freizügigkeit und Freiheiten              sein, sondern es muss auch ein Ort sein, der Heimat ist.              Ich bin davon überzeugt, dass wir das schaffen können.              Dieses Jahr 2014, in dem wir der schrecklichen Ereignisse vor hundert Jahren gedenken,              erinnert uns daran: Alles steht und fällt natürlich mit Frieden. Ohne Frieden wird niemand              sein Glück machen oder ein Zuhause finden!              But feeling at home in the Union will also require a sense of that little extra, that              supplément d'âme which characterises Europe. Beyond striving for peace, prosperity or              power, it is also about culture, identity, destiny…              When I was sixteen years old, I remember reading a definition of culture quoted in an              essay by Paul-Henri Spaak who incidentally, with Tindemans, until today was the other              Belgian Karlspreis-winner:''Culture"" – he said – ""is what remains, once you have forgotten              all the rest.'' Once you reach the core. That hard core of European civilisation – you will              find it anywhere on our continent.               EUCO 120/14               7               E /DE               (EN)              But Europe is also a certain idea of ''der Mensch'', or the person. As Arthur Koestler wrote:              a person is infinitely more than one million divided by one million. Each person counts.              This is the core value of our great civilisation, worthy of protection; this is Europe’s              message to the world.              Thank you. Vielen Dank.

(...) Ich fühle mich sehr geehrt.
            
Lassen Sie mich danken Herrn Linden und dem Preisdirektorium für diese große
            
Auszeichnung. Ich bin auch Oberbürgermeister Philipp dankbar für seine wohlwollenden
            
Worte, und den Aachener Bürgern für den Empfang hier in ihrem Rathaus.
            
Wo wir uns jetzt befinden, stand einst die Burg Karls-des-Großen...
            
Immer wenn ich diesen Ort besuche, überwältigt mich der Gedanke an die zwölfhundert
            
Jahre fortlaufender Geschichte. Heute aber ganz besonders.
            
Die Stadt Aachen besitzt aufgrund dieses Erbes ein großes Geschichtsbewusstsein…
            
Geschichte, nicht als lähmender Schatten der Vergangenheit, sondern als ständige Aufruf,
            
dass wir selbst für die Gestaltung unserer Zukunft verantwortlich sind.
            
Deshalb haben Sie 1949 den Karlspreis gegründet. Als unsere Länder in Trümmern lagen,
            
war Aachen in der Lage, als Kaiserstadt und Grenzstadt, über die Grenzen der
            
Nationalstaaten hinauszusehen.
            
Sie haben es gewagt, einen Neuanfang zu verkünden – 'Europa'.
            
(EN)
            
And who could better symbolise Franco-German reconciliation than Charlemagne ? The
            
pater Europae was the last to govern over Franks and Germans as one nation – before the
            
continent was divided into three by his grandsons, in Verdun in 843. What followed was
            
endless centuries of violence, all the way to the horrendous battle in that same Verdun, in
            
1916 (and beyond)…
            
In a way, European unification was nothing but undoing the initial Treaty of Verdun! But
            
unlike in Carolingian days, this time not by force but by choice.

After the wars, for many in West-Germany and many elsewhere, 'Europe' was a way to
            
again write their own history. In the words of Karlspreisgründer Dr. Kurt Pfeiffer, nothing
            
was more urgent than to fight the notion ''dass gegen den Zwangsablauf der Geschichte
            
nichts getan werden könne und alles Mühen schon bereits von vornherein zum Scheitern
            
verurteilt sei.''
            
Perhaps our present time is another such moment – where we must fight the idea of
            
powerlessness in the face of history. I will come back to that.
            
Before I continue, let me salute the Karlspreisträger who have returned to Aachen for this
            
occasion. Their extraordinary European lives, and those of their predecessors, tell the story
            
of our continent's implausible post-war unification.
            
It so happens that I was working for the great Belgian Prime Minister Leo Tindemans
            
when he received the Charlemagne Prize. I was twenty-eight at the time, and the emotion,
            
the excitement even, that surrounded the announcement have stayed with me ever since.
            
Tindemans had just penned his 1975 report on Europe. He was a firm believer in the
            
generosity of the European idea, 'ein edler Gedanke', and my political mentor, also in this.
            
Today, my thoughts go also to two of my other predecessors as Belgian Prime Ministers,
            
Jean-Luc Dehaene and Wilfried Martens. Both passed away this past year. They too, saw
            
European unity as the greatest undertaking of our time, and dedicated their lives to it. I
            
salute their memory.
            
This prize goes beyond me personally. I see it as a recognition of the courageous work of
            
European leaders and all European institutions to combat the existential threat of the
            
financial crisis.
            
Wie Karlspreis-rägerin Angela Merkel einmal sagte: “scheitert der Euro dann scheitert
            
Europa”.
            
It was the worst ever threat to Europe's unity, and together we have overcome it. We have
            
won the battle.
            
As European Council President, I considered it from the very start my responsibility to act
            
as the guardian of trust among the leaders. Trust is the basis for difficult decisions, an
            
invaluable asset when you need to reach decisions at twenty-eight. However fragile it may
            
have seemed at times from the outside, the sense of duty never wavered around the leaders'
            
table. All fought to preserve the single currency, with solidarity, with responsibility.
            
During these trying moments (perhaps because of them), the European Council played its
            
role to the full. Not meddling into the Union's day-to-day work, but springing into action
            
when required: to set priorities, cut knots, deal with crises.

As the institution's first permanent president, I should like to thank all the people serving
            
the institution in all possible functions, for their work: they too have helped shape this new
            
office.
            
The European Council and its regular summits make very visible that the Union is not just
            
Brussels, but 28 nations, intensely working together. And that what happens in every single
            
one of these countries – economically, socially, politically – matters hugely to the others.
            
So is the reality of our interdependence today.
            
For people across Europe, these years of shared toiling have made it clear: Europapolitik
            
ist Innenpolitik.
            
It is a new phase in our long journey.
            
As the European Union stands on the eve of political renewal, it is important to look ahead.
            
From economic shocks to demographic shifts and climate trends – in a hypercompetitive
            
world, we must concentrate on the right priorities. The list stands clearly before us: jobs
            
and recovery, deepening the monetary union, climate and energy, freedoms and security,
            
Europe’s action in the world. But I will not elaborate these themes; there are other places
            
for that.
            
In the moments we have together, I want to address another important issue: the way
            
people experience and relate to the European Union. At a time of public doubt, it is
            
perhaps a deeper challenge.
            
We just heard three powerful reminders of Europe’s promise – peace and democracy,
            
prosperity and solidarity, a civilised and sovereign life as a nation.
            
I want to warmly thank the Prime Ministers of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine for
            
accepting the invitation to come to Aachen – at such a tumultuous time for their region –,
            
and I salute their courage, your courage.
            
The situation for your countries is on all our minds. Destabilisation by our common
            
neighbour Russia is unacceptable, and all the more regrettable since, at heart, this great
            
country fully belongs to the European civilisation, to European culture. Without
            
Shakespeare or Balzac, there would be no Dostoyevsky as we know him, without Gogol,
            
no Kafka, without Tolstoy, no Thomas Mann.
            
For the countries of the European Union, there is no nostalgia of a 'glorious' past that will
            
never return, no border ambitions at the expense of neighbours, no cycles of defeat and
            
revenge – all member states have now turned that page and look with confidence to the
            
future.

Today you have spoken of what Europe means to you, to your countries. To everyone in
            
this room, as to me, your strong words were a precious reminder, a valuable gift.
            
Multumesc, Mahd-lobt. Dyakuyu. Thank you!
            
Isn't it striking that the European Union seems somehow more popular today outside its
            
borders than within?
            
More and more, we see how the very opportunities and liberties that we Europeans hold,
            
and that others are striving for, are being put into question.
            
This indeed is the crucial challenge: the way people perceive and relate to the Union.
            
How is it possible that people now see Europe as a reason they feel powerless and without
            
a say – whereas it was precisely conceived to make them stronger and regain a grip on
            
their own history?
            
In response to this feeling, some call for 'more' Europe and some for 'less' – some even
            
want a bit of both, depending on the issue. Hence perhaps the mix of reluctance and
            
expectation, a mix that was also at work in last week's European elections.
            
These are vast questions of course. But I would like in particular to make one
            
underestimated point.
            
It is about the way our Union is above all experienced by people as a space and hardly ever
            
as a place. Let me explain. Space and place are really not the same thing.
            
A place – ein Ort – brings protection, stability and belonging. It is ein Heim, where people
            
feel at home. A space on the other hand – ein Raum – opens up movement and
            
possibilities. It is about direction, speed and time.
            
As human beings, we need both. A space in which to fly, and a nest we can call ours. We
            
are very simple creatures!
            
With Europe, the focus has always been on space. Think about it.
            
From the very start, the typical action was to remove borders, for goods, workers,
            
investment, to let people and companies move, take initiatives, seize opportunities. Even
            
today – on fields as diverse as energy, telecom or the digital economy – it is still about
            
bringing down borders, creating this big common space.

But we've never really thought of Europe as a home, a shelter, and today we pay a price for
            
it. For decades it worked well. The open borders brought huge opportunities, for working,
            
trading, studying abroad. And the impact of all the opening was mostly cushioned – by
            
economic growth, and by the welfare states, set up in parallel.
            
For instance in my own region, Flanders, in the thirteen years between my entering high
            
school and my leaving university, prosperity doubled. Poland, to take another example,
            
which was as rich per capita as Ukraine when the Iron Curtain fell, is now at least three
            
times richer.
            
Crucially, the division of labour through all these years was that Europe opened, and
            
national governments protected. Nobody expected otherwise.
            
But things have changed. Globalisation has put the welfare states under strain. The crisis
            
forced European Union institutions into a new role.
            
The result is a dramatic and rapid shift: whereas for decades Europe had been all about
            
opening, liberating, unlocking, emancipating, empowering... today it is suddenly seen as
            
meddling, judging, prescribing, dictating, correcting, even punishing… Europe, the great
            
'opener' of opportunities is now perceived by many as an unwelcome 'intruder', the friend
            
of freedom and space is seen as threat to protection and place. We need to get the balance
            
right. It is essential for the Union to be also on the protecting side.
            
It is urgent for the Union not to be seen as only benefiting businesses, but also employees;
            
not only the ''movers'', but also the ''stayers''; not only those with diplomas and language
            
skills, but all citizens; and people not only as consumers, who like cheap products and a
            
wide choice, but also as workers, who can see in others, competitors for their jobs.
            
How to get this balance right? When it comes to protection, people expect two things from
            
the European Union.
            
First, for problems that individual countries are clearly not big enough to fight on their
            
own, that the Union steps in. Second, where national authorities are best-placed to provide
            
care, that the Union does not get in the way.
            
Where people really want Europe to defend their interests and keep threats at bay, is on
            
global and cross-border issues.
            
Like reckless financial speculation, which is why we are building a banking union and
            
closing the net on international tax evasion. Or threats like Internet abuse, social dumping,
            
gas oligarchs – all issues where Europe stands its ground, and is stepping up its efforts.

Protecting does not mean retreating behind our borders. It does not mean commercial
            
protectionism either. Part of it is precisely working with other countries abroad, to solve
            
problems – like instability, lawlessness, or illegal immigration. This is Europe at work as a
            
protector – on issues where its size makes a real difference. Scale matters. But there are
            
other cases, where precisely because of its scale, the Union must tread softly.
            
Not disrupt, but respect familiar places of protection and belonging – from national welfare
            
choices, to regional traditions and identities, all the way down to local cheese.
            
Knowing when to act as a Union, and when not to, is a difficult balance. It must be the
            
outcome of a conversation, since preserving that balance is a collective work. People
            
expect sensible rules, fairly applied, and a fight against abuses.
            
And to me, overall, the citizen's message to the Union IS clear: be stronger outside, be
            
more caring inside.
            
(DE)
            
Mehr Stärke nach außen zeigen, und mehr Behutsamkeit nach innen: das ist die
            
gemeinsame Aufgabe, der sich alle Institutionen und alle Regierungen heute stellen
            
müssen.
            
Es wird nicht leicht sein, aber es ist wichtig: Die Menschen müssen sich in unserer Union
            
zu Hause fühlen. Europa darf nicht nur ein großer Raum der Freizügigkeit und Freiheiten
            
sein, sondern es muss auch ein Ort sein, der Heimat ist.
            
Ich bin davon überzeugt, dass wir das schaffen können.
            
Dieses Jahr 2014, in dem wir der schrecklichen Ereignisse vor hundert Jahren gedenken,
            
erinnert uns daran: Alles steht und fällt natürlich mit Frieden. Ohne Frieden wird niemand
            
sein Glück machen oder ein Zuhause finden!
            
But feeling at home in the Union will also require a sense of that little extra, that
            
supplément d'âme which characterises Europe. Beyond striving for peace, prosperity or
            
power, it is also about culture, identity, destiny…
            
When I was sixteen years old, I remember reading a definition of culture quoted in an
            
essay by Paul-Henri Spaak who incidentally, with Tindemans, until today was the other
            
Belgian Karlspreis-winner:''Culture"" – he said – ""is what remains, once you have forgotten
            
all the rest.'' Once you reach the core. That hard core of European civilisation – you will
            
find it anywhere on our continent.

But Europe is also a certain idea of ''der Mensch'', or the person. As Arthur Koestler wrote:
            
a person is infinitely more than one million divided by one million. Each person counts.
            
This is the core value of our great civilisation, worthy of protection; this is Europe’s
            
message to the world.

Deuxièmement, pour ou contre une Europe responsable et              solidaire, ou une Europe divisée et polarisée. Ce choix, nous l'avons fait tout au début de la              crise.              Nous nous sommes battus pour la stabilité de l'eurozone dans son entièreté, et cette              bataille, nous l'avons gagnée. Sans cette victoire, aujourd'hui, nous ne serions pas en              récession mais en dépression, et ce pas dans quelques pays mais dans tous nos pays. Sans              monnaie commune, le marché commun serait en danger, et donc l'Union européenne ellemême serait en danger.              Nous avons énormément travaillé au Conseil européen avec les Etats membres, au              Parlement européen et avec la Commission, pour parvenir à bannir les doutes existentiels              qui menaçaient l'eurozone. Certains de nos Etats Membres, certains de nos collègues              Premier ministres et Présidents ont fait preuve d'un courage exceptionnel. Je leur rends              hommage, et tous nous sommes très reconnaissants. Ils ont sauvé leurs pays et l'Union.              Mais les efforts ont été durs. Il fallait corriger les erreurs graves du passé. Il fallait              réorienter et réformer les économies. Même sans l'euro, tout cela (ou presque) aurait été              inévitable et nécessaire. Actuellement, les perspectives pour l'emploi et l'économie              s'ouvrent de nouveau, la croissance est de retour, plus lentement qu'espérée mais plus forte              que prévue les mois précédents. Il faut maintenir le cap.

Il y a de l'espoir après tant d'années de souffrance.              I should like to pay particular hommage to Ireland and its Taoiseach for the results              obtained. Ireland is an example for us all. Notre stratégie, leur stratégie était la bonne pour              préserver l'avenir. Parce que nous avons adopté une approche à long terme. Nous avons              résisté à ceux qui voulaient combattre une crise de la dette souveraine par une              augmentation de la dette, par des déficits publics.              Europe is stronger now than five years ago. The eurozone is more integrated. But we have              to do a lot more to bring down structural employment and poverty. Both were already too              high before the financial crisis – in some countries already in the nineties.              We managed to save the eurozone and the Union itself from collapse, but we cannot miss              that other rendez-vous with history: a Europe that is more socially coherent, with fewer              inequalities, with more lasting jobs. A Europe sufficiently resilient economically to finance              the social models that the world envies us. A fair Europe. A continent less fractured and              happier than it is today. A Europe not dominated by fear, by hate-mongering, by              intolerance –– but by hope, by solidarity, and understanding. We need a joint effort by the              European institutions and by the Member States to further build this Europe, our Europe.              We live in a dangerous world, where a united, determined Union is greatly needed.              The people of Ukraine made a decisive choice in favour of our European values. It was and              is a choice for a civilisation. They are on the right side of history, and all of us here today              pay tribute to those who have died or were wounded for that cause, our common cause.              And it reminds me of what Abraham Lincoln said in his famous speech in Gettysburg that              we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation, under              God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people,              for the people, shall not perish from the earth.              The people of Ukraine refused to live any longer in a culture of lies, bribes, manipulation,              blackmail and poverty. We must support them on the road that they have chosen, also in              these dangerous days. We cannot forget our friends in Georgia and Moldova who also              crossed the river. The countries of the Union want to live in peace with all countries on our              continent. We stand ready to cooperate more closely with those who share this choice.              The old world of before 1990, before the fall of the Berlin wall has vanished, forever, it              should never come back as we made clear in our European Council of yesterday. We are              on the side of those who want to share a society based on democracy, on justice.              That is why we gave our support to African countries. Not because it was in our economic              interest, but because we share a common enemy: extremism, polarisation , intolerance,              terrorism. The Union is the biggest donor of development aid in the world. Let's be proud              of that, our Europe is a generous Europe.               EUCO 56/14               2               E               Of course from time to time we failed. Of course we were not always coherent or not              always sufficiently united, but a new Europe is being shown to the world.              I know this may sound strange in a growing euro-negative climate, but we have good              reasons to hope. Not because we are resorting to the pep-talk so common to election              campaigns. No – because we have arguments for hope.              And let us speak up for Europe, let us use words of confidence and words of determination.              We are not a lost continent and let there not be a lost generation. History is made by men              and women. And the men and women of Europe can and will build a better future.

Herman Van Rompuy
            
Speech at the European People's Party Congress (extracts)
            
Le 25 mai, les électeurs seront appelés à faire un choix: premièrement, pour ou contre le
            
projet européen en tant que tel. Deuxièmement, pour ou contre une Europe responsable et
            
solidaire, ou une Europe divisée et polarisée. Ce choix, nous l'avons fait tout au début de la
            
crise.
            
Nous nous sommes battus pour la stabilité de l'eurozone dans son entièreté, et cette
            
bataille, nous l'avons gagnée. Sans cette victoire, aujourd'hui, nous ne serions pas en
            
récession mais en dépression, et ce pas dans quelques pays mais dans tous nos pays. Sans
            
monnaie commune, le marché commun serait en danger, et donc l'Union européenne ellemême serait en danger.
            
Nous avons énormément travaillé au Conseil européen avec les Etats membres, au
            
Parlement européen et avec la Commission, pour parvenir à bannir les doutes existentiels
            
qui menaçaient l'eurozone. Certains de nos Etats Membres, certains de nos collègues
            
Premier ministres et Présidents ont fait preuve d'un courage exceptionnel. Je leur rends
            
hommage, et tous nous sommes très reconnaissants. Ils ont sauvé leurs pays et l'Union.
            
Mais les efforts ont été durs. Il fallait corriger les erreurs graves du passé. Il fallait
            
réorienter et réformer les économies. Même sans l'euro, tout cela (ou presque) aurait été
            
inévitable et nécessaire. Actuellement, les perspectives pour l'emploi et l'économie
            
s'ouvrent de nouveau, la croissance est de retour, plus lentement qu'espérée mais plus forte
            
que prévue les mois précédents. Il faut maintenir le cap.

Il y aura de nouvelles mesures à impact direct, notamment pour promouvoir l'emploi des
            
jeunes et donner du souffle aux PME qui dans certains pays souffrent d'un défaut de crédit.
            
Il y a de l'espoir après tant d'années de souffrance.
            
I should like to pay particular hommage to Ireland and its Taoiseach for the results
            
obtained. Ireland is an example for us all. Notre stratégie, leur stratégie était la bonne pour
            
préserver l'avenir. Parce que nous avons adopté une approche à long terme. Nous avons
            
résisté à ceux qui voulaient combattre une crise de la dette souveraine par une
            
augmentation de la dette, par des déficits publics.
            
Europe is stronger now than five years ago. The eurozone is more integrated. But we have
            
to do a lot more to bring down structural employment and poverty. Both were already too
            
high before the financial crisis – in some countries already in the nineties.
            
We managed to save the eurozone and the Union itself from collapse, but we cannot miss
            
that other rendez-vous with history: a Europe that is more socially coherent, with fewer
            
inequalities, with more lasting jobs. A Europe sufficiently resilient economically to finance
            
the social models that the world envies us. A fair Europe. A continent less fractured and
            
happier than it is today. A Europe not dominated by fear, by hate-mongering, by
            
intolerance –– but by hope, by solidarity, and understanding. We need a joint effort by the
            
European institutions and by the Member States to further build this Europe, our Europe.
            
We live in a dangerous world, where a united, determined Union is greatly needed.
            
The people of Ukraine made a decisive choice in favour of our European values. It was and
            
is a choice for a civilisation. They are on the right side of history, and all of us here today
            
pay tribute to those who have died or were wounded for that cause, our common cause.
            
And it reminds me of what Abraham Lincoln said in his famous speech in Gettysburg that
            
we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation, under
            
God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people,
            
for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
            
The people of Ukraine refused to live any longer in a culture of lies, bribes, manipulation,
            
blackmail and poverty. We must support them on the road that they have chosen, also in
            
these dangerous days. We cannot forget our friends in Georgia and Moldova who also
            
crossed the river. The countries of the Union want to live in peace with all countries on our
            
continent. We stand ready to cooperate more closely with those who share this choice.
            
The old world of before 1990, before the fall of the Berlin wall has vanished, forever, it
            
should never come back as we made clear in our European Council of yesterday. We are
            
on the side of those who want to share a society based on democracy, on justice.
            
That is why we gave our support to African countries. Not because it was in our economic
            
interest, but because we share a common enemy: extremism, polarisation , intolerance,
            
terrorism. The Union is the biggest donor of development aid in the world. Let's be proud
            
of that, our Europe is a generous Europe.

Of course from time to time we failed. Of course we were not always coherent or not
            
always sufficiently united, but a new Europe is being shown to the world.
            
I know this may sound strange in a growing euro-negative climate, but we have good
            
reasons to hope. Not because we are resorting to the pep-talk so common to election
            
campaigns. No – because we have arguments for hope.
            
And let us speak up for Europe, let us use words of confidence and words of determination.
            
We are not a lost continent and let there not be a lost generation. History is made by men
            
and women. And the men and women of Europe can and will build a better future.
            
That is also my message to the future leadership of the EU institutions. We, the current
            
leadership, did our duty. I will leave with a peaceful conscience. It is up to our successors
            
to write a new chapter in the history of our Union. And the EPP and its candidates have
            
once again to play a decisive role.

Rarely did these famous words, by the              anthropologist Margaret Mead, ever rung more true than in the case of the Red Cross.              Henri Dunant, citoyen de Genève, était un homme d'affaire de tout juste 31 ans lorsqu'il              découvrit l'horreur des champs de bataille ensanglantés de Solférino. Son cri du cœur, son              appel, résonna au-delà des frontières – il résonna en Belgique. Et il résonne encore              aujourd'hui, de part le monde et dans notre pays, après un siècle et demi.              Met deze verjaardag vandaag, vieren we méér dan de 150 jaar sinds de stichting van het              Rode Kruis, meer dan anderhalve eeuw van inzet om de medemens. We vieren de geboorte              van de moderne humanitaire beginselen, 150 jaar van humanitair werk - in neutraliteit,              onafhankelijkheid en onpartijdigheid.              Today we remember an idea. A simple statement: that even in wars, there are limits to              what is tolerable. That we should never give up on humanity. We celebrate a quantum leap              – so generous yet so sensible, so seemingly out of reach yet so necessary. We celebrate a              work of peace, guided by ideals, but driven by pragmatism. The Red Cross always pleaded              for the world as it should be, yet acted in the world as it is.              Fighting atrocity and indifference one wounded at a time. Each human being is unique.              Every man or woman, boy or girl counts.

And Belgium can be proud that it was there from the very start. Dunant's call was heard by              our countrymen and women. We owe them our Belgian Red Cross, the oldest national              society of the movement worldwide. Those brave first supporters, those patient advocates,              who saw humanity as their duty, driven by compassion and love – what would they think              today I wonder?              Seeing all the path travelled, all the work done, all the dedication, they would surely feel              immense pride. Probably none of them would have dreamt at the time that the adventure              would live strong for 150 years. Because the Red Cross was not designed to last. And for              this very reason, their amazement at today's achievements might also include a certain              bitterness – that the Red Cross should still be necessary even in the twenty-first century.              We avoided world wars in the last decades, but war, killings, torture, genocide were not              banned. Evil did not disappear.              Reeds na 50 jaar – in 1914 –, was ons nationale Rode Kruis al sterk verankerd. Ze genoot              al de patronage en een persoonlijk engagement van het Koninklijk Huis – een steun, die tot              vandaag aanhoudt.              La Croix Rouge avait cinquante ans, on était en quatorze. Déjà, son action était              internationale, et ses volontaires avaient déjà régulièrement répondu présents sur les              terrains de crises – de l'Alsace à la Constantinople.              Mais en ce début 1914, nul ne se doutait du drame qui s'apprêtait à engouffrer notre              continent – et dont notre pays serait le plus sanglant champs de bataille. Des millions              d'hommes, venus de partout dans le monde, souffraient ou mourraient sur nos si paisibles              terres.              Our Belgian Red Cross was mobilised like never before. Hospitals everywhere – even in              the Royal Palace! Today we should also pay homage to those who brought essential care              and comfort to the wounded on our soil.              The pro-European movements of the first half of the twentieth century had a lot in              common with the early supporters of the Red Cross. They too fought for an idea so big that              it seemed utopian; so simple and yet so necessary. The plea for Europe, like the plea for              humanitarian principles decades before, was a plea for peace. An appeal to the sense of              personal duty in the face of human suffering. It was a movement of the people, by the              people and for the people.              In a way, the European idea was meant to make the Red Cross redundant in our countries,              by closing down forever their battlefields. The founders of Europe succeeded for the same              reason that Henri Dunant succeeded. They too were guided by values, yet driven by              pragmatism.               EUCO 36/14               2               E               L'Union européenne et la Croix Rouge étaient faites pour s'entendre…              En tot op de dag vandaag, in crisisgebieden over de hele wereld, werken het Rode Kruis en              de Europese Unie nauw samen.              We share principles, values and goals. Together, we promote and uphold fundamental              humanitarian law.              One of the reasons why the Red Cross can play a unique role worldwide, and why it is              such a precious interlocutor for the European Union, is because of its unique network. The              power of the Red Cross is local. Its reach is unrivalled. Nearly in every country, ""sister              societies"" are hard at work, everywhere they might be needed, and powered by the people.              The Red Cross volunteers know the world as it is, they know its generosity and they know              its grimness. There are no places where the Red Cross doesn't go if it is needed – always              impartial, always neutral, always independent.              Over the years, its work has evolved, just like the European Union's international              humanitarian work. Still protection, but also prevention. It is true abroad and it is true at              home. All the Red Cross ""societies"" are connected. They support each other. Each              contributes its own expertise, wherever it is needed.              The Belgian Red Cross is no exception. It has its own missions abroad, and it supports the              work of other Red Cross programmes through fundraising and expertise. But the Red Cross              entered also into our daily lives, via numerous activities at the service of people.              Today in Belgium, the face of the Red Cross is its twenty-five thousand volunteers and              close to two thousand full-time staff. Their presence is always reassuring, whether for 'first              aid', blood donations, or reaching out to the most vulnerable and isolated. Against              marginalisation, against isolation, against poverty, Red Cross volunteers never give up.              They are people of all ages, of all streets of life, and at the service of all. Always              professional, always understanding. They are there in the hard times… and there in the              bright times – think of events like football matches, festivals or concerts, or the 21st July!              Many give their time. They are not asking for money. For them, the Red Cross is a part of              their search for meaning in life. All deserve our gratitude, our respect.              So let me wish every one of them a very happy year of celebration for this 150th              anniversary, and thank the Red Cross of Belgium, on behalf of the European Union, for its              amazing work!

Herman Van Rompuy
            
President of the European Council
            
Celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Belgium Red Cross
            
""The European Union: of, for and by the people""
            
"" ever doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world;
            
indeed, it's the only thing that ever has."" Rarely did these famous words, by the
            
anthropologist Margaret Mead, ever rung more true than in the case of the Red Cross.
            
Henri Dunant, citoyen de Genève, était un homme d'affaire de tout juste 31 ans lorsqu'il
            
découvrit l'horreur des champs de bataille ensanglantés de Solférino. Son cri du cœur, son
            
appel, résonna au-delà des frontières – il résonna en Belgique. Et il résonne encore
            
aujourd'hui, de part le monde et dans notre pays, après un siècle et demi.
            
Met deze verjaardag vandaag, vieren we méér dan de 150 jaar sinds de stichting van het
            
Rode Kruis, meer dan anderhalve eeuw van inzet om de medemens. We vieren de geboorte
            
van de moderne humanitaire beginselen, 150 jaar van humanitair werk - in neutraliteit,
            
onafhankelijkheid en onpartijdigheid.
            
Today we remember an idea. A simple statement: that even in wars, there are limits to
            
what is tolerable. That we should never give up on humanity. We celebrate a quantum leap
            
– so generous yet so sensible, so seemingly out of reach yet so necessary. We celebrate a
            
work of peace, guided by ideals, but driven by pragmatism. The Red Cross always pleaded
            
for the world as it should be, yet acted in the world as it is.
            
Fighting atrocity and indifference one wounded at a time. Each human being is unique.
            
Every man or woman, boy or girl counts.

The founding principle of the Red Cross – that civilians, sick and wounded combatants,
            
and prisoners of war should be protected in times of war – has become the cornerstone of
            
international humanitarian law.
            
And Belgium can be proud that it was there from the very start. Dunant's call was heard by
            
our countrymen and women. We owe them our Belgian Red Cross, the oldest national
            
society of the movement worldwide. Those brave first supporters, those patient advocates,
            
who saw humanity as their duty, driven by compassion and love – what would they think
            
today I wonder?
            
Seeing all the path travelled, all the work done, all the dedication, they would surely feel
            
immense pride. Probably none of them would have dreamt at the time that the adventure
            
would live strong for 150 years. Because the Red Cross was not designed to last. And for
            
this very reason, their amazement at today's achievements might also include a certain
            
bitterness – that the Red Cross should still be necessary even in the twenty-first century.
            
We avoided world wars in the last decades, but war, killings, torture, genocide were not
            
banned. Evil did not disappear.
            
Reeds na 50 jaar – in 1914 –, was ons nationale Rode Kruis al sterk verankerd. Ze genoot
            
al de patronage en een persoonlijk engagement van het Koninklijk Huis – een steun, die tot
            
vandaag aanhoudt.
            
La Croix Rouge avait cinquante ans, on était en quatorze. Déjà, son action était
            
internationale, et ses volontaires avaient déjà régulièrement répondu présents sur les
            
terrains de crises – de l'Alsace à la Constantinople.
            
Mais en ce début 1914, nul ne se doutait du drame qui s'apprêtait à engouffrer notre
            
continent – et dont notre pays serait le plus sanglant champs de bataille. Des millions
            
d'hommes, venus de partout dans le monde, souffraient ou mourraient sur nos si paisibles
            
terres.
            
Our Belgian Red Cross was mobilised like never before. Hospitals everywhere – even in
            
the Royal Palace! Today we should also pay homage to those who brought essential care
            
and comfort to the wounded on our soil.
            
The pro-European movements of the first half of the twentieth century had a lot in
            
common with the early supporters of the Red Cross. They too fought for an idea so big that
            
it seemed utopian; so simple and yet so necessary. The plea for Europe, like the plea for
            
humanitarian principles decades before, was a plea for peace. An appeal to the sense of
            
personal duty in the face of human suffering. It was a movement of the people, by the
            
people and for the people.
            
In a way, the European idea was meant to make the Red Cross redundant in our countries,
            
by closing down forever their battlefields. The founders of Europe succeeded for the same
            
reason that Henri Dunant succeeded. They too were guided by values, yet driven by
            
pragmatism.

L'Union européenne et la Croix Rouge étaient faites pour s'entendre…
            
En tot op de dag vandaag, in crisisgebieden over de hele wereld, werken het Rode Kruis en
            
de Europese Unie nauw samen.
            
We share principles, values and goals. Together, we promote and uphold fundamental
            
humanitarian law.
            
One of the reasons why the Red Cross can play a unique role worldwide, and why it is
            
such a precious interlocutor for the European Union, is because of its unique network. The
            
power of the Red Cross is local. Its reach is unrivalled. Nearly in every country, ""sister
            
societies"" are hard at work, everywhere they might be needed, and powered by the people.
            
The Red Cross volunteers know the world as it is, they know its generosity and they know
            
its grimness. There are no places where the Red Cross doesn't go if it is needed – always
            
impartial, always neutral, always independent.
            
Over the years, its work has evolved, just like the European Union's international
            
humanitarian work. Still protection, but also prevention. It is true abroad and it is true at
            
home. All the Red Cross ""societies"" are connected. They support each other. Each
            
contributes its own expertise, wherever it is needed.
            
The Belgian Red Cross is no exception. It has its own missions abroad, and it supports the
            
work of other Red Cross programmes through fundraising and expertise. But the Red Cross
            
entered also into our daily lives, via numerous activities at the service of people.
            
Today in Belgium, the face of the Red Cross is its twenty-five thousand volunteers and
            
close to two thousand full-time staff. Their presence is always reassuring, whether for 'first
            
aid', blood donations, or reaching out to the most vulnerable and isolated. Against
            
marginalisation, against isolation, against poverty, Red Cross volunteers never give up.
            
They are people of all ages, of all streets of life, and at the service of all. Always
            
professional, always understanding. They are there in the hard times… and there in the
            
bright times – think of events like football matches, festivals or concerts, or the 21st July!
            
Many give their time. They are not asking for money. For them, the Red Cross is a part of
            
their search for meaning in life. All deserve our gratitude, our respect.
            
So let me wish every one of them a very happy year of celebration for this 150th
            
anniversary, and thank the Red Cross of Belgium, on behalf of the European Union, for its
            
amazing work!

COU?CIL              THE PRESIDE?T               Luxembourg, 12 September 2013              EUCO 183/13              PRESSE 368              PR PCE 161               Keynote speech by President of the European Council              Herman Van Rompuy              at the closing event of the celebration of the 35th anniversary              of the European Court of Auditors              (FR)              Je suis heureux d'être parmi vous cet après-midi, à l'occasion de cette conférence qui              marque le trente-cinquième anniversaire de la Cour des comptes européenne. C'est pour              moi toujours un plaisir de revenir au Luxembourg. En tant que citoyens du Bénélux, on se              comprend!              Mais c'est avec une émotion particulière que je viens ici en tant que Président du Conseil              européen, dans cette ville qui a vu naître, et grandir, les premières institutions de notre              Union. ""L'ébauche d'un nouveau monde sur le vieux continent"", comme le disait Jean              Monnet... C'est ici, dans cette première citadelle de l'Europe, que s'est forgé l'esprit de nos              institutions – au point que Monnet d'ailleurs appelait cette approche pionnière ""l'esprit de              Luxembourg"", bien avant que les institutions européennes ne s'étendent vers Bruxelles. Cet              esprit de Luxembourg persiste, ici aussi, à la Cour.              35 ans, ce n'est pas rien. En ce mois de septembre, ce sont aussi quatre décennies que l'on              commémore depuis le rapport Aigner – devrais-je dire le manifeste? – appelant à sa              création: ""Pour Une Cour des Comptes Européenne"". Non sans raison, le souci de doter              l'Union d'une capacité réflexive – celle de contrôler, d'authentifier, d'évaluer – était présent              dès les origines; déjà, la CECA de 1952 disposait de la Commission de contrôle, dont votre              Cour a pris le relai, et approfondi le travail.               PRESS              Dirk De Backer - Spokesperson of the President - ( +32 (0)2 281 9768 - +32 (0)497 59 99 19              Preben Aamann - Deputy Spokesperson of the President - ( +32 (0)2 281 2060 - +32 (0)476 85 05 43               press.president@consilium.europa.eu http://www.european-council.europa.eu/the-president               EUCO 183/13               1               E?               Je dis ""non sans raison"" car cette responsabilité, celle de rendre des comptes, est à mes              yeux une condition essentielle de la crédibilité, c'est le socle de la confiance. Car sans              évaluation, le sens de l'action publique nous échappe. Sans comptes crédibles, sans              comptes vérifiés, pas de discussion valable, ni de progrès possible dans l’action.              Cet éclairage est essentiel pour la légitimité de l'action publique, je dirais au moins depuis              le lien établi entre taxation et représentation au XVIIIème siècle. Et cet éclairage est tout              aussi essentiel pour la qualité du débat public. Le travail méticuleux de vérification et              d'évaluation de l'action publique est garant de la solidité des fondations de l'édifice              démocratique. Déjà en 1789, la ""Déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme et du              citoyen"" proclamait dans son article XV: ""La Société a le droit de demander compte à tout              Agent public de son administration.""              Il en est bien sûr de même pour l'Europe. Avec la naissance de la Cour des comptes              européenne, il s'agissait d'ailleurs bien, pour reprendre cette belle expression de l'époque de              Hans Kutcher, alors président de la Cour de justice, d'incarner institutionnellement la              ""conscience financière"" de la jeune Europe d'alors.              Ce rôle de conscience financière que vous jouez, vos interlocuteurs dans les Etats              membres, l'occupent de même auprès de leurs gouvernements et parlements. Et je salue              d'ailleurs le dialogue constant que vous entretenez entre homologues à travers l'ensemble              de nos pays.              S'il est une leçon que, comme Union, nous nous devons de tirer des grandes difficultés              économiques et financières de ces dernières années, c'est bien celle-ci: la nécessité de              renouer avec notre conscience financière collective, au sens le plus large. Renouer              consciemment: en tant que décideurs, en tant que citoyens. Revenir sur les excès et erreurs              du passé, rétablir des bases saines, pour mieux anticiper l'avenir. C'est une responsabilité              politique, citoyenne.              Mais cette prise de conscience, à tous les niveaux, ne peut se traduire en actions efficaces              qu'en s'appuyant sur des comptes sincères et des évaluations impartiales, en s’appuyant sur              les travaux d’institutions telle que la vôtre. Cour des comptes européenne au niveau              européen, autorités suprêmes de contrôle au niveau des Etats membres.              Cette leçon dont je parle, c'est aussi elle qui guide, depuis quatre ans déjà, les actions              lancées en réponse à la crise. Et au fil de ces actions, c'est une Union plus responsable et              plus solidaire qui se dessine. Mieux armée d'instruments de surveillance économique et              budgétaire – un vrai arsenal! –, pour mieux prévenir et corriger si nécessaire. Protégée par              des mécanismes de stabilité efficaces, et une solidarité qui a fait ses preuves. Lucide sur les              défis de l'avenir et les efforts nécessaires pour les surmonter.              C'est aussi une Europe plus consciente des liens forts qui l'animent: cette interdépendance              dont la pleine – et parfois douloureuse – réalisation ne s'est faite qu'avec les épreuves que              nous avons eu à surmonter ensemble, ces dernières années.               EUCO 183/13               2               E?               Pour les chefs d'Etat et de gouvernement qui siègent au Conseil européen, cela ne fait              aucun doute. Cette interdépendance est la réalité de l'Europe d'aujourd'hui – et elle est              encore plus au sein de l'eurozone. Cette interdépendance accrue, tant économique que              politique, dont la crise a révélé l’ampleur est aussi la rançon du succès du processus              d’intégration européenne. Il nous faut agir en conséquence, et travailler à parfaire l’Union              économique et monétaire.              C'est pourquoi ensemble nous nous sommes engagés, sur la base des rapports que j'ai              préparés sur l'avenir de l'Union économique et monétaire, à doter la zone euro de cadres              appropriés de gouvernance financière, économique et budgétaire.              Nous sommes à l'œuvre sur chacun de ces chapitres, et bien avancés sur certains. Pour              assurer la gouvernance financière, nous bâtissons l'union bancaire, qui s'appliquera pour              l'ensemble des banques de la zone euro, avec des mécanismes de supervision et de              résolution bancaire uniques.              Sur la gouvernance économique et budgétaire, plusieurs outils sont déjà en place pour              permettre une meilleure coordination des politiques nationales. Au Conseil européen, il est              clair pour chacun que les décisions prises dans un Etat membre peuvent influencer la              situation dans d'autres pays, voire dans toute l'Union.              C'est pourquoi notamment, dans le cadre du Semestre européen, nous adoptons ensemble              des lignes directrices communes pour les politiques économiques et budgétaires nationales,              ainsi que des recommandations spécifiques par pays.              Et nous poursuivons nos travaux en explorant de nouvelles pistes pour renforcer l’Union              Economique et Monétaire dans son ensemble, et plus particulièrement dans sa dimension              économique. Par exemple des engagements plus formels de la part des Etats, en quelque              sorte des contrats, portant sur la poursuite de réformes structurelles essentielles pour la              croissance et l'emploi.              A plus court terme, ce renforcement économique passe aussi par les ressources communes              que nous avons réunies pour faire face à l'urgence. L'urgence financière, en particulier par              les fonds d'urgences et de stabilisation pour l'eurozone. Et l'urgence économique et sociale,              grâce à des financements européens ciblés contre le chômage (notamment des jeunes) et              pour les petites et moyennes entreprises dans les régions sinistrées.              Qui dit gouvernance, pose en filigrane la question du cadre des responsabilités: qui rend              compte de ces nouvelles actions, de ces nouvelles structures, et auprès de qui? Si cette              question appelle des réponses au cas par cas, souvent il me semble que seule une double              légitimité, à la fois nationale et européenne, pourra satisfaire aux exigences de situations              complexes.              Pour cela un réel dialogue entre les différents niveaux assurant la pleine légitimité de              l’action me paraît indispensable, par exemple entre le parlement européen et les parlements              nationaux. Les Cours des comptes européenne et nationales auront aussi à trouver leur              juste place dans ces nouveaux cadres de la zone euro, dont l'évolution est encore en cours.              C'est un aspect important de la légitimité.               EUCO 183/13               3               E?               Pour ne prendre que deux exemples qui concernent la Cour des comptes européenne:              - Tout d'abord pour l'Union bancaire: la Banque centrale européenne se voit confier de              nouvelles responsabilités en matière de supervision bancaire. La Cour des comptes              européenne, cela a été précisé explicitement dans le règlement par le Conseil à la demande              de la Cour, évaluera également les nouvelles activités de supervision de la Banque.              - Toujours sur la zone euro, prenons cette fois notre fonds d'urgence commun, le              Mécanisme européen de stabilité. Ici il s'agit de fonds intergouvernementaux, donc en              marge des structures institutionnelles classiques, et donc avec un mécanisme de contrôle              qui lui est propre. Toutefois, la Cour des comptes européenne nomme un des membres de              ce Conseil de contrôle (il en est d'ailleurs le Président), et deux autres sont nommés par les              autorités supérieures de contrôle nationales.              Plus généralement, une coordination renforcée des politiques économiques et des              politiques budgétaires appelle à une meilleure harmonisation des systèmes de comptabilité              publique nationaux. Comme j'ai eu l'occasion de le souligner en mai dernier lors d'une              Conférence qui s'est tenue à Bruxelles sur le sujet, c'est une condition nécessaire pour              permettre une réelle discussion au niveau européen. Pour pouvoir comparer les budgets,              comparer les dépenses, et obtenir ainsi une véritable vue d'ensemble, encore faut-il parler              des mêmes chiffres. Cette harmonisation est aussi importante pour la coopération entre les              autorités suprêmes de contrôle et en définitive pour l'évaluation des politiques publiques              dans notre Union.              (EN)              Allow me to continue my remarks in English. The harder the times, the higher people's              expectations, when it comes to how their taxes are spent. And rightly so. Especially when              they themselves are striving to do more with less money at home, they naturally expect the              same from public spending. Every euro has to go where it can make the most impact.              It's the case in every one of our countries, and it's the case for Europe too. Which is why              the Union's budget for the rest of the decade, which leaders designed earlier this year, had              to be a modernised, realistic budget, focused on the most pressing concerns, and on making              Europe fit for the future.              For the Court of Auditors' perspective, the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework              will bring new challenges. Funding in important areas like youth employment or research              & development will be frontloaded, to get a wave of projects going that should help kickstart growth and employment throughout the European Union. But for the Court, I              understand that this will also translate into a spike of audits in areas where results are not              easily measurable.              Another challenge may stem from the June European Council decision to expand joint              Commission and European Investment Bank risk-sharing financial instruments in order to              leverage more private sector and capital market investments for SMEs. That means the              Court of Auditors will need to take account of the wider range of use of European budget.               EUCO 183/13               4               E?               As we look to the actual execution of the 2014-2020 budget, to where and how the funds              will be spent, the focus has to be above all on results. We need to show how this money is              making a difference for citizens across Europe.              That's why the growing emphasis in the Court's work on performance auditing is to be              encouraged and developed. Because it helps politicians and policy makers answer the two              key questions they continually ask themselves: first, is the money allowing us to achieve              our agreed objectives and second, could we do it more efficiently? At the end of the day,              I'm convinced it's above all through results that we will convince citizens. By making a              difference for employment, for living standards.              As European institutions, we share the responsibility to make these results known, and to              work hard to overcome shortcomings. In doing so, we share another responsibility: that of              being as didactic as we possibly can.              You know this well at the Court: your reports are not released into a void but into the              rough and tumble of political life and media reporting. Every year, they generate headlines              that ""yet again the EU's accounts have not been signed off"", with deceptive allegations of              fraud and mismanagement. You and I know that such headlines can be misleading.              Normally the Court finds that the accounts are overall correct but that some decisions have              been taken without fully following correct procedures or other faults have occurred.              Crucially, amounts paid out in error are usually retrieved subsequently.              But given this media handling of information, and its impact on public opinion in some              countries, the Court might want to give some further thought as to how it can encourage              more nuanced media reporting. It's important that citizens can have the whole picture, with              all its nuances.              (FR)              Au final, nous sommes tous responsables de l'Europe et de son image. Nous avons tous à              rendre compte de l'Union. En période de crise, il est plus vital que jamais de nourrir la              confiance par un contrôle impartial et une évaluation méticuleuse de l’action publique. Car              c'est ainsi seulement que nous parviendrons à établir les résultats de nos actions et à les              orienter pour les rendre les plus efficaces possibles. Il nous faut aussi être didactique pour              convaincre les Européens, et démontrer clairement que l'Europe n'est pas la source des              problèmes, mais bien la solution.              La Cour joue pleinement son rôle de ""socle de la confiance"" pour nos institutions, j'en suis              convaincu. Nous continuons à compter sur vous!

Herman Van Rompuy
            
at the closing event of the celebration of the 35th anniversary
            
of the European Court of Auditors
            
(FR)
            
Je suis heureux d'être parmi vous cet après-midi, à l'occasion de cette conférence qui
            
marque le trente-cinquième anniversaire de la Cour des comptes européenne. C'est pour
            
moi toujours un plaisir de revenir au Luxembourg. En tant que citoyens du Bénélux, on se
            
comprend!
            
Mais c'est avec une émotion particulière que je viens ici en tant que Président du Conseil
            
européen, dans cette ville qui a vu naître, et grandir, les premières institutions de notre
            
Union. ""L'ébauche d'un nouveau monde sur le vieux continent"", comme le disait Jean
            
Monnet... C'est ici, dans cette première citadelle de l'Europe, que s'est forgé l'esprit de nos
            
institutions – au point que Monnet d'ailleurs appelait cette approche pionnière ""l'esprit de
            
Luxembourg"", bien avant que les institutions européennes ne s'étendent vers Bruxelles. Cet
            
esprit de Luxembourg persiste, ici aussi, à la Cour.
            
35 ans, ce n'est pas rien. En ce mois de septembre, ce sont aussi quatre décennies que l'on
            
commémore depuis le rapport Aigner – devrais-je dire le manifeste? – appelant à sa
            
création: ""Pour Une Cour des Comptes Européenne"". Non sans raison, le souci de doter
            
l'Union d'une capacité réflexive – celle de contrôler, d'authentifier, d'évaluer – était présent
            
dès les origines; déjà, la CECA de 1952 disposait de la Commission de contrôle, dont votre
            
Cour a pris le relai, et approfondi le travail.

E?
            

Je dis ""non sans raison"" car cette responsabilité, celle de rendre des comptes, est à mes
            
yeux une condition essentielle de la crédibilité, c'est le socle de la confiance. Car sans
            
évaluation, le sens de l'action publique nous échappe. Sans comptes crédibles, sans
            
comptes vérifiés, pas de discussion valable, ni de progrès possible dans l’action.
            
Cet éclairage est essentiel pour la légitimité de l'action publique, je dirais au moins depuis
            
le lien établi entre taxation et représentation au XVIIIème siècle. Et cet éclairage est tout
            
aussi essentiel pour la qualité du débat public. Le travail méticuleux de vérification et
            
d'évaluation de l'action publique est garant de la solidité des fondations de l'édifice
            
démocratique. Déjà en 1789, la ""Déclaration universelle des droits de l'homme et du
            
citoyen"" proclamait dans son article XV: ""La Société a le droit de demander compte à tout
            
Agent public de son administration.""
            
Il en est bien sûr de même pour l'Europe. Avec la naissance de la Cour des comptes
            
européenne, il s'agissait d'ailleurs bien, pour reprendre cette belle expression de l'époque de
            
Hans Kutcher, alors président de la Cour de justice, d'incarner institutionnellement la
            
""conscience financière"" de la jeune Europe d'alors.
            
Ce rôle de conscience financière que vous jouez, vos interlocuteurs dans les Etats
            
membres, l'occupent de même auprès de leurs gouvernements et parlements. Et je salue
            
d'ailleurs le dialogue constant que vous entretenez entre homologues à travers l'ensemble
            
de nos pays.
            
S'il est une leçon que, comme Union, nous nous devons de tirer des grandes difficultés
            
économiques et financières de ces dernières années, c'est bien celle-ci: la nécessité de
            
renouer avec notre conscience financière collective, au sens le plus large. Renouer
            
consciemment: en tant que décideurs, en tant que citoyens. Revenir sur les excès et erreurs
            
du passé, rétablir des bases saines, pour mieux anticiper l'avenir. C'est une responsabilité
            
politique, citoyenne.
            
Mais cette prise de conscience, à tous les niveaux, ne peut se traduire en actions efficaces
            
qu'en s'appuyant sur des comptes sincères et des évaluations impartiales, en s’appuyant sur
            
les travaux d’institutions telle que la vôtre. Cour des comptes européenne au niveau
            
européen, autorités suprêmes de contrôle au niveau des Etats membres.
            
Cette leçon dont je parle, c'est aussi elle qui guide, depuis quatre ans déjà, les actions
            
lancées en réponse à la crise. Et au fil de ces actions, c'est une Union plus responsable et
            
plus solidaire qui se dessine. Mieux armée d'instruments de surveillance économique et
            
budgétaire – un vrai arsenal! –, pour mieux prévenir et corriger si nécessaire. Protégée par
            
des mécanismes de stabilité efficaces, et une solidarité qui a fait ses preuves. Lucide sur les
            
défis de l'avenir et les efforts nécessaires pour les surmonter.
            
C'est aussi une Europe plus consciente des liens forts qui l'animent: cette interdépendance
            
dont la pleine – et parfois douloureuse – réalisation ne s'est faite qu'avec les épreuves que
            
nous avons eu à surmonter ensemble, ces dernières années.
            

EUCO 183/13

E?
            

Pour les chefs d'Etat et de gouvernement qui siègent au Conseil européen, cela ne fait
            
aucun doute. Cette interdépendance est la réalité de l'Europe d'aujourd'hui – et elle est
            
encore plus au sein de l'eurozone. Cette interdépendance accrue, tant économique que
            
politique, dont la crise a révélé l’ampleur est aussi la rançon du succès du processus
            
d’intégration européenne. Il nous faut agir en conséquence, et travailler à parfaire l’Union
            
économique et monétaire.
            
C'est pourquoi ensemble nous nous sommes engagés, sur la base des rapports que j'ai
            
préparés sur l'avenir de l'Union économique et monétaire, à doter la zone euro de cadres
            
appropriés de gouvernance financière, économique et budgétaire.
            
Nous sommes à l'œuvre sur chacun de ces chapitres, et bien avancés sur certains. Pour
            
assurer la gouvernance financière, nous bâtissons l'union bancaire, qui s'appliquera pour
            
l'ensemble des banques de la zone euro, avec des mécanismes de supervision et de
            
résolution bancaire uniques.
            
Sur la gouvernance économique et budgétaire, plusieurs outils sont déjà en place pour
            
permettre une meilleure coordination des politiques nationales. Au Conseil européen, il est
            
clair pour chacun que les décisions prises dans un Etat membre peuvent influencer la
            
situation dans d'autres pays, voire dans toute l'Union.
            
C'est pourquoi notamment, dans le cadre du Semestre européen, nous adoptons ensemble
            
des lignes directrices communes pour les politiques économiques et budgétaires nationales,
            
ainsi que des recommandations spécifiques par pays.
            
Et nous poursuivons nos travaux en explorant de nouvelles pistes pour renforcer l’Union
            
Economique et Monétaire dans son ensemble, et plus particulièrement dans sa dimension
            
économique. Par exemple des engagements plus formels de la part des Etats, en quelque
            
sorte des contrats, portant sur la poursuite de réformes structurelles essentielles pour la
            
croissance et l'emploi.
            
A plus court terme, ce renforcement économique passe aussi par les ressources communes
            
que nous avons réunies pour faire face à l'urgence. L'urgence financière, en particulier par
            
les fonds d'urgences et de stabilisation pour l'eurozone. Et l'urgence économique et sociale,
            
grâce à des financements européens ciblés contre le chômage (notamment des jeunes) et
            
pour les petites et moyennes entreprises dans les régions sinistrées.
            
Qui dit gouvernance, pose en filigrane la question du cadre des responsabilités: qui rend
            
compte de ces nouvelles actions, de ces nouvelles structures, et auprès de qui? Si cette
            
question appelle des réponses au cas par cas, souvent il me semble que seule une double
            
légitimité, à la fois nationale et européenne, pourra satisfaire aux exigences de situations
            
complexes.
            
Pour cela un réel dialogue entre les différents niveaux assurant la pleine légitimité de
            
l’action me paraît indispensable, par exemple entre le parlement européen et les parlements
            
nationaux. Les Cours des comptes européenne et nationales auront aussi à trouver leur
            
juste place dans ces nouveaux cadres de la zone euro, dont l'évolution est encore en cours.
            
C'est un aspect important de la légitimité.

E?
            

Pour ne prendre que deux exemples qui concernent la Cour des comptes européenne:
            
- Tout d'abord pour l'Union bancaire: la Banque centrale européenne se voit confier de
            
nouvelles responsabilités en matière de supervision bancaire. La Cour des comptes
            
européenne, cela a été précisé explicitement dans le règlement par le Conseil à la demande
            
de la Cour, évaluera également les nouvelles activités de supervision de la Banque.
            
- Toujours sur la zone euro, prenons cette fois notre fonds d'urgence commun, le
            
Mécanisme européen de stabilité. Ici il s'agit de fonds intergouvernementaux, donc en
            
marge des structures institutionnelles classiques, et donc avec un mécanisme de contrôle
            
qui lui est propre. Toutefois, la Cour des comptes européenne nomme un des membres de
            
ce Conseil de contrôle (il en est d'ailleurs le Président), et deux autres sont nommés par les
            
autorités supérieures de contrôle nationales.
            
Plus généralement, une coordination renforcée des politiques économiques et des
            
politiques budgétaires appelle à une meilleure harmonisation des systèmes de comptabilité
            
publique nationaux. Comme j'ai eu l'occasion de le souligner en mai dernier lors d'une
            
Conférence qui s'est tenue à Bruxelles sur le sujet, c'est une condition nécessaire pour
            
permettre une réelle discussion au niveau européen. Pour pouvoir comparer les budgets,
            
comparer les dépenses, et obtenir ainsi une véritable vue d'ensemble, encore faut-il parler
            
des mêmes chiffres. Cette harmonisation est aussi importante pour la coopération entre les
            
autorités suprêmes de contrôle et en définitive pour l'évaluation des politiques publiques
            
dans notre Union.

Allow me to continue my remarks in English. The harder the times, the higher people's
            
expectations, when it comes to how their taxes are spent. And rightly so. Especially when
            
they themselves are striving to do more with less money at home, they naturally expect the
            
same from public spending. Every euro has to go where it can make the most impact.
            
It's the case in every one of our countries, and it's the case for Europe too. Which is why
            
the Union's budget for the rest of the decade, which leaders designed earlier this year, had
            
to be a modernised, realistic budget, focused on the most pressing concerns, and on making
            
Europe fit for the future.
            
For the Court of Auditors' perspective, the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework
            
will bring new challenges. Funding in important areas like youth employment or research
            
& development will be frontloaded, to get a wave of projects going that should help kickstart growth and employment throughout the European Union. But for the Court, I
            
understand that this will also translate into a spike of audits in areas where results are not
            
easily measurable.
            
Another challenge may stem from the June European Council decision to expand joint
            
Commission and European Investment Bank risk-sharing financial instruments in order to
            
leverage more private sector and capital market investments for SMEs. That means the
            
Court of Auditors will need to take account of the wider range of use of European budget.

As we look to the actual execution of the 2014-2020 budget, to where and how the funds
            
will be spent, the focus has to be above all on results. We need to show how this money is
            
making a difference for citizens across Europe.
            
That's why the growing emphasis in the Court's work on performance auditing is to be
            
encouraged and developed. Because it helps politicians and policy makers answer the two
            
key questions they continually ask themselves: first, is the money allowing us to achieve
            
our agreed objectives and second, could we do it more efficiently? At the end of the day,
            
I'm convinced it's above all through results that we will convince citizens. By making a
            
difference for employment, for living standards.
            
As European institutions, we share the responsibility to make these results known, and to
            
work hard to overcome shortcomings. In doing so, we share another responsibility: that of
            
being as didactic as we possibly can.
            
You know this well at the Court: your reports are not released into a void but into the
            
rough and tumble of political life and media reporting. Every year, they generate headlines
            
that ""yet again the EU's accounts have not been signed off"", with deceptive allegations of
            
fraud and mismanagement. You and I know that such headlines can be misleading.
            
Normally the Court finds that the accounts are overall correct but that some decisions have
            
been taken without fully following correct procedures or other faults have occurred.
            
Crucially, amounts paid out in error are usually retrieved subsequently.
            
But given this media handling of information, and its impact on public opinion in some
            
countries, the Court might want to give some further thought as to how it can encourage
            
more nuanced media reporting. It's important that citizens can have the whole picture, with
            
all its nuances.

Au final, nous sommes tous responsables de l'Europe et de son image. Nous avons tous à
            
rendre compte de l'Union. En période de crise, il est plus vital que jamais de nourrir la
            
confiance par un contrôle impartial et une évaluation méticuleuse de l’action publique. Car
            
c'est ainsi seulement que nous parviendrons à établir les résultats de nos actions et à les
            
orienter pour les rendre les plus efficaces possibles. Il nous faut aussi être didactique pour
            
convaincre les Européens, et démontrer clairement que l'Europe n'est pas la source des
            
problèmes, mais bien la solution.
            
La Cour joue pleinement son rôle de ""socle de la confiance"" pour nos institutions, j'en suis
            
convaincu. Nous continuons à compter sur vous!

Speech by President Herman Van Rompuy at the Annual Conference of EU Heads of Delegation,04-09-2013,European Council,H. van Rompuy,2318," EN               EUROPEA? COU?CIL              THE PRESIDE?T              Brussels, 4 September 2013              EUCO 178/13              PRESSE 362              PR PCE 156               Speech by President of the European Council              Herman Van Rompuy              at the Annual Conference of EU Heads of Delegation              It's a pleasure to speak again at your Annual Conference, already for the fourth time. I              enjoyed our discussion last year, and look forward to our dialogue today.              Since last September, I have met many of you again – in your host capitals or here in              Brussels. I should like to thank you and your teams warmly once again for all the support              you have given me – with reports and advice, with hospitality and assistance, and always              with irreplaceable insights! Merci à toutes et à tous !              Today I should like to open with how I assess the current state of play in Europe,              economically and politically, before moving to how the European Council sees Europe's              role in the world. So first on where we stand internally.              In dealing with the crisis, the last twelve months have made a difference. Unlike a year              ago, it is now widely recognised that the eurozone will remain intact. It is even expanding,              with the adhesion of Latvia! National efforts, our collective work (not least to establish a              banking union), and also the commitments taken by the ECB – all this helped bring back              confidence.              Our partners in the world, who often underestimated in the past our political will to              maintain the euro and the Union, now acknowledge this too. In a sense, as I've said since              last October, the ""existential crisis"" of the eurozone is over. But the economic crisis, that of              growth and employment, is still with us. So jobs and growth remain the top priority.              Stability was always only a precondition.               PRESS              Dirk De Backer - Spokesperson of the President - ( +32 (0)2 281 9768 - +32 (0)497 59 99 19              Preben Aamann - Deputy Spokesperson of the President - ( +32 (0)2 281 2060 - +32 (0)476 85 05 43               press.president@consilium.europa.eu http://www.european-council.europa.eu/the-president               EUCO 178/13               1               E?               The determination, the common purpose of European leaders in fighting the crisis have              been very clear throughout all our summits. All along, we shared four central objectives:              First, restoring and preserving financial stability;              Secondly, making our economies more resilient, through sound public finances and              structural reforms;              Thirdly, immediate measures to help spur growth and employment, especially for young              people;              Fourth and finally, strengthening the architecture of the Economic and Monetary Union              (not least with the banking union).              Our tenacity has helped strengthen our credibility, and we're starting to see concrete              results. Positive signs, in the past few weeks, pointing towards recovery; uneven across              countries, modest, perhaps fragile, yet positive.              I'm all in favour of joining the voices who warn in chorus: ""No complacency!"" Absolutely:              light-heartedness could even put past efforts and achievements at risk. We all have the duty              to remain alert, to keep pushing forward reforms that support growth and jobs and help              ensure sound public finances. That's why the European Council intends to take further              decisions on growth, and for the Economic and Monetary Union. Yet I am a simple mind,              and faced with the choice, I somehow prefer positive signs to negative ones…There are              green shoots and we must nurture them with care.              Words matter, provided they are credible. All the more since the economic crisis is in part              (and certainly in the west of Europe) a crisis of confidence. It's impacted everyone's              growth. Not surprisingly, if you consider how bad two pillars of our economies were              shaken, the banks and currency. It's normal confidence takes time to return. As a Dutch              proverb says: ""Confidence leaves on horseback, and returns on foot."" Indeed. But even on              foot, it is coming back. And we are working hard to support it, all across Europe.              I'm aware that these considerations on the recovery in Europe may seem out-of-synch. For              there's a time-lag before growth starts translating into jobs, into salaries, into better living              standards. Nor does it translate easily into support for the European idea by the public at              large.              Paradoxically, as immediate dangers are receding, discontent towards Europe comes to the              fore. In this respect, the European elections next year will be an important test. To regain              the public's trust, we need first of all the economic recovery, we need results in terms of              stability, growth and jobs, and people to realise again that Europe is not the problem, but              part of the solution.              It's precisely in times of rising euro-scepticism that we need to convince people that, given              today's challenges at home and abroad, we must work much more closely together, not              less, especially in the eurozone. Europe is the best way for us to weigh in the world. And              your work, representing the Union across the globe, is a key element in that story.              I do know this diplomatic work is far from easy, and I shall stop my high note here.The              events at our southern borders of the past few weeks and months painfully remind us of              some of the limits of our political and military action, of our influence. A matter for              reflection for the democracies of the West.               EUCO 178/13               2               E?               I was struck, when I visited Egypt this January, by the polarisation of positions. The              shocking killings in August took over 1000 lives. This could have been avoided.              After those violent events, the space for politics has further reduced. I applaud Catherine              Ashton's efforts to mediate between parties. We must do all we can to revive dialogue, to              avoid that the political spirit of Tahir is put back in the bottle. The country needs to find              the path towards reconciliation The economic situation threatens to complicate matters              further and needs to be addressed structurally.              The situation is even darker in Syria. A hundred thousand dead, two million refugees. The              cynical use of chemical weapons against civilians: a blatant violation of international law              and a crime against humanity. The international community cannot allow this dreadful              precedent to be set: there can be no impunity.              But even in such tumultuous days, calls for responsible action must include the long-term              view. All outside parties agree that there is no military solution to the Syrian conflict. Only              a political solution can end the terrible bloodshed, the destruction of Syria. It is time for the              international community to put aside their differences and bring the parties to the conflict              to the negotiations table. As the largest donor, we the European Union will uphold our              commitment to provide aid and assistance to those in need in Syria and in the region.              More generally, the situation Northern Africa and the Middle East will no doubt remain a              main concern for us. I continue to believe it is in our interest, short-term and long-term, to              support democracy in the Arab world. The whole region is undergoing a tectonic shift. It              will take time to find a stable equilibrium. But the people will not accept a return to              dictatorship. Peace and democracy can only come through reconciliation and dialogue.              This is what is sorely needed these days.              There's talk of negotiations between Israel and Palestine, in Egypt, in Syria, with Iran… In              all cases, it takes more than just accepting to speak, it takes the will to accept the existence              of the other side, the will to find common solutions. Throughout the whole of Africa, the              EU is thoroughly involved – from piracy fighting and state-building in Somalia to              stabilising Mali and the wider Sahel, just to take two issues on which I'm personally              engaged. Africa is changing fast, democratically and economically. There are successstories but also new areas of instability and terrorism.              Next Spring we'll see the fourth EU-Africa Summit here in Brussels, the first ever              multilateral Leaders Summit hosted by the EU. Quite an organisational challenge! I know              many of you will be directly involved and, as the chair and host, I am grateful for this work              that will bring together so many strands of political, development-, humanitarian and              economic action.              Turning east, to the neighbours on our own continent, we feel our common strength even              more clearly. In particular for enlargement towards the Balkans, 2013 will have been a              good year. Croatia became the Union's 28th member. The agreement our High              Representative brokered between Belgrade and Pristina helped unlock the accession              process for Serbia, brought Kosovo closer to the EU and placed Kosovo/Serbia relations on              a path towards normalisation. Of course this spirit has to be maintained.               EUCO 178/13               3               E?               I traveled to both capitals immediately after the important decision at the June European              Council, to convey our political message at the highest level. The welcoming I received              leaves no doubt that it was well understood and appreciated. A page has been turned, and              hopefully it will trigger a positive dynamic elsewhere in the region.              Between the Middle-East and the Balkans: Turkey remains a key partner for the European              Union. I visited Ankara last May – in fact right before the Taksim events. The Turkish call              for a solid relation with us was very clear. Prime Minister Erdogan summarised his              requests with the following words: ""Chapters, chapters, chapters"". – The accession process              is indeed a key motor for reform. The government's reaction to popular protests last June              has affected our already complex relations. Post-Taksim, we need to see where things              stand and be ready for re-engagement (following the decision by ministers on the              conditional opening of chapter 22). Here as well, I remain ready to play my role.              The Eastern Partnership summit that we will hold in Vilnius in November could be highly              significant. The signing of the partnership agreement with Ukraine, a real test for the              Eastern Partnership as a whole, will be on the table. It requires further important steps from              Ukraine. It's an historic opportunity for them, and we will remain in contact with President              Yanukovich on this issue.              It is not my intention to take you on a full tour d'horizon. Let me just briefly mention three              further issues of particular interest to the Presidents and Prime Ministers in the European              Council: trade; defence; and our key strategic partners.              On trade, in the absence of real multilateral progress, the Union is promoting ambitious              bilateral ties with world trading powers. Foreign trade resonates in all our member states as              a motor for growth. I know it requires much of your time and attention, from Japan to              Canada, Vietnam to India, and in many South-American countries, including through              Mercosur.              Then there's the trade negotiations with the United States. Their impact will go way              beyond the Atlantic shores. And the Atlantic is not just an ocean of past glories; it's also              full of promises for the future.              Europe is more than a trade bloc. Upon my proposal, the upcoming December European              Council will look in depth at Defence – in fact for the first time in six years. We will do so              both from a growth-and-employment perspective and to improve Europe's defence              capabilities, for member states individually and collectively. We all know the dual              challenges behind this: national defence budgets have been decreasing for the last ten years              and, clearly, the world is not becoming a safer place. Although I'm convinced that only              political solutions can truly last, and that military strength plays another role now than it              did in Cold War days, we need to be able to deal with crises and play our role.              A word, to conclude, on our relations with strategic partners. I have been meeting and              working with world leaders for the last three years and have established personal relations              with many of them. The post-Lisbon stability of EU institutions helps bring clarity and              continuity.               EUCO 178/13               4               E?               In my experience, relations with the EU continue to be central for most leaders. This is true              for big powers such as China and Russia. For his very last summit, Wen Jiabao came to              Brussels, bringing a proposal to shape EU-China relations for the next decade. We have              twice yearly summits with Russia; and with President Obama, last June, we opened the              Transatlantic trade negotiations.              It is also true for other strategic partners such as Korea, Mexico, South Africa (with a              recent summit on Nelson Mandela's birthday this summer), and Japan (with a new              encounter scheduled for November). And this is of course but the top of the iceberg, of all              the work and interaction carried out by you and your teams.              Encore beaucoup plus devrait être dit sur nos relations avec l'Asie, l'Afrique ou l'Amérique,              mais dans l'intérêt de nos échanges dans un instant, je vous dois d'être bref. Je me suis donc              limité à rappeler les quelques lignes de force de notre action commune, du point de vue du              Conseil européen: notre vaste voisinage, nos relations commerciales mondiales, notre              capacité de défense et d'action face aux crises, nos rapports avec les autres grandes              puissances.              Fin 2012, en acceptant le Prix Nobel de la Paix au nom de l'Union européenne, nous avons              pu dire encore une fois, au monde entier, le sens profond de notre projet européen et de sa              projection internationale. Et je remercie tous ceux d'entre vous qui avez fait partager ce              moment autour de vous dans les pays où vous représentez notre Union.              Ce sens profond de notre projet s'ancre dans un passé tragique, mais il puise ses forces              dans les défis énormes qu'offre le monde d'aujourd'hui. Dans un monde où le poids              économique de l'Occident diminue d'année en année, nos valeurs continuent de              s'universaliser. C'est un autre paradoxe, qui est aussi notre chance. Je peux, moi, en parler,              mais en fin de compte, c'est votre action, Excellences, qui contribue de façon éloquente à              rendre ce sens et ces forces visibles, à tous nos citoyens, et en particulier aux générations              futures. Je compte sur vous. Merci.               EUCO 178/13               5               E?

Speech by President of the European Council
            
Herman Van Rompuy
            
at the Annual Conference of EU Heads of Delegation
            
It's a pleasure to speak again at your Annual Conference, already for the fourth time. I
            
enjoyed our discussion last year, and look forward to our dialogue today.
            
Since last September, I have met many of you again – in your host capitals or here in
            
Brussels. I should like to thank you and your teams warmly once again for all the support
            
you have given me – with reports and advice, with hospitality and assistance, and always
            
with irreplaceable insights! Merci à toutes et à tous !
            
Today I should like to open with how I assess the current state of play in Europe,
            
economically and politically, before moving to how the European Council sees Europe's
            
role in the world. So first on where we stand internally.
            
In dealing with the crisis, the last twelve months have made a difference. Unlike a year
            
ago, it is now widely recognised that the eurozone will remain intact. It is even expanding,
            
with the adhesion of Latvia! National efforts, our collective work (not least to establish a
            
banking union), and also the commitments taken by the ECB – all this helped bring back
            
confidence.
            
Our partners in the world, who often underestimated in the past our political will to
            
maintain the euro and the Union, now acknowledge this too. In a sense, as I've said since
            
last October, the ""existential crisis"" of the eurozone is over. But the economic crisis, that of
            
growth and employment, is still with us. So jobs and growth remain the top priority.
            
Stability was always only a precondition.

E?
            

The determination, the common purpose of European leaders in fighting the crisis have
            
been very clear throughout all our summits. All along, we shared four central objectives:
            
First, restoring and preserving financial stability;
            
Secondly, making our economies more resilient, through sound public finances and
            
structural reforms;
            
Thirdly, immediate measures to help spur growth and employment, especially for young
            
people;
            
Fourth and finally, strengthening the architecture of the Economic and Monetary Union
            
(not least with the banking union).
            
Our tenacity has helped strengthen our credibility, and we're starting to see concrete
            
results. Positive signs, in the past few weeks, pointing towards recovery; uneven across
            
countries, modest, perhaps fragile, yet positive.
            
I'm all in favour of joining the voices who warn in chorus: ""No complacency!"" Absolutely:
            
light-heartedness could even put past efforts and achievements at risk. We all have the duty
            
to remain alert, to keep pushing forward reforms that support growth and jobs and help
            
ensure sound public finances. That's why the European Council intends to take further
            
decisions on growth, and for the Economic and Monetary Union. Yet I am a simple mind,
            
and faced with the choice, I somehow prefer positive signs to negative ones…There are
            
green shoots and we must nurture them with care.
            
Words matter, provided they are credible. All the more since the economic crisis is in part
            
(and certainly in the west of Europe) a crisis of confidence. It's impacted everyone's
            
growth. Not surprisingly, if you consider how bad two pillars of our economies were
            
shaken, the banks and currency. It's normal confidence takes time to return. As a Dutch
            
proverb says: ""Confidence leaves on horseback, and returns on foot."" Indeed. But even on
            
foot, it is coming back. And we are working hard to support it, all across Europe.
            
I'm aware that these considerations on the recovery in Europe may seem out-of-synch. For
            
there's a time-lag before growth starts translating into jobs, into salaries, into better living
            
standards. Nor does it translate easily into support for the European idea by the public at
            
large.
            
Paradoxically, as immediate dangers are receding, discontent towards Europe comes to the
            
fore. In this respect, the European elections next year will be an important test. To regain
            
the public's trust, we need first of all the economic recovery, we need results in terms of
            
stability, growth and jobs, and people to realise again that Europe is not the problem, but
            
part of the solution.
            
It's precisely in times of rising euro-scepticism that we need to convince people that, given
            
today's challenges at home and abroad, we must work much more closely together, not
            
less, especially in the eurozone. Europe is the best way for us to weigh in the world. And
            
your work, representing the Union across the globe, is a key element in that story.
            
I do know this diplomatic work is far from easy, and I shall stop my high note here.The
            
events at our southern borders of the past few weeks and months painfully remind us of
            
some of the limits of our political and military action, of our influence. A matter for
            
reflection for the democracies of the West.

E?
            

I was struck, when I visited Egypt this January, by the polarisation of positions. The
            
shocking killings in August took over 1000 lives. This could have been avoided.
            
After those violent events, the space for politics has further reduced. I applaud Catherine
            
Ashton's efforts to mediate between parties. We must do all we can to revive dialogue, to
            
avoid that the political spirit of Tahir is put back in the bottle. The country needs to find
            
the path towards reconciliation The economic situation threatens to complicate matters
            
further and needs to be addressed structurally.
            
The situation is even darker in Syria. A hundred thousand dead, two million refugees. The
            
cynical use of chemical weapons against civilians: a blatant violation of international law
            
and a crime against humanity. The international community cannot allow this dreadful
            
precedent to be set: there can be no impunity.
            
But even in such tumultuous days, calls for responsible action must include the long-term
            
view. All outside parties agree that there is no military solution to the Syrian conflict. Only
            
a political solution can end the terrible bloodshed, the destruction of Syria. It is time for the
            
international community to put aside their differences and bring the parties to the conflict
            
to the negotiations table. As the largest donor, we the European Union will uphold our
            
commitment to provide aid and assistance to those in need in Syria and in the region.
            
More generally, the situation Northern Africa and the Middle East will no doubt remain a
            
main concern for us. I continue to believe it is in our interest, short-term and long-term, to
            
support democracy in the Arab world. The whole region is undergoing a tectonic shift. It
            
will take time to find a stable equilibrium. But the people will not accept a return to
            
dictatorship. Peace and democracy can only come through reconciliation and dialogue.
            
This is what is sorely needed these days.
            
There's talk of negotiations between Israel and Palestine, in Egypt, in Syria, with Iran… In
            
all cases, it takes more than just accepting to speak, it takes the will to accept the existence
            
of the other side, the will to find common solutions. Throughout the whole of Africa, the
            
EU is thoroughly involved – from piracy fighting and state-building in Somalia to
            
stabilising Mali and the wider Sahel, just to take two issues on which I'm personally
            
engaged. Africa is changing fast, democratically and economically. There are successstories but also new areas of instability and terrorism.
            
Next Spring we'll see the fourth EU-Africa Summit here in Brussels, the first ever
            
multilateral Leaders Summit hosted by the EU. Quite an organisational challenge! I know
            
many of you will be directly involved and, as the chair and host, I am grateful for this work
            
that will bring together so many strands of political, development-, humanitarian and
            
economic action.
            
Turning east, to the neighbours on our own continent, we feel our common strength even
            
more clearly. In particular for enlargement towards the Balkans, 2013 will have been a
            
good year. Croatia became the Union's 28th member. The agreement our High
            
Representative brokered between Belgrade and Pristina helped unlock the accession
            
process for Serbia, brought Kosovo closer to the EU and placed Kosovo/Serbia relations on
            
a path towards normalisation. Of course this spirit has to be maintained.

I traveled to both capitals immediately after the important decision at the June European
            
Council, to convey our political message at the highest level. The welcoming I received
            
leaves no doubt that it was well understood and appreciated. A page has been turned, and
            
hopefully it will trigger a positive dynamic elsewhere in the region.
            
Between the Middle-East and the Balkans: Turkey remains a key partner for the European
            
Union. I visited Ankara last May – in fact right before the Taksim events. The Turkish call
            
for a solid relation with us was very clear. Prime Minister Erdogan summarised his
            
requests with the following words: ""Chapters, chapters, chapters"". – The accession process
            
is indeed a key motor for reform. The government's reaction to popular protests last June
            
has affected our already complex relations. Post-Taksim, we need to see where things
            
stand and be ready for re-engagement (following the decision by ministers on the
            
conditional opening of chapter 22). Here as well, I remain ready to play my role.
            
The Eastern Partnership summit that we will hold in Vilnius in November could be highly
            
significant. The signing of the partnership agreement with Ukraine, a real test for the
            
Eastern Partnership as a whole, will be on the table. It requires further important steps from
            
Ukraine. It's an historic opportunity for them, and we will remain in contact with President
            
Yanukovich on this issue.
            
It is not my intention to take you on a full tour d'horizon. Let me just briefly mention three
            
further issues of particular interest to the Presidents and Prime Ministers in the European
            
Council: trade; defence; and our key strategic partners.
            
On trade, in the absence of real multilateral progress, the Union is promoting ambitious
            
bilateral ties with world trading powers. Foreign trade resonates in all our member states as
            
a motor for growth. I know it requires much of your time and attention, from Japan to
            
Canada, Vietnam to India, and in many South-American countries, including through
            
Mercosur.
            
Then there's the trade negotiations with the United States. Their impact will go way
            
beyond the Atlantic shores. And the Atlantic is not just an ocean of past glories; it's also
            
full of promises for the future.
            
Europe is more than a trade bloc. Upon my proposal, the upcoming December European
            
Council will look in depth at Defence – in fact for the first time in six years. We will do so
            
both from a growth-and-employment perspective and to improve Europe's defence
            
capabilities, for member states individually and collectively. We all know the dual
            
challenges behind this: national defence budgets have been decreasing for the last ten years
            
and, clearly, the world is not becoming a safer place. Although I'm convinced that only
            
political solutions can truly last, and that military strength plays another role now than it
            
did in Cold War days, we need to be able to deal with crises and play our role.
            
A word, to conclude, on our relations with strategic partners. I have been meeting and
            
working with world leaders for the last three years and have established personal relations
            
with many of them. The post-Lisbon stability of EU institutions helps bring clarity and
            
continuity.

In my experience, relations with the EU continue to be central for most leaders. This is true
            
for big powers such as China and Russia. For his very last summit, Wen Jiabao came to
            
Brussels, bringing a proposal to shape EU-China relations for the next decade. We have
            
twice yearly summits with Russia; and with President Obama, last June, we opened the
            
Transatlantic trade negotiations.
            
It is also true for other strategic partners such as Korea, Mexico, South Africa (with a
            
recent summit on Nelson Mandela's birthday this summer), and Japan (with a new
            
encounter scheduled for November). And this is of course but the top of the iceberg, of all
            
the work and interaction carried out by you and your teams.
            
Encore beaucoup plus devrait être dit sur nos relations avec l'Asie, l'Afrique ou l'Amérique,
            
mais dans l'intérêt de nos échanges dans un instant, je vous dois d'être bref. Je me suis donc
            
limité à rappeler les quelques lignes de force de notre action commune, du point de vue du
            
Conseil européen: notre vaste voisinage, nos relations commerciales mondiales, notre
            
capacité de défense et d'action face aux crises, nos rapports avec les autres grandes
            
puissances.
            
Fin 2012, en acceptant le Prix Nobel de la Paix au nom de l'Union européenne, nous avons
            
pu dire encore une fois, au monde entier, le sens profond de notre projet européen et de sa
            
projection internationale. Et je remercie tous ceux d'entre vous qui avez fait partager ce
            
moment autour de vous dans les pays où vous représentez notre Union.
            
Ce sens profond de notre projet s'ancre dans un passé tragique, mais il puise ses forces
            
dans les défis énormes qu'offre le monde d'aujourd'hui. Dans un monde où le poids
            
économique de l'Occident diminue d'année en année, nos valeurs continuent de
            
s'universaliser. C'est un autre paradoxe, qui est aussi notre chance. Je peux, moi, en parler,
            
mais en fin de compte, c'est votre action, Excellences, qui contribue de façon éloquente à
            
rendre ce sens et ces forces visibles, à tous nos citoyens, et en particulier aux générations
            
futures. Je compte sur vous. Merci.

Back in 1922, when this Tokyo-born young aristocrat living in Vienna started to campaign              for the European idea, it was just that: an idea. Hapless, it seemed, and utopian. But in the              uncertainty of the times, right after the worst war in the history of mankind, the idea struck              a chord.              The young Coudenhove-Kalergi deeply believed that the cycle of destructive wars could be              stopped, that the power of persuasion – including his own sense of persuasion – could              change the course of history.              And he was right. His belief had a name: Europa. It was not the belief in one system of              government over another. No, he believed in Europe as a civilization. A unique continent,              defined less by its geographic borders than by the wealth and diversity of its culture, as              well as by its core values: human dignity, and freedom. We recognise it: it’s our Europe.              Coudenhove-Kalergi devoted his life to making this European idea become alive – by              writing, speaking, organising, convincing.              Today, here we are in Vienna, 90 years later.Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi would have              been surprised to look at the world surrounding us. Of course he did live to see FrancoGerman reconciliation – embodied by the Elysée Treaty of 1963, or Friendship Treaty. I              like this word 'friendship' – Traité d'amitié, Freundschaftsvertrag: it gives a human touch              to interstate relations.              Attending the ceremony in the Reims Cathedral, at the personal invitation of President De              Gaulle, must have been one of the most rewarding moments of his life. Of course he did              see our continent rise from the ashes after 1945: the return of prosperity and employment              for most citizens, at least in Western Europe. But he did not live to see the end of the reign              of Communism in the Eastern half of the continent, communism which he fought his              whole life.              Nor did he see Europe's political journey, from a market and a trade bloc to a full-blown              political entity with its own Parliament, its own currency, its own flag, a common foreign              policy. And even its own unofficial capital, Brussels, a choice he had remarkably foreseen              already in 1934!              So I imagine he would certainly have been pleasantly surprised to find out today that 27,              soon to be 28 European states, many from Eastern and Central Europe, belong to our one              and single Union. Remember that when Coudenhove died, in 1972, the countries within the              then Community were still only Six, the founding states, and about to become Nine. If you              allow me a side note – there is another thing, which on the contrary would not have              surprised him: the rise of non-European powers.              As he wrote in Pan-Europa: “Kann Europa in seiner politischen und wirtschaftlichen              Zersplitterung seinen Frieden und seine Selbständigkeit den wachsenden außereuropäischen Weltmächten gegenüber währen – oder ist es gezwungen, sich zur Rettung              seiner Existenz zu einem Staatenbunde zu organisieren?”               EUCO 221/12               2               E?               In 1923, it is an incredibly early acknowledgment that European nations, even the              mightiest among them, were losing their place in global affairs. The names of the              challengers may have changed, but it is as true today as it was back then.              You often read that political Europe was born after the Second World War, thanks to men              like Robert Schuman and Konrad Adenauer who founded the European Communities,              forerunners of our Union. It is true, but not the whole truth. In politics, the intellectual              groundwork is essential; there the Pan-European Movement played an indispensable role              before 1945. Just as the American abolitionist movement, through decades of writing and              action, prepared the ground for President Abraham Lincoln to be able to finally abolish              slavery, so Pan-Europa, in making the idea of a united Europe conceivable, denkbar, for              many more people than ever before, …so Pan-Europa made it possible for Monnet and              Schuman to seize the moment in 1950.              For Coudenhove’s “Pan-Europa”, the moment was certainly fertile, so shortly after the              First World War. The movement showed the way on how to avoid a new war, how to              guarantee peace.But unfortunately, we needed a Second World War, before the moment              was really ripe for this message of peace and action. And for that delay, in those dramatic              years 1939-1945, we Europeans paid a heavy prize...              The question for us today still is: Do we need Europe in order to preserve peace? Do we              still need people to carry and promote the idea of Europe? Yes, we do. I personally have              always been convinced of this. Ultimately, peace is at the heart of what we are doing as a              Union. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has reminded us recently of this elementary fact.              The award of the Nobel Peace Prize is a great tribute to past achievements: how the              European Union helped transform a continent of wars into a continent of peace. In these              times of uncertainty it is also an encouragement to continue our work.              And I am thinking first of all of the Union’s work on enlargement, in particular in the              Western Balkans. Here in Austria you are deeply aware of the stakes, of the disruptive              force of violent nationalism, which in the past century so cruelly affected Central Europe.              Your neighbour Slovenia has been a member of the Union for over eight years now;              Croatia will join mid next year. Serbia became a candidate country this spring, joining in              this respect Montenegro, and also your country, President Ivanov.              Ever since I took up my mandate as President of the European Council, I have defended              the European perspective for the Western Balkans. Their (and your) wish to join our Union              follows barbaric and violent times, which we had thought impossible in post-1945 Europe.              But that is even more of a reason to welcome these countries. Almost all the current              members of the Union have experienced great upheavals within living memory. It is true              for Germany, France and the other founders after the destruction of the Second World War.              It is true for Greece, Spain and Portugal after the end of their dictatorships. It is true for the              former communist countries that joined us after the Wall came down.               EUCO 221/12               3               E?               In every enlargement, the Union has absorbed the shocks. As an anchor of stability. As a              haven of prosperity and freedom. As a warrantor of peace. The entry of the WesternBalkans into the Union will seal an end to the last civil war in Europe's long history – no              more, no less.              So to those who say that war is so distant in our past that peace cannot be a key issue in              Europe anymore, that the idea of preserving peace does not appeal to the younger              generations, I answer: just go out there and ask the people! And ask the younger ones too!              There is still a way to go before all Balkan countries are integrated the European Union,              but I am convinced that together, we can overcome all the obstacles on the road. In the              name of peace in Europe, we simply must! For me, our efforts for the last three years to              overcome the economic and financial crisis in Europe must also be seen in this light.              Dealing with the debt crisis that started in Greece in early 2010 has been defining for my              mandate as President of the European Council. Here I will not enter into all the important              measures that we decided to help the situation improve: rescue mechanisms, better              surveillance of budgets, bubbles and banks. Nor will I enter into the interplay of all the              European and national leaders and institutions involved in achieving this.              No, the essence is this. We are doing all this not only for the sake of balance-sheets and              healthy economies – although high unemployment is undermining the support for national              and European policies. We are doing this also for eminently political reasons. To keep our              Union together. To preserve, beyond monetary stability, the security of our countries, our              societies, our citizens tout court. To make sure we can deal jointly with the challenges of              tomorrow.              When I chair summit meetings that bring together 27 Presidents and Prime Ministers, I can              feel this political conviction very strongly around the table. We have expressed it              numerous times, in very simple words: ”We will do whatever is required to maintain the              monetary stability of the euro area.” Some were sceptical, others complained it was too              little and too late. But we have proven over and over again that we did what had to be              done, and that leaders were capable of convincing sometimes reluctant parliaments and              public opinions to follow along the way. The existential threat of a year ago now lies              behind us. But if ever it re-emerged, from this experience it is my strong conviction that              Europe will act again.              All along we have acted upon two basic principles: responsibility and solidarity. They must              also guide all future action. Responsibility of each to do its part of the work, and solidarity              from all with those who need it. Especially within the eurozone, these are two sides of the              same coin. We will only come out of this together: Wir sind ein Schicksalgemeinschaft, to              use a word of which the author of Pan-Europa was fond.              This is why I think that the work of Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, that already almost              spans a century now, will stretch deep into the future and continue to inspire the              generations to come. Europe is only at its beginning.               EUCO 221/12               4               E?               I know everyone in this room is conscious that the idea of Europe didn't only need              engagement, support, before becoming a political reality. No, it still does, even now this              reality exists. But I am confident in Europe's future. What we have built in over 60 years              cannot easily be destroyed. The forces which hold the Union together are stronger than              those that undermine it.              Right after my speech, according to the programme, we will have the pleasure to listen to              the European anthem – Alle Menschen werden Brüder...              I have to confess it is only whilst preparing this visit that I found out that the choice for the              anthem was the suggestion of no other than Count Coudenhove-Kalergi himself, back in              1955. It shows that this man of ideas or rather, this man of a single, great and generous              idea, was above all a man of action. In politics, after all, words are in fact deeds, and so are              symbols.              For Europa, our Europe, the challenge was then and still is today: winning the hearts and              marking the minds of the people. We can have treaties and institutions, we can have a              Bank and a currency, we can meet among leaders and decide, but all this activity only finds              its fulfilment with the consent of the Europeans.              I thank you all for your contribution to this great endeavour.

E?
            

Back in 1922, when this Tokyo-born young aristocrat living in Vienna started to campaign
            
for the European idea, it was just that: an idea. Hapless, it seemed, and utopian. But in the
            
uncertainty of the times, right after the worst war in the history of mankind, the idea struck
            
a chord.
            
The young Coudenhove-Kalergi deeply believed that the cycle of destructive wars could be
            
stopped, that the power of persuasion – including his own sense of persuasion – could
            
change the course of history.
            
And he was right. His belief had a name: Europa. It was not the belief in one system of
            
government over another. No, he believed in Europe as a civilization. A unique continent,
            
defined less by its geographic borders than by the wealth and diversity of its culture, as
            
well as by its core values: human dignity, and freedom. We recognise it: it’s our Europe.
            
Coudenhove-Kalergi devoted his life to making this European idea become alive – by
            
writing, speaking, organising, convincing.
            
Today, here we are in Vienna, 90 years later.Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi would have
            
been surprised to look at the world surrounding us. Of course he did live to see FrancoGerman reconciliation – embodied by the Elysée Treaty of 1963, or Friendship Treaty. I
            
like this word 'friendship' – Traité d'amitié, Freundschaftsvertrag: it gives a human touch
            
to interstate relations.
            
Attending the ceremony in the Reims Cathedral, at the personal invitation of President De
            
Gaulle, must have been one of the most rewarding moments of his life. Of course he did
            
see our continent rise from the ashes after 1945: the return of prosperity and employment
            
for most citizens, at least in Western Europe. But he did not live to see the end of the reign
            
of Communism in the Eastern half of the continent, communism which he fought his
            
whole life.
            
Nor did he see Europe's political journey, from a market and a trade bloc to a full-blown
            
political entity with its own Parliament, its own currency, its own flag, a common foreign
            
policy. And even its own unofficial capital, Brussels, a choice he had remarkably foreseen
            
already in 1934!
            
So I imagine he would certainly have been pleasantly surprised to find out today that 27,
            
soon to be 28 European states, many from Eastern and Central Europe, belong to our one
            
and single Union. Remember that when Coudenhove died, in 1972, the countries within the
            
then Community were still only Six, the founding states, and about to become Nine. If you
            
allow me a side note – there is another thing, which on the contrary would not have
            
surprised him: the rise of non-European powers.
            
As he wrote in Pan-Europa: “Kann Europa in seiner politischen und wirtschaftlichen
            
Zersplitterung seinen Frieden und seine Selbständigkeit den wachsenden außereuropäischen Weltmächten gegenüber währen – oder ist es gezwungen, sich zur Rettung
            
seiner Existenz zu einem Staatenbunde zu organisieren?”

In 1923, it is an incredibly early acknowledgment that European nations, even the
            
mightiest among them, were losing their place in global affairs. The names of the
            
challengers may have changed, but it is as true today as it was back then.
            
You often read that political Europe was born after the Second World War, thanks to men
            
like Robert Schuman and Konrad Adenauer who founded the European Communities,
            
forerunners of our Union. It is true, but not the whole truth. In politics, the intellectual
            
groundwork is essential; there the Pan-European Movement played an indispensable role
            
before 1945. Just as the American abolitionist movement, through decades of writing and
            
action, prepared the ground for President Abraham Lincoln to be able to finally abolish
            
slavery, so Pan-Europa, in making the idea of a united Europe conceivable, denkbar, for
            
many more people than ever before, …so Pan-Europa made it possible for Monnet and
            
Schuman to seize the moment in 1950.
            
For Coudenhove’s “Pan-Europa”, the moment was certainly fertile, so shortly after the
            
First World War. The movement showed the way on how to avoid a new war, how to
            
guarantee peace.But unfortunately, we needed a Second World War, before the moment
            
was really ripe for this message of peace and action. And for that delay, in those dramatic
            
years 1939-1945, we Europeans paid a heavy prize...
            
The question for us today still is: Do we need Europe in order to preserve peace? Do we
            
still need people to carry and promote the idea of Europe? Yes, we do. I personally have
            
always been convinced of this. Ultimately, peace is at the heart of what we are doing as a
            
Union. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has reminded us recently of this elementary fact.
            
The award of the Nobel Peace Prize is a great tribute to past achievements: how the
            
European Union helped transform a continent of wars into a continent of peace. In these
            
times of uncertainty it is also an encouragement to continue our work.
            
And I am thinking first of all of the Union’s work on enlargement, in particular in the
            
Western Balkans. Here in Austria you are deeply aware of the stakes, of the disruptive
            
force of violent nationalism, which in the past century so cruelly affected Central Europe.
            
Your neighbour Slovenia has been a member of the Union for over eight years now;
            
Croatia will join mid next year. Serbia became a candidate country this spring, joining in
            
this respect Montenegro, and also your country, President Ivanov.
            
Ever since I took up my mandate as President of the European Council, I have defended
            
the European perspective for the Western Balkans. Their (and your) wish to join our Union
            
follows barbaric and violent times, which we had thought impossible in post-1945 Europe.
            
But that is even more of a reason to welcome these countries. Almost all the current
            
members of the Union have experienced great upheavals within living memory. It is true
            
for Germany, France and the other founders after the destruction of the Second World War.
            
It is true for Greece, Spain and Portugal after the end of their dictatorships. It is true for the
            
former communist countries that joined us after the Wall came down.

In every enlargement, the Union has absorbed the shocks. As an anchor of stability. As a
            
haven of prosperity and freedom. As a warrantor of peace. The entry of the WesternBalkans into the Union will seal an end to the last civil war in Europe's long history – no
            
more, no less.
            
So to those who say that war is so distant in our past that peace cannot be a key issue in
            
Europe anymore, that the idea of preserving peace does not appeal to the younger
            
generations, I answer: just go out there and ask the people! And ask the younger ones too!
            
There is still a way to go before all Balkan countries are integrated the European Union,
            
but I am convinced that together, we can overcome all the obstacles on the road. In the
            
name of peace in Europe, we simply must! For me, our efforts for the last three years to
            
overcome the economic and financial crisis in Europe must also be seen in this light.
            
Dealing with the debt crisis that started in Greece in early 2010 has been defining for my
            
mandate as President of the European Council. Here I will not enter into all the important
            
measures that we decided to help the situation improve: rescue mechanisms, better
            
surveillance of budgets, bubbles and banks. Nor will I enter into the interplay of all the
            
European and national leaders and institutions involved in achieving this.
            
No, the essence is this. We are doing all this not only for the sake of balance-sheets and
            
healthy economies – although high unemployment is undermining the support for national
            
and European policies. We are doing this also for eminently political reasons. To keep our
            
Union together. To preserve, beyond monetary stability, the security of our countries, our
            
societies, our citizens tout court. To make sure we can deal jointly with the challenges of
            
tomorrow.
            
When I chair summit meetings that bring together 27 Presidents and Prime Ministers, I can
            
feel this political conviction very strongly around the table. We have expressed it
            
numerous times, in very simple words: ”We will do whatever is required to maintain the
            
monetary stability of the euro area.” Some were sceptical, others complained it was too
            
little and too late. But we have proven over and over again that we did what had to be
            
done, and that leaders were capable of convincing sometimes reluctant parliaments and
            
public opinions to follow along the way. The existential threat of a year ago now lies
            
behind us. But if ever it re-emerged, from this experience it is my strong conviction that
            
Europe will act again.
            
All along we have acted upon two basic principles: responsibility and solidarity. They must
            
also guide all future action. Responsibility of each to do its part of the work, and solidarity
            
from all with those who need it. Especially within the eurozone, these are two sides of the
            
same coin. We will only come out of this together: Wir sind ein Schicksalgemeinschaft, to
            
use a word of which the author of Pan-Europa was fond.
            
This is why I think that the work of Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, that already almost
            
spans a century now, will stretch deep into the future and continue to inspire the
            
generations to come. Europe is only at its beginning.

I know everyone in this room is conscious that the idea of Europe didn't only need
            
engagement, support, before becoming a political reality. No, it still does, even now this
            
reality exists. But I am confident in Europe's future. What we have built in over 60 years
            
cannot easily be destroyed. The forces which hold the Union together are stronger than
            
those that undermine it.
            
Right after my speech, according to the programme, we will have the pleasure to listen to
            
the European anthem – Alle Menschen werden Brüder...
            
I have to confess it is only whilst preparing this visit that I found out that the choice for the
            
anthem was the suggestion of no other than Count Coudenhove-Kalergi himself, back in
            
1955. It shows that this man of ideas or rather, this man of a single, great and generous
            
idea, was above all a man of action. In politics, after all, words are in fact deeds, and so are
            
symbols.
            
For Europa, our Europe, the challenge was then and still is today: winning the hearts and
            
marking the minds of the people. We can have treaties and institutions, we can have a
            
Bank and a currency, we can meet among leaders and decide, but all this activity only finds
            
its fulfilment with the consent of the Europeans.
            
I thank you all for your contribution to this great endeavour.

FR              M. le Président de l'Assemblée Générale, M. le Secrétaire Général des Nations-Unies,              Excellences, Mesdames et Messieurs,              L'avancée de la démocratie, qui s'est faite par grandes vagues successives depuis la              création des Nations Unies, cette avancée connaît une nouvelle accélération, dont nous              pouvons tous nous réjouir.              Sans sous-estimer les difficultés et mauvaises fortunes ailleurs, je pense notamment aux              développements positifs au Myanmar, en Somalie, aux jeunes démocraties de par le              monde, telles le Timor-Leste. Mais avant tout, c'est naturellement aux transformations à              l'œuvre dans le monde arabe que je pense aujourd'hui.              EN              When these historic changes swept through the Arab world, they stirred a mixture of deep              emotions from those watching, both within the region and beyond. There was fear: of              bloodshed and regional instability, of a rise of extremism, and uncertainty about what was              yet to come. But overwhelmingly the world looked on with solidarity, understanding and              hope.              We in Europe, geographically so close, and with our societies so deeply involved with              those in the countries experiencing these upheavals, we were also acutely aware that the              changes – and the risks and opportunities that lay ahead – would directly affect us, as              neighbours.              Of course expectations ran high. It was tempting to read the events in Tunis or Cairo as the              opening pages of a fairytale… But this is the book of history. It contains dark pages too –              some of them tragically being written at this very moment. And we are bound by a simple              truth: achieving lasting change takes time. New democratic institutions don’t run smoothly              by magic. Turning economies around or creating jobs for millions of young men and              women doesn’t happen at the wave of a wand. Deep tensions don't suddenly dissolve once              a dictator has gone.              The long path of transition lies ahead. There will undoubtedly be disappointments along              the way; there will be wrong turns, hurdles and setbacks. But I firmly believe that despite              the difficulties, this journey is heading in the right direction.              And there is no going back. Whatever the future brings, the Arab Spring will remain a              turning point. The movement is irreversible. Once the voices of the people have been set              free – an unforgettable experience for all those who were never heard before – these voices              cannot be silenced.              It is each country’s responsibility to chart its own course and to do justice to the aspirations              of its people. The European Union is committed to staying by their side every step along              the way. We are in it for the long run. I want to reaffirm: we still believe in the message of              the Arab Spring.               EUCO 178/12               2               E?               Europeans are well-placed to recognise that political change is not painless and does not              happen overnight. We know about long transitions. When European integration first              started, within my lifetime, a majority of the countries that are now its members were not              yet democracies. For us, a transition of such magnitude should not be judged by its speed              but by its direction, and by progress achieved through countless steps forward.              The starting point is free and fair elections, and we therefore salute the achievements of              Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and of other countries in successfully organising democratic              elections, in which many citizens voted freely for the very first time in their lives –              elections for which we were happy to lend expertise to national and local authorities.              In order to ultimately bring jobs, social justice and freedom of expression to all, this              gigantic democratic process will have to overcome, every single day, the obstacles of              corruption, of red tape, of economic privileges, and maintain the political determination to              ensure inclusiveness. An important effort, to which many contribute. For our part, across              the region, we offer advice to entrepreneurs and officials, we help train judges and              policemen, we support journalists and civil society groups.              In our experience societies are stronger when women are fully able to take part in the              political and economic lives of their countries, when their voices are heard, their choices              respected.              There may be temptations, once power is gained, to refuse to grant to some the rights that              until recently were withheld from all. But a democracy can only flourish when it gives all              its people -- whatever their gender, religion, language or ethnic identity -- an equal say and              equal rights, guaranteed in law and in practice.              Finally, neighbours can achieve more when they work together -- and that is why we share              experience from our own European Union on issues like connecting energy networks or              removing regional obstacles to trade.              Bringing together and reconciling former enemies in a common desire for peace,              democracy and prosperity has been one of the European Union’s great achievements.              Respect, tolerance and non-violence are the core values without which living together              harmoniously is not possible.              These are fragile values: sustaining them requires constant attention, especially in a global,              digital world, in which messages of all kind can spread faster than ever and can easily be              exploited.              Tolerance is the ability to withstand criticism, to offer dialogue, to refrain from violence;              as such it shows self-confidence. And at the same time respect for the faith and beliefs of              others is a key value for living together. Tolerance and respect acquire their full meaning in              an open society that protects freedom of expression. Each and every one of us in this room              has a responsibility in defending and promoting tolerance, in and between our countries, as              well as respect. Violence, killings as that of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, can              never be justified, regardless of their motivations.               EUCO 178/12               3               E?               Mr President, today I join the voice of Europe to those who have spoken to deplore the              civil war raging in Syria. Confronted with the massacre of tens of thousands of people, the              world has united in horror and condemnation, but -- we must be frank -- so far we have not              been able to stop the brutal violence.              Of course, Europe and others provide humanitarian support to refugees, of course we              support the individuals who risk their lives collecting evidence of the massacres, of course              our diplomats in Damascus do their utmost to support the UN's efforts for a peaceful              solution, but we will remain powerless unless the international community unites in a              common determination to end this senseless violence, which threatens to wreak havoc in              the whole region.              Mr. President, I should like to commend theexcellent work and strong commitment of the              Secretary-General, as well as that of Special Envoy Mr. Brahimi, to find a solution to              overcome this tragedy. I also welcome the initiatives aimed at bringing together the main              regional players, in a coherent international approach. Earlier this year, European leaders              called upon all Members of the Security Council to work together in an effort to stop the              violence. Today this call is even more urgent.              The country needs to advance quickly towards a Syrian-led political transition, meeting the              democratic aspirations of the Syrian people, while fully respecting the civil and human              rights of minorities. It is the only way out. And those responsible for the repression have              no place in the future of Syria and must – must – step aside.              The longer this conflict continues, the more radicalised people will become, the more              blood will needlessly be shed, and the longer it will take for the wounds to heal.              The security situation remains complex and fragile in many parts of the world. The events              of the Arab Spring should not distract us from the urgent task of achieving peace in the              Middle East -- quite the contrary.              And other issues are pressing, including: addressing instability and the humanitarian              situation in the Sahel region; bringing peace and stability to the region of the Great Lakes;              convincing the DPRK to abandon its nuclear weapons and missile programmes; and              finding a negotiated solution to the Iranian nuclear issue, a matter to which the European              Union is directly committed.              We must address all these concerns, knowing that lasting solutions require political will              from the countries involved. In the same spirit it is important that tensions in East and              South-East Asian maritime areas subside and that disputes are settled peacefully in a spirit              of cooperation and in respect of international law.              There are many global challenges that we have to tackle together. But from fighting              climate change to reducing poverty around the world, without multilateral cooperation we              will not succeed. This is why the European Union fully supports a stronger, more effective              and more efficient United Nations.               EUCO 178/12               4               E?               Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Citizens in all our countries want jobs. Here also,              global cooperation is indispensable and is the best way to ensure the world's economic              recovery.              Our economies have become completely interdependent: no country can solve its own              issues alone; no country can afford to ignore the problems of others. Do we know this?              Yes. Do we act upon this knowledge? Not enough.              In 2008, at the start of the global financial crisis, there was a brief moment of global              awareness, a sense of urgency which led to new forums, joint pledges and coordinated              action. And today, although the crisis is still with us, this post-Lehman resolve seems to              have waned, and we must revive it.              All major economies need to do their part in putting the world economy back on the path              of growth. Global growth depends on structural reforms in each of our countries and on              reducing the macro-economic imbalances between them.              Within Europe, we are doing our part of this work. No effort is spared to overcome the              current difficulties in the Eurozone. We have been setting up stronger firewalls to              guarantee the stability of our common currency; we are reforming our economies to              become more competitive and create jobs for the future. We have started building a              banking union to better manage and contain financial sector risk; and in the coming months              we will be defining the perspective for where we are headed, where we want our economic              and monetary Union to be in ten years' time.              We have come a long way already, and today we are seeing the first results of this              collective endeavour. Although there is still some way to go, I am confident that these              efforts will be met with success and that Europe will come out of this experience stronger,              economically and politically.              FR              C'est cela que je suis venu vous dire, et j'ajoute ceci: pour nous, nous Européens, dans la              gestion de cette crise financière, il ne s'agit pas juste d'opérations monétaires, d'équilibrer              des budgets: il en va de l'avenir même de notre projet européen.              Ce projet est né afin de surmonter les guerres et les dictatures qui ont pendant longtemps              hanté notre continent. Depuis soixante ans, notre Union nous a permis de venir à bout de la              haine nationaliste entre pays, et de nous constituer en un continent unifié dans la paix, dans              la quête de la justice sociale et de la prospérité. Cela demande des efforts quotidiens pour              préserver ces valeurs et approfondir leur ancrage. Rien n’est jamais acquis définitivement.              A un niveau global, c'est à cette Assemblée, aux Nations-Unies, qu'il revient d'œuvrer, sans              relâche, dans la poursuite de ces mêmes objectifs, qui nous concernent tous, pour ouvrir la              voie à plus d'harmonie et de progrès dans le monde.

Address to the 67th General Assembly of the United ?ations
            
Speaking today in New York, Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council,
            
addressed the 67th General Assembly of the United Nations on behalf of the European
            
Union.
            
Focusing his intervention on developments in the Arab world, President Van Rompuy
            
reiterated the EU's support to the democratic transitions following the Arab Spring: ""It is
            
each country’s responsibility to chart its own course and to do justice to the aspirations of
            
its people. The European Union is committed to staying by their side every step along the
            
way. We are in it for the long run. I want to reaffirm: we still believe in the message of the
            
Arab Spring.""
            
Speaking to world leaders on the issue of recent violent protests, Herman Van Rompuy
            
stated: ""Each and every one of us in this room has a responsibility in defending and
            
promoting tolerance and respect.""
            
On the civil war raging in Syria, the President of the European Council called for a Syrianled political transition, and declared: ""Those responsible for the repression have no place
            
in the future of Syria and must step aside.""
            
Ending his intervention on the situation of the world economy, President Van Rompuy
            
called for coordinated efforts towards global economic recovery: ""Although the crisis is
            
still with us, the post-Lehman resolve seems to have waned, and we must revive it. All
            
major economies need to do their part in putting the world economy back on the path of

FR
            
M. le Président de l'Assemblée Générale, M. le Secrétaire Général des Nations-Unies,
            
Excellences, Mesdames et Messieurs,
            
L'avancée de la démocratie, qui s'est faite par grandes vagues successives depuis la
            
création des Nations Unies, cette avancée connaît une nouvelle accélération, dont nous
            
pouvons tous nous réjouir.
            
Sans sous-estimer les difficultés et mauvaises fortunes ailleurs, je pense notamment aux
            
développements positifs au Myanmar, en Somalie, aux jeunes démocraties de par le
            
monde, telles le Timor-Leste. Mais avant tout, c'est naturellement aux transformations à
            
l'œuvre dans le monde arabe que je pense aujourd'hui.
            
EN
            
When these historic changes swept through the Arab world, they stirred a mixture of deep
            
emotions from those watching, both within the region and beyond. There was fear: of
            
bloodshed and regional instability, of a rise of extremism, and uncertainty about what was
            
yet to come. But overwhelmingly the world looked on with solidarity, understanding and
            
hope.
            
We in Europe, geographically so close, and with our societies so deeply involved with
            
those in the countries experiencing these upheavals, we were also acutely aware that the
            
changes – and the risks and opportunities that lay ahead – would directly affect us, as
            
neighbours.
            
Of course expectations ran high. It was tempting to read the events in Tunis or Cairo as the
            
opening pages of a fairytale… But this is the book of history. It contains dark pages too –
            
some of them tragically being written at this very moment. And we are bound by a simple
            
truth: achieving lasting change takes time. New democratic institutions don’t run smoothly
            
by magic. Turning economies around or creating jobs for millions of young men and
            
women doesn’t happen at the wave of a wand. Deep tensions don't suddenly dissolve once
            
a dictator has gone.
            
The long path of transition lies ahead. There will undoubtedly be disappointments along
            
the way; there will be wrong turns, hurdles and setbacks. But I firmly believe that despite
            
the difficulties, this journey is heading in the right direction.
            
And there is no going back. Whatever the future brings, the Arab Spring will remain a
            
turning point. The movement is irreversible. Once the voices of the people have been set
            
free – an unforgettable experience for all those who were never heard before – these voices
            
cannot be silenced.
            
It is each country’s responsibility to chart its own course and to do justice to the aspirations
            
of its people. The European Union is committed to staying by their side every step along
            
the way. We are in it for the long run. I want to reaffirm: we still believe in the message of
            
the Arab Spring.

Europeans are well-placed to recognise that political change is not painless and does not
            
happen overnight. We know about long transitions. When European integration first
            
started, within my lifetime, a majority of the countries that are now its members were not
            
yet democracies. For us, a transition of such magnitude should not be judged by its speed
            
but by its direction, and by progress achieved through countless steps forward.
            
The starting point is free and fair elections, and we therefore salute the achievements of
            
Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and of other countries in successfully organising democratic
            
elections, in which many citizens voted freely for the very first time in their lives –
            
elections for which we were happy to lend expertise to national and local authorities.
            
In order to ultimately bring jobs, social justice and freedom of expression to all, this
            
gigantic democratic process will have to overcome, every single day, the obstacles of
            
corruption, of red tape, of economic privileges, and maintain the political determination to
            
ensure inclusiveness. An important effort, to which many contribute. For our part, across
            
the region, we offer advice to entrepreneurs and officials, we help train judges and
            
policemen, we support journalists and civil society groups.
            
In our experience societies are stronger when women are fully able to take part in the
            
political and economic lives of their countries, when their voices are heard, their choices
            
respected.
            
There may be temptations, once power is gained, to refuse to grant to some the rights that
            
until recently were withheld from all. But a democracy can only flourish when it gives all
            
its people -- whatever their gender, religion, language or ethnic identity -- an equal say and
            
equal rights, guaranteed in law and in practice.
            
Finally, neighbours can achieve more when they work together -- and that is why we share
            
experience from our own European Union on issues like connecting energy networks or
            
removing regional obstacles to trade.
            
Bringing together and reconciling former enemies in a common desire for peace,
            
democracy and prosperity has been one of the European Union’s great achievements.
            
Respect, tolerance and non-violence are the core values without which living together
            
harmoniously is not possible.
            
These are fragile values: sustaining them requires constant attention, especially in a global,
            
digital world, in which messages of all kind can spread faster than ever and can easily be
            
exploited.
            
Tolerance is the ability to withstand criticism, to offer dialogue, to refrain from violence;
            
as such it shows self-confidence. And at the same time respect for the faith and beliefs of
            
others is a key value for living together. Tolerance and respect acquire their full meaning in
            
an open society that protects freedom of expression. Each and every one of us in this room
            
has a responsibility in defending and promoting tolerance, in and between our countries, as
            
well as respect. Violence, killings as that of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, can
            
never be justified, regardless of their motivations.

Mr President, today I join the voice of Europe to those who have spoken to deplore the
            
civil war raging in Syria. Confronted with the massacre of tens of thousands of people, the
            
world has united in horror and condemnation, but -- we must be frank -- so far we have not
            
been able to stop the brutal violence.
            
Of course, Europe and others provide humanitarian support to refugees, of course we
            
support the individuals who risk their lives collecting evidence of the massacres, of course
            
our diplomats in Damascus do their utmost to support the UN's efforts for a peaceful
            
solution, but we will remain powerless unless the international community unites in a
            
common determination to end this senseless violence, which threatens to wreak havoc in
            
the whole region.
            
Mr. President, I should like to commend theexcellent work and strong commitment of the
            
Secretary-General, as well as that of Special Envoy Mr. Brahimi, to find a solution to
            
overcome this tragedy. I also welcome the initiatives aimed at bringing together the main
            
regional players, in a coherent international approach. Earlier this year, European leaders
            
called upon all Members of the Security Council to work together in an effort to stop the
            
violence. Today this call is even more urgent.
            
The country needs to advance quickly towards a Syrian-led political transition, meeting the
            
democratic aspirations of the Syrian people, while fully respecting the civil and human
            
rights of minorities. It is the only way out. And those responsible for the repression have
            
no place in the future of Syria and must – must – step aside.
            
The longer this conflict continues, the more radicalised people will become, the more
            
blood will needlessly be shed, and the longer it will take for the wounds to heal.
            
The security situation remains complex and fragile in many parts of the world. The events
            
of the Arab Spring should not distract us from the urgent task of achieving peace in the
            
Middle East -- quite the contrary.
            
And other issues are pressing, including: addressing instability and the humanitarian
            
situation in the Sahel region; bringing peace and stability to the region of the Great Lakes;
            
convincing the DPRK to abandon its nuclear weapons and missile programmes; and
            
finding a negotiated solution to the Iranian nuclear issue, a matter to which the European
            
Union is directly committed.
            
We must address all these concerns, knowing that lasting solutions require political will
            
from the countries involved. In the same spirit it is important that tensions in East and
            
South-East Asian maritime areas subside and that disputes are settled peacefully in a spirit
            
of cooperation and in respect of international law.
            
There are many global challenges that we have to tackle together. But from fighting
            
climate change to reducing poverty around the world, without multilateral cooperation we
            
will not succeed. This is why the European Union fully supports a stronger, more effective
            
and more efficient United Nations.

Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Citizens in all our countries want jobs. Here also,
            
global cooperation is indispensable and is the best way to ensure the world's economic
            
recovery.
            
Our economies have become completely interdependent: no country can solve its own
            
issues alone; no country can afford to ignore the problems of others. Do we know this?
            
Yes. Do we act upon this knowledge? Not enough.
            
In 2008, at the start of the global financial crisis, there was a brief moment of global
            
awareness, a sense of urgency which led to new forums, joint pledges and coordinated
            
action. And today, although the crisis is still with us, this post-Lehman resolve seems to
            
have waned, and we must revive it.
            
All major economies need to do their part in putting the world economy back on the path
            
of growth. Global growth depends on structural reforms in each of our countries and on
            
reducing the macro-economic imbalances between them.
            
Within Europe, we are doing our part of this work. No effort is spared to overcome the
            
current difficulties in the Eurozone. We have been setting up stronger firewalls to
            
guarantee the stability of our common currency; we are reforming our economies to
            
become more competitive and create jobs for the future. We have started building a
            
banking union to better manage and contain financial sector risk; and in the coming months
            
we will be defining the perspective for where we are headed, where we want our economic
            
and monetary Union to be in ten years' time.
            
We have come a long way already, and today we are seeing the first results of this
            
collective endeavour. Although there is still some way to go, I am confident that these
            
efforts will be met with success and that Europe will come out of this experience stronger,
            
economically and politically.

C'est cela que je suis venu vous dire, et j'ajoute ceci: pour nous, nous Européens, dans la
            
gestion de cette crise financière, il ne s'agit pas juste d'opérations monétaires, d'équilibrer
            
des budgets: il en va de l'avenir même de notre projet européen.
            
Ce projet est né afin de surmonter les guerres et les dictatures qui ont pendant longtemps
            
hanté notre continent. Depuis soixante ans, notre Union nous a permis de venir à bout de la
            
haine nationaliste entre pays, et de nous constituer en un continent unifié dans la paix, dans
            
la quête de la justice sociale et de la prospérité. Cela demande des efforts quotidiens pour
            
préserver ces valeurs et approfondir leur ancrage. Rien n’est jamais acquis définitivement.
            
A un niveau global, c'est à cette Assemblée, aux Nations-Unies, qu'il revient d'œuvrer, sans
            
relâche, dans la poursuite de ces mêmes objectifs, qui nous concernent tous, pour ouvrir la
            
voie à plus d'harmonie et de progrès dans le monde.
            
Merci.

The seamless transition of power is evidence of the deep roots of your neighbor Ghana in political democracy. This transition was much more difficult in Ivory Coast after 2010. But the restoration of democracy in this great country is all the more gratifying. The EU has supported you and support you, as a friend and partner in this democratic consolidation. It is part of the rise in recent years of a democratic Africa. Africa and Europe had much in common but the shared values ​​reinforces the unbreakable bonds. If other world powers are recently interested in your continent, know that this sharing of values ​​makes the single Europe-Africa cooperation. I commend the efforts of President Ouattara and his Government to consolidate peace and democracy and to revive the economy. Unfortunately there is no acquis in life. Remain vigilant and stay the course. Anyway significant economic successes have already been achieved. The country is on track. The economic potential is great. The challenges remain great.

Discours du Président du Conseil européen, Herman Van
            
Rompuy, à l'occasion de la fête nationale de la Côte d'Ivoire
            
Je veux tout d'abord remercier le Président de m'avoir invité à la fête nationale, célébrant le
            
cinquante-deuxième anniversaire de l'indépendance de la Côte d'Ivoire. C'est un honneur et
            
un plaisir.
            
Je viens de passer quelques jours de vacances au Ghana, malheureusement au moment du
            
décès du Président Mills. J'ai présenté au nom de l'Union européenne nos condoléances les
            
plus sincères au nouveau Président Mahama. La transition impeccable du pouvoir est une
            
preuve de l'ancrage profond de votre voisin le Ghana dans la démocratie politique.
            
Cette transition a été beaucoup plus difficile en Côte d'Ivoire après 2010. Mais la
            
restauration de la démocratie dans ce merveilleux pays est d'autant plus réjouissante. L'UE
            
vous a soutenu et vous soutiendra, en tant qu'ami et partenaire, dans cette consolidation
            
démocratique. Elle fait partie de la naissance ces dernières années d'une Afrique
            
démocratique. L'Afrique et l'Europe avaient déjà beaucoup en commun mais le partage de
            
valeurs communes renforce ces liens indestructibles. Si d'autres grandes puissances
            
mondiales s'intéressent récemment à votre continent, sachez que ce partage de valeurs rend
            
la coopération Afrique-Europe unique.
            
Je rends hommage aux efforts fournis par le Président Ouattara et par son Gouvernement
            
pour consolider la paix et la démocratie et pour relancer l'économie. Malheureusement il
            
n'y a pas d'acquis dans la vie. Il faut rester vigilant et garder le cap. En tout cas des succès
            
économiques importants ont déjà été obtenus. Le pays est sur la bonne voie. Le potentiel
            
économique est grand. Les défis restent grands. L'Union apporte son appui financier et
            
politique pour faire face aux défis qui doivent encore être relevés.

La Côte d’ivoire joue un grand rôle dans l’Afrique de l’ouest. Je salue votre action,
            
Monsieur le Président à la tête de la CEDEAO. Les crises constitutionnelles et sécuritaires
            
au Mali et en Guinée Bissau nous montrent en effet combien nous devons tous travailler
            
unis pour rétablir la stabilité et la démocratie. Partant de cette base, nous devons combattre
            
l’extrémisme, l’intolérance et le bafouage des valeurs humaines. Ici vous trouverez l’union
            
européenne à vos côtés dans un cadre international approprié.
            
Notre coopération dépasse donc largement l’aide financière. Elle est économique et
            
politique. Nos relations sont sincères, profondes et marquées par le respect et la
            
connaissance mutuelle.
            
Je saisis donc cette occasion. Monsieur le Président, pour souhaiter une heureuse fête
            
nationale, malgré les difficultés et les défis. Je la souhaite à tous les ivoiriens, sans
            
exception. L’Europe a été construite sur la réconciliation après la deuxième guerre
            
mondiale. Elle a comme devise : « Unité dans la diversité ». C’est un idéal pour beaucoup
            
d’autres pays et peuples.
            
Monsieur le Président, je suis convaincu que vous réussirez dans votre mission pour
            
redonner l’espoir à votre pays, à vos compatriotes et à la région. L’Afrique a choisi le
            
camp de la démocratie. C’est aussi un choix pour la paix et la prospérité et la justice. L’un
            
va de paire avec l’autre. L’Europe aussi surmontera ces problèmes actuels. Nous avons en
            
Europe un héritage à défendre ces jours-ci.

Dabei ist es ist nicht so wichtig, im Mittelpunkt              zu stehen, sondern zu wissen, wo die Mitte ist.              Als Gast des Landes Hessen weiß ich mich da auf ganz sicherem Terrain. Denn seit dem              Beitritt Bulgariens und Rumäniens zur EU am 1. Januar 2007 bildet Hessen, genauer              gesagt die Stadt Gelnhausen, die geografische Mitte der EU.              Das haben nicht etwa die Hessen selbst festgestellt, sondern das Nationale Geografische              Institut Frankreichs.              Und aus aktuellem Anlass füge ich beruhigend hinzu: Deutschland und Frankreich konnten              in dieser Frage unverzüglich und umfassend Einvernehmen erzielen!              Sehr geehrter Herr Ministerpräsident,              ich habe Ihre Einladung gern angenommen, bei diesem schon traditionellen Jahresempfang              die Festansprache zu halten.

Sie gestatten mir deshalb, dass ich Ihnen weniger festlich, sondern den Umständen              entsprechend eher sachlich einen Überblick über die drei Themenschwerpunkte des              Europäischen Rates gebe:              –               Die Schuldenkrise,               –               Wachstum und Beschäftigung sowie               –               die Außenbeziehungen.               Übrigens ist Hessen auch bei dieser Agenda im Zentrum des Geschehens, sei es              –               als Sitz der Europäischen Zentralbank und der Bundesbank,               –               als Innovations- und Technologiestandort mit circa 30.000 Arbeitsplätzen im              Bereich Forschung und Entwicklung oder               –               als Drehkreuz- des Luft- und Fernverkehrs mit Frankfurt als zweitgrößtem Frachtund drittgrößtem Passagierflughafen in Europa.               [EN]              Ladies and Gentlemen,              Please allow me to continue in English.              I will start with the Eurozone and the sovereign debt crisis, and share some of my              experiences from my time in office -- already two years, two long years…              I will do so in the form of five lessons about Monetary Union.              First lesson: we cannot have a common currency, a common monetary policy, and leave              everything else to the States involved. And yet this is what we have experienced. There              needs to be a coherence of policies and institutions at the European level. If, right from the              launch of the euro, we had had the instruments that we devised ""on the job"" in 2010 and              2011, we would have been spared a great many difficulties.              Until this summer, there was a struggle by Member-States to keep a grip on the              recommendations and sanctions in the context of the budgetary and macro-economic              surveillance. This resistance has been washed away by the advance of the crisis.              The second, and equally obvious, lesson: at a time of crisis, one must have the courage to              take crisis measures. We cannot deal with a crisis by applying everyday methods alone.              This has been particularly true for the European Central Bank. Under the presidency of              Jean Claude Trichet and now of Mario Draghi, it has had to work in an unfamiliar              environment, in unexplored territory. What the ECB did, had to be done to save the euro              area as such. This objective is the important thing. The means for achieving it are not an              end in themselves. Let us not forget this in the upcoming weeks.               EUCO 140/11               2               EN               Third lesson: the euro area, so we discovered, is as strong as the weakest link in the chain.              We have all become so dependent on one other that we cannot afford continuing              divergences within a monetary union. Responsibility and solidarity. Each member of the              euro area holds the fate of the whole euro area in their hands, economically and politically.              Recent events in votes and parliaments in Athens, in Bratislava, in Rome or in Helsinki              have proven it to all… I would stress that solidarity consists, therefore, not merely in              receiving but also in giving. Solidarity is a duty, not only a right. A lax national policy is              therefore contrary to the spirit of solidarity - and I do not only say this to German              audiences!              Fourth lesson: The crisis in the euro area requires us to do more, in terms of both fiscal              discipline and economic integration. This will come about through the new Stability and              Growth Pact, as well as the Euro Plus Pact. But we need to go further, and we need both              fiscal discipline and economic and fiscal integration. Not only to punish the ""sinners"", but              also to link our policies together, and demonstrate that we share a common destiny. We              need to acknowledge that this means a loss of sovereignty for all, and not only for the              countries in difficulty.              As you will know, the last Euro Summit of 26 October mandated me to present a report, in              close cooperation with the Commission President and the President of the Eurogroup, to              identify possible steps              –               to further strengthen economic convergence within the Euro area,               –               to improve fiscal discipline and               –               to deepen economic union, including exploring the possibility of limited Treaty              changes..               Firstly, as regards strengthening economic convergence, we need to examine whether to go              beyond the ""sixpack"" in terms of further macroeconomic surveillance, how to strengthen              the framework for commitments under the Euro plus Pact, and whether there are areas in              which enhanced cooperation is desirable among the 17 in areas of economic policy that are              crucial for competitiveness.              Secondly, in terms of improving fiscal discipline, should we go further in terms of the              automaticity of the sanctions provided for under the Excessive Deficit Procedure? Should              we provide, in extreme cases, for further sanctions such as a suspension of voting rights,              suspension of structural funds or other payments, or power for a central authority to              intervene in national budgetary procedures?              Thirdly and finally, in terms of deepening economic union, is there a need for              harmonisation in certain areas such as taxation or even some social fields? Should there be              a limited mutualisation of public debt? What further regulations are needed for the              financial sector?              Again, all these questions are interlinked and changes in one aspect cannot always be              assessed independently of changes in others.               EUCO 140/11               3               EN               Fifth lesson: the time horizon of a democracy is radically different from that of the              markets. They count in terms of a mouse click. We in weeks or months – and that it is              when things move speedily! So even when we would make a qualitative jump, this takes              time.              And I am not only thinking about the time of parliamentary democracies: of legislative              procedures, of votes, the work to get a majority. There are at least two other aspects to              political time: the time of public opinion, which needs to be convinced, taken along a road.              And the time of implementation, of executing the measures once they are agreed. In the              current context, both are vital too.              Ladies and Gentlemen,              All our efforts to overcome the crisis are taking place in an economic environment that has              clearly deteriorated in the past few months. The prospects for growth are now weaker - in              Europe as well as globally:              –               GDP in the EU is now projected to stagnate until well into 2012. Growth for the              whole of 2012 is only forecast at about 0.5 %. By 2013, a return to slow growth of              about 1.5 % is expected, but a year can be an eternity in today's world.               –               Unemployment is forecast to remain at the current high level of around 9.5 %,              with significant and persistent disparities between Member States. For example,              youth unemployment reached in July EU-wide 20.7 %, with less than 8 % in              Austria and the Netherlands to 46.2 % in Spain. These divergences are              inacceptable in a monetary Union.               –               Also on the global scale, the pace of world growth has been slowing over the last              months and the global economic outlook has deteriorated in recent weeks as well.               Thus enhancing growth is a global responsibility. The United States has to reduce its              public deficit and China has to stimulate its domestic demand and to increase the flexibility              of its currency rate regime.              But let us be clear: the slowing economic growth in the Eurozone is on average not due to              fiscal consolidation. It also has to do with credit restraint and a lack of confidence by              consumers as well as investors. Overall deficit spending can therefore not be the answer to              the current situation.              Ladies and Gentlemen,              As the British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg recently put it: We need a ""laserlike              focus"" on growth. - It is the condition sine qua non for the creation of jobs.              The crisis years since 2007 have accelerated certain long-term trends. Global economic              power is shifting, to the emerging countries, to the Pacific.              It now appears clearly that Europe's privileged position is not a God-given right.              However, one of the side-effects of the crisis is that today, the public at large realises that              we in Europe will not continue to out-compete and out-smart the rest of the world              automatically. We can surely do, but it will require hard work.              EUCO 140/11               4               EN               We must work hard on a positive agenda:              First point: innovation. . We must create an innovation friendly environment for our own              businesses and for foreign investors. This is indispensable for growth. Together with              Research and Development and education, innovation is probably the best example that              fiscal consolidation should not be achieved by using the 'lawnmower method'. We              therefore need to reshuffle expenditures to innovation, R&D and education. It will be a              painful, but important exercise!              As already mentioned, Hessen is a good example in this context with high-tech clusters              throughout the Land serving not only the traditional industries, but also the dynamic              service sector.              Second point: make investment and jobs a priority in the national budgets. That's why three              weeks ago, the European Council sent a strong signal for a more growth-friendly pattern of              fiscal consolidation:              –               We agreed that priority must be given to ensure the speedy deployment of the              Single Market Act. This includes the full implementation of the Services              Directive, the integrated market for energy, a better financial integration including              venture capital and the modernisation of public procurement. Further completing              the single market by these reforms would add around 3 % to the GDP level in              2020.               –               We also asked the Commission to rapidly present its proposals on the completion              of a fully integrated Digital Single Market. The total estimated value of online              transactions in Europe was around 165 billion Euro in 2010. 40 % of consumers              have used internet to purchase goods and services, but only 9 % have done so              from another Member State,               Third point: use Structural Funds for growth. Taking into account that transfers from these              funds amount up to 4 % of GDP in some Member States, we need to maximise their              growth capacity already in the current period until the end of 2013.              In the upcoming financial framework 2014 to 2020, the EU should focus ALL central              funding, to the extent possible, on growth-related measures. I therefore welcome that the              Commission has proposed to concentrate expenditure on the EU2020-targets, with a strong              focus on competitiveness and growth, on innovative financing and on macro-economic              conditionality.              Ladies and Gentlemen,              Let me finally come to the third aspect of my work as President of the European Council external relations.              The impressive economic and political shifts which we call 'globalisation' have not only              lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty; in so doing they have also drawn a              new map. Many parts of Africa and Asia have risen from poverty and show new selfconfidence, and so does South-America.               EUCO 140/11               5               EN               So let me mention the three main trends that affect us, plus one series of events.              Trend 1 - The rise of the emerged economies. China, India, Brazil and Russia and SouthAfrica consider themselves as the 5 BRICS countries. Rather than emerging, these              countries are in fact emerged economies by now. They have some of the world’s highest              growth rates.              That’s why, in our quest for economic growth, we in the EU should focus our attention and              energies to engage their growth, creating opportunities for ourselves as well.              But there is more to the BRICS than just spectacular growth. These countries are              increasing their political cooperation, for instance in the UN Security Council and in the              G20, or in the climate debate.              Certainly, the European Union has good, cooperative relations with all the BRICS              countries: each of them is a ""strategic partner"" of the EU. Yet we should find a way to              better engage these countries: from development strategies to climate change, from the              challenges of access to resources and raw materials to certain political issues of global              significance, we have numerous topics that could be discussed together.              To create new jobs, we must also improve the EU's trade performance and attract more              foreign investment. This implies a qualitative deepening of our economic and trade              relations with partners whose markets are expanding at a significant pace, such as China              and the emerging economies. Only the recently concluded Free Trade Agreement with              South Korea will generate 1.6 billion euro in customs duties per year. Once fully              implemented, it will lead to new trade opportunities of nearly 20 billion euro of additional              EU goods and services exports. Negotiations of Free Trade Agreements with India,              Mercosur and the Ukraine are pending.              Last but not least, the accession of Russia to the World Trade Organisation is one of the              most strategic issues for Europe. Opening up its economy, having to comply with              international economic law and with international economic cooperation will strengthen              the forces of modernisation in the country. Besides the finalisation of the bilateral              negotiations with Russia, the EU actively supported the Swiss-led mediation efforts              leading to the agreement between Georgia and Russia - one of the most difficult hurdles              for the Russian WTO-Accession.              Trend 2: power and influence in the world are more and more a matter of economy, and              less of weapons.              The experiences of both Iraq and Afghanistan have clearly demonstrated that long-term              stability cannot be achieved exclusively by military intervention but only through a long              term and comprehensive commitment. This is a lesson learned that we should all keep in              mind, by the way, against the background of our success so far in Libya – an intervention              justified on humanitarian grounds and carried out in accordance with international law.              Hopefully, emerging powers are also learning the lesson that they cannot rely on their              growing military muscle without the risk of isolating themselves.              In short: power no longer only comes ""from the barrel of a gun"". Stalin's question: ""The              Vatican: How many divisions?"" is no longer the central question.              EUCO 140/11               6               EN               Trend 3 - The strategic shift from the Atlantic to the Pacific              The twentieth century was an Atlantic century, while the twenty-first is going to be a              Pacific one. It is a cliché, but like in every cliché, there is a truth in it. The tendencies go              further than the well-known growth dynamics and demographics. Asia and the Pacific are              quickly emerging scientific and research powerhouses, and the region’s competitiveness is              the global standard.              Let me mention one Pacific-related issue, Europe’s relationship with the United States. Our              fundamental values of democracy, human rights and a rule-bound international order              remain common. Europeans and Americans are and were only recently peacekeeping,              fighting and working shoulder to shoulder in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Libya. Yet              with the disappearance of the common threat posed by the Soviet Union, Europe and the              U.S. no longer automatically share the same hopes and fears, an encompassing political              outlook. In a Pacific world, the concept of “the West” looses the cohesive force it had. But              there is still a ""West"" although there is no ""East"" any more.              On Iran, the new report of the International Atomic Energy Agency increases our concerns              over the nuclear programme and the lack of progress in diplomatic efforts. We will              continue to examine possible new as well as reinforced restrictive measures.              Ladies and Gentlemen,              In the European Union we are well aware that our credibility as a global player ultimately              will be judged by how we handle the neighbourhood.              This is true for the our Eastern Neighbourhood and for the Balkans. The European              perspective offered to the latter region has contributed decisively to stability and              prosperity. Even if we have not yet reached ultimate goals, the Western Balkans have a              European vocation.              This is true for the Arab Spring. The European Union is doing its utmost to push the events              in (what we consider to be) the right direction, helping those forces that work towards              democracy and economic reform benefitting the people, but we frankly do not determine              the end result - and we should not want to.

Ceremonial Address of Herman Van Rompuy
            
President of the European Council
            
at the Annual Reception 2011 of the Land Hessen

Sehr geehrter Herr Ministerpräsident,
            
sehr geehrte Damen und Herren Abgeordnete,
            
Exzellenzen,
            
meine Damen und Herren,
            
eine meiner wichtigsten Aufgaben als Präsident des Europäischen Rates ist es, zwischen
            
unterschiedlichen Positionen zu vermitteln. Dabei ist es ist nicht so wichtig, im Mittelpunkt
            
zu stehen, sondern zu wissen, wo die Mitte ist.
            
Als Gast des Landes Hessen weiß ich mich da auf ganz sicherem Terrain. Denn seit dem
            
Beitritt Bulgariens und Rumäniens zur EU am 1. Januar 2007 bildet Hessen, genauer
            
gesagt die Stadt Gelnhausen, die geografische Mitte der EU.
            
Das haben nicht etwa die Hessen selbst festgestellt, sondern das Nationale Geografische
            
Institut Frankreichs.
            
Und aus aktuellem Anlass füge ich beruhigend hinzu: Deutschland und Frankreich konnten
            
in dieser Frage unverzüglich und umfassend Einvernehmen erzielen!
            
Sehr geehrter Herr Ministerpräsident,
            
ich habe Ihre Einladung gern angenommen, bei diesem schon traditionellen Jahresempfang

Und dies gilt auch heute noch, obwohl die Lage der EU zur Zeit eigentlich keinen Anlass
            
für eine 'Festrede' bietet.
            
Sie gestatten mir deshalb, dass ich Ihnen weniger festlich, sondern den Umständen
            
entsprechend eher sachlich einen Überblick über die drei Themenschwerpunkte des
            
Europäischen Rates gebe:
            
–
            

Die Schuldenkrise,
            

–
            

Wachstum und Beschäftigung sowie
            

–
            

die Außenbeziehungen.
            

Übrigens ist Hessen auch bei dieser Agenda im Zentrum des Geschehens, sei es

als Sitz der Europäischen Zentralbank und der Bundesbank,
            

–
            

als Innovations- und Technologiestandort mit circa 30.000 Arbeitsplätzen im
            
Bereich Forschung und Entwicklung oder

[EN]
            
Ladies and Gentlemen,
            
Please allow me to continue in English.
            
I will start with the Eurozone and the sovereign debt crisis, and share some of my
            
experiences from my time in office -- already two years, two long years…
            
I will do so in the form of five lessons about Monetary Union.
            
First lesson: we cannot have a common currency, a common monetary policy, and leave
            
everything else to the States involved. And yet this is what we have experienced. There
            
needs to be a coherence of policies and institutions at the European level. If, right from the
            
launch of the euro, we had had the instruments that we devised ""on the job"" in 2010 and
            
2011, we would have been spared a great many difficulties.
            
Until this summer, there was a struggle by Member-States to keep a grip on the
            
recommendations and sanctions in the context of the budgetary and macro-economic
            
surveillance. This resistance has been washed away by the advance of the crisis.
            
The second, and equally obvious, lesson: at a time of crisis, one must have the courage to
            
take crisis measures. We cannot deal with a crisis by applying everyday methods alone.
            
This has been particularly true for the European Central Bank. Under the presidency of
            
Jean Claude Trichet and now of Mario Draghi, it has had to work in an unfamiliar
            
environment, in unexplored territory. What the ECB did, had to be done to save the euro
            
area as such. This objective is the important thing. The means for achieving it are not an
            
end in themselves. Let us not forget this in the upcoming weeks.
            

EUCO 140/11

EN
            

Third lesson: the euro area, so we discovered, is as strong as the weakest link in the chain.
            
We have all become so dependent on one other that we cannot afford continuing
            
divergences within a monetary union. Responsibility and solidarity. Each member of the
            
euro area holds the fate of the whole euro area in their hands, economically and politically.
            
Recent events in votes and parliaments in Athens, in Bratislava, in Rome or in Helsinki
            
have proven it to all… I would stress that solidarity consists, therefore, not merely in
            
receiving but also in giving. Solidarity is a duty, not only a right. A lax national policy is
            
therefore contrary to the spirit of solidarity - and I do not only say this to German
            
audiences!
            
Fourth lesson: The crisis in the euro area requires us to do more, in terms of both fiscal
            
discipline and economic integration. This will come about through the new Stability and
            
Growth Pact, as well as the Euro Plus Pact. But we need to go further, and we need both
            
fiscal discipline and economic and fiscal integration. Not only to punish the ""sinners"", but
            
also to link our policies together, and demonstrate that we share a common destiny. We
            
need to acknowledge that this means a loss of sovereignty for all, and not only for the
            
countries in difficulty.
            
As you will know, the last Euro Summit of 26 October mandated me to present a report, in
            
close cooperation with the Commission President and the President of the Eurogroup, to
            
identify possible steps
            
–
            

to further strengthen economic convergence within the Euro area,
            

–
            

to improve fiscal discipline and
            

–
            

to deepen economic union, including exploring the possibility of limited Treaty
            
changes..
            

Firstly, as regards strengthening economic convergence, we need to examine whether to go
            
beyond the ""sixpack"" in terms of further macroeconomic surveillance, how to strengthen
            
the framework for commitments under the Euro plus Pact, and whether there are areas in
            
which enhanced cooperation is desirable among the 17 in areas of economic policy that are
            
crucial for competitiveness.
            
Secondly, in terms of improving fiscal discipline, should we go further in terms of the
            
automaticity of the sanctions provided for under the Excessive Deficit Procedure? Should
            
we provide, in extreme cases, for further sanctions such as a suspension of voting rights,
            
suspension of structural funds or other payments, or power for a central authority to
            
intervene in national budgetary procedures?
            
Thirdly and finally, in terms of deepening economic union, is there a need for
            
harmonisation in certain areas such as taxation or even some social fields? Should there be
            
a limited mutualisation of public debt? What further regulations are needed for the
            
financial sector?
            
Again, all these questions are interlinked and changes in one aspect cannot always be
            
assessed independently of changes in others.

Fifth lesson: the time horizon of a democracy is radically different from that of the
            
markets. They count in terms of a mouse click. We in weeks or months – and that it is
            
when things move speedily! So even when we would make a qualitative jump, this takes
            
time.
            
And I am not only thinking about the time of parliamentary democracies: of legislative
            
procedures, of votes, the work to get a majority. There are at least two other aspects to
            
political time: the time of public opinion, which needs to be convinced, taken along a road.
            
And the time of implementation, of executing the measures once they are agreed. In the
            
current context, both are vital too.
            
Ladies and Gentlemen,
            
All our efforts to overcome the crisis are taking place in an economic environment that has
            
clearly deteriorated in the past few months. The prospects for growth are now weaker - in
            
Europe as well as globally:
            
–
            

GDP in the EU is now projected to stagnate until well into 2012. Growth for the
            
whole of 2012 is only forecast at about 0.5 %. By 2013, a return to slow growth of
            
about 1.5 % is expected, but a year can be an eternity in today's world.
            

–
            

Unemployment is forecast to remain at the current high level of around 9.5 %,
            
with significant and persistent disparities between Member States. For example,
            
youth unemployment reached in July EU-wide 20.7 %, with less than 8 % in
            
Austria and the Netherlands to 46.2 % in Spain. These divergences are
            
inacceptable in a monetary Union.
            

–
            

Also on the global scale, the pace of world growth has been slowing over the last
            
months and the global economic outlook has deteriorated in recent weeks as well.
            

Thus enhancing growth is a global responsibility. The United States has to reduce its
            
public deficit and China has to stimulate its domestic demand and to increase the flexibility
            
of its currency rate regime.
            
But let us be clear: the slowing economic growth in the Eurozone is on average not due to
            
fiscal consolidation. It also has to do with credit restraint and a lack of confidence by
            
consumers as well as investors. Overall deficit spending can therefore not be the answer to
            
the current situation.
            
Ladies and Gentlemen,
            
As the British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg recently put it: We need a ""laserlike
            
focus"" on growth. - It is the condition sine qua non for the creation of jobs.
            
The crisis years since 2007 have accelerated certain long-term trends. Global economic
            
power is shifting, to the emerging countries, to the Pacific.
            
It now appears clearly that Europe's privileged position is not a God-given right.
            
However, one of the side-effects of the crisis is that today, the public at large realises that
            
we in Europe will not continue to out-compete and out-smart the rest of the world
            
automatically. We can surely do, but it will require hard work.
            
EUCO 140/11

EN
            

We must work hard on a positive agenda:
            
First point: innovation. . We must create an innovation friendly environment for our own
            
businesses and for foreign investors. This is indispensable for growth. Together with
            
Research and Development and education, innovation is probably the best example that
            
fiscal consolidation should not be achieved by using the 'lawnmower method'. We
            
therefore need to reshuffle expenditures to innovation, R&D and education. It will be a
            
painful, but important exercise!
            
As already mentioned, Hessen is a good example in this context with high-tech clusters
            
throughout the Land serving not only the traditional industries, but also the dynamic
            
service sector.
            
Second point: make investment and jobs a priority in the national budgets. That's why three
            
weeks ago, the European Council sent a strong signal for a more growth-friendly pattern of
            
fiscal consolidation:
            
–
            

We agreed that priority must be given to ensure the speedy deployment of the
            
Single Market Act. This includes the full implementation of the Services
            
Directive, the integrated market for energy, a better financial integration including
            
venture capital and the modernisation of public procurement. Further completing
            
the single market by these reforms would add around 3 % to the GDP level in
            
2020.
            

–
            

We also asked the Commission to rapidly present its proposals on the completion
            
of a fully integrated Digital Single Market. The total estimated value of online
            
transactions in Europe was around 165 billion Euro in 2010. 40 % of consumers
            
have used internet to purchase goods and services, but only 9 % have done so
            
from another Member State,
            

Third point: use Structural Funds for growth. Taking into account that transfers from these
            
funds amount up to 4 % of GDP in some Member States, we need to maximise their
            
growth capacity already in the current period until the end of 2013.
            
In the upcoming financial framework 2014 to 2020, the EU should focus ALL central
            
funding, to the extent possible, on growth-related measures. I therefore welcome that the
            
Commission has proposed to concentrate expenditure on the EU2020-targets, with a strong
            
focus on competitiveness and growth, on innovative financing and on macro-economic
            
conditionality.
            
Ladies and Gentlemen,
            
Let me finally come to the third aspect of my work as President of the European Council external relations.
            
The impressive economic and political shifts which we call 'globalisation' have not only
            
lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty; in so doing they have also drawn a
            
new map. Many parts of Africa and Asia have risen from poverty and show new selfconfidence, and so does South-America.

So let me mention the three main trends that affect us, plus one series of events.
            
Trend 1 - The rise of the emerged economies. China, India, Brazil and Russia and SouthAfrica consider themselves as the 5 BRICS countries. Rather than emerging, these
            
countries are in fact emerged economies by now. They have some of the world’s highest
            
growth rates.
            
That’s why, in our quest for economic growth, we in the EU should focus our attention and
            
energies to engage their growth, creating opportunities for ourselves as well.
            
But there is more to the BRICS than just spectacular growth. These countries are
            
increasing their political cooperation, for instance in the UN Security Council and in the
            
G20, or in the climate debate.
            
Certainly, the European Union has good, cooperative relations with all the BRICS
            
countries: each of them is a ""strategic partner"" of the EU. Yet we should find a way to
            
better engage these countries: from development strategies to climate change, from the
            
challenges of access to resources and raw materials to certain political issues of global
            
significance, we have numerous topics that could be discussed together.
            
To create new jobs, we must also improve the EU's trade performance and attract more
            
foreign investment. This implies a qualitative deepening of our economic and trade
            
relations with partners whose markets are expanding at a significant pace, such as China
            
and the emerging economies. Only the recently concluded Free Trade Agreement with
            
South Korea will generate 1.6 billion euro in customs duties per year. Once fully
            
implemented, it will lead to new trade opportunities of nearly 20 billion euro of additional
            
EU goods and services exports. Negotiations of Free Trade Agreements with India,
            
Mercosur and the Ukraine are pending.
            
Last but not least, the accession of Russia to the World Trade Organisation is one of the
            
most strategic issues for Europe. Opening up its economy, having to comply with
            
international economic law and with international economic cooperation will strengthen
            
the forces of modernisation in the country. Besides the finalisation of the bilateral
            
negotiations with Russia, the EU actively supported the Swiss-led mediation efforts
            
leading to the agreement between Georgia and Russia - one of the most difficult hurdles
            
for the Russian WTO-Accession.
            
Trend 2: power and influence in the world are more and more a matter of economy, and
            
less of weapons.
            
The experiences of both Iraq and Afghanistan have clearly demonstrated that long-term
            
stability cannot be achieved exclusively by military intervention but only through a long
            
term and comprehensive commitment. This is a lesson learned that we should all keep in
            
mind, by the way, against the background of our success so far in Libya – an intervention
            
justified on humanitarian grounds and carried out in accordance with international law.
            
Hopefully, emerging powers are also learning the lesson that they cannot rely on their
            
growing military muscle without the risk of isolating themselves.
            
In short: power no longer only comes ""from the barrel of a gun"". Stalin's question: ""The
            
Vatican: How many divisions?"" is no longer the central question.

Trend 3 - The strategic shift from the Atlantic to the Pacific
            
The twentieth century was an Atlantic century, while the twenty-first is going to be a
            
Pacific one. It is a cliché, but like in every cliché, there is a truth in it. The tendencies go
            
further than the well-known growth dynamics and demographics. Asia and the Pacific are
            
quickly emerging scientific and research powerhouses, and the region’s competitiveness is
            
the global standard.
            
Let me mention one Pacific-related issue, Europe’s relationship with the United States. Our
            
fundamental values of democracy, human rights and a rule-bound international order
            
remain common. Europeans and Americans are and were only recently peacekeeping,
            
fighting and working shoulder to shoulder in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Libya. Yet
            
with the disappearance of the common threat posed by the Soviet Union, Europe and the
            
U.S. no longer automatically share the same hopes and fears, an encompassing political
            
outlook. In a Pacific world, the concept of “the West” looses the cohesive force it had. But
            
there is still a ""West"" although there is no ""East"" any more.
            
On Iran, the new report of the International Atomic Energy Agency increases our concerns
            
over the nuclear programme and the lack of progress in diplomatic efforts. We will
            
continue to examine possible new as well as reinforced restrictive measures.
            
Ladies and Gentlemen,
            
In the European Union we are well aware that our credibility as a global player ultimately
            
will be judged by how we handle the neighbourhood.
            
This is true for the our Eastern Neighbourhood and for the Balkans. The European
            
perspective offered to the latter region has contributed decisively to stability and
            
prosperity. Even if we have not yet reached ultimate goals, the Western Balkans have a
            
European vocation.
            
This is true for the Arab Spring. The European Union is doing its utmost to push the events
            
in (what we consider to be) the right direction, helping those forces that work towards
            
democracy and economic reform benefitting the people, but we frankly do not determine
            
the end result - and we should not want to.

Meine Damen und Herren,
            
am Ende dieser Reise durch den Arbeitskalender des Europäischen Rates ist meine
            
Ankündigung wohl wahr geworden: Dies ist politisch nicht die Zeit für lockere 'Festreden'
            
über Europa, es ist nicht die Zeit für 'leichte Kost'.
            
Aber als Gast des Landes von ""Äbbelwoi, Handkees, Worscht und Weckewerk"" hoffe ich,
            
dass die von mir servierte Vorspeise nicht zu schwer war.
            
In diesem Sinne wünsche ich Ihnen jetzt allen einen guten Appetit!

Au commencement, nous étions six nations de l'Europe occidentale.              Aujourd'hui, nous sommes une Union de 27 pays membres, s'étalant sur tout le continent,              avec 500 millions d'habitants et des partenaires dans le monde entier.

Par contre, je suis le premier dans ce              rôle à ne plus être en même temps le Chef d’Etat ou de Gouvernement de son pays, le              premier à travailler à plein-temps à rassembler les 27. Cette innovation institutionnelle              donne à notre Union une plus grande continuité et cohérence, également vis-à-vis des              dirigeants du reste du monde. Je tiens donc à remercier l'Assemblée de reconnaître cette              innovation en me donnant la parole.              [EN]              Mr President,              In the one year since the previous General Assembly, the world has changed. And in some              ways, changed for the better.              I should like to speak, first of all, about our hope, secondly about some of our worries, and              thirdly about the responsibility the European Union assumes in this world of hope and              worries.              Firstly, there is hope              Hope for the millions of men and women who recently climbed out of poverty – in Asia, in              Latin America and fortunately more and more in Africa too. 'Emerging economies' become              'emerged societies'.              Hope for the newest member of this Assembly, the Republic of South Sudan, after its              transition to independence. Although concerns about the fighting remain, we applaud the              end to decades of civil war.              New hope, most of all, thanks to the will of the peoples in Northern Africa and the Middle              East to take the road of democracy. Even if the fighting is not over, we have seen the              defeat of repression, the defeat of terrorism, and the victory of forward-looking change.              For us, the Arab Spring is one of the most momentous political developments since the end              of the Cold War. We Europeans, so close to the Arab world by the bonds of history and              geography, we wish this Spring to blossom. That's why we support all steps towards              democratic transformation and economic reforms benefitting the people – with financial              resources, with access to our markets, with mobility among our countries, and with              assistance for state- and nation building.              Our aim is that the young men and women in our Southern Neighbourhood feel they can              build a future in their own country.              A hope for a better life.               EUCO 78/11               2               EN               We have done more. When, earlier this year, there was the risk of a bloodbath in Benghazi,              European leaders, together with others, acted with swiftness and determination,              diplomatically (here in New York) and militarily. We could not allow the Libyan regime to              take the lives of its own people. The principle of “responsibility to protect” was put into              action – with perseverance and success. Now there is a ""responsibility to assist"" the new              Libya with the political transition, the reconciliation and the reconstruction of a united              country. The Transitional National Council, today in the Libya seat, is ready for that task.              Europe was, is, and will remain on the side of the Libyans.              Mr President,              In my view the Arab Spring is telling two important lessons.              The first one. When ten years ago almost to the day, the horrific terrorist attacks of 9/11              were committed in this very city, many feared the start of an era of religious hatred. That              has not happened. The people in the streets of Tunis, Cairo, Benghazi and across the Arab              world aspired to dignity, jobs, equal opportunities, social justice and democracy. We              witnessed no extremism, not the so-called clash of civilisations, but an episode in the fight              for freedom and for justice. And these should remain the overriding objectives for the              future.              Second lesson: a political system which does not allow for peaceful change will remain              weak at heart. We praise, therefore, the leaders that are taking courageous steps towards              positive change.              But alongside the hope, there is reason for worry too. Worry about the brutal and on-going              repression by the Syrian regime against its own citizens. Europe is keeping the pressure on              the regime with sanctions, urging others to join us.              Of course, there are other worries too:              Worry about the famine in Somalia, where thousands of children have died and many more              are at risk -- and where we must act decisively;              Worry about on-going wars and conflicts;              About the safety of nuclear reactors;              About nuclear proliferation and the behaviour of the Iranian and North-Korean leadership;              And worry about climate change.              In each case, we have to ask ourselves, as international community: Are we doing what we              should be doing? Both in the short term: protecting human lives, and in the longer term:              preserving life for mankind.               EUCO 78/11               3               EN               Mr President,              Faced with these realities of hope and worry in the world, the European Union takes up its              responsibility. We act. Supporting the forces of hope. Fighting the causes of worry. And              very concretely so.              With means and money. The European Union is the world’s largest donor of development              aid and a major donor of climate finance for the poorest nations.              With manpower. We have not only tens of thousands of development workers, but also              thousands of soldiers, policemen and judges in missions around the world: peacekeeping in              Africa’s Great Lake region, training police in Afghanistan and Iraq, patrolling off the coast              of Somalia.              With a sense of the global common good. In the issues of global governance, Europe looks              for solutions. We are constructive in world trade negotiations, ambitious in climate talks,              and forthcoming in the reform of the international financial institutions, recognizing the              shift in global economic power. We simply cannot accept a stalemate, be it in Durban,              Doha, Rio, or Cannes.              With expertise in mediation. We mediate in conflicts in our neighbourhood and beyond,              drawing from our experience of overcoming age-old rivalries. In the Balkans, we bring              parties together. And as a member of the Quartet, we are fully engaged in finding a              solution in the Middle East Peace Process.              A word on that issue. The parameters for a solution on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are              well-known. The EU has outlined these on numerous occasions, also here at the United              Nations: no reason to repeat them. Now is the time for politics: for dialogue and              negotiations. Populations have lived in fear and suffering for too long.              The principle of a two states solution was established more than 60 years ago. Only half of              it has been implemented. The EU's political position on the Middle East Peace Process is              well-established; it includes a reference to the 1967 borders with territorial swaps              acceptable to both parties. Moreover, the EU is fully supporting financially the statebuilding process by the Palestinian Authority.              Now, the resumption of direct talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority is the top              priority.              The legitimate aspirations of both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples for peace, safety and              statehood must be fulfilled, with an agreement that will lead to the existence of two states              living side by side in peace and security – and therefore including Israel's legitimate              security needs, and the Palestinians’ desire to end the occupation.              That’s why I say to the leaders on both sides: The time to act is now. There are political              risks, but you need to take them – just like some of your predecessors did – with a view of              offering a better and safer future to your communities. The status quo is no option. The              wind of change across the entire region should help you to get out of impasses.               EUCO 78/11               4               EN               And I say to them: History is a severe judge for short-sightedness. Over time, it only              rewards political courage and statesmanship. And from the European experience, we can              tell you: A lasting compromise is grounded on mutual sacrifice and trust.              Mr President,              In a few weeks, a woman somewhere will give birth to a child -- to the 7-billionth human              being on earth… The birth of a baby: the strongest sign of hope. But on what planet will              this child live?              As things stand, we cannot be certain to save the environment. Present patterns of              production and consumption are unsustainable. Moreover, our actions to combat climate              change are insufficient, below the politically agreed objectives.              Clearly more needs to be done to align words and deeds, starting in the Durban Conference              on climate. Europe sticks to its commitments. We are delivering on the emission targets.              And we invite the rest of the industrialised countries to join us.              At next year's 'Rio+20 Conference', the world should show its renewed commitment to              sustainable development. 'Green growth' must become the rallying cry; in countries big and              small, rich and poor. And as I said, Europe is ready to help the most vulnerable nations.              Mr President,              Europe takes its responsibility: in the world but also at home. The most serious test since              years we are now facing is the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone. European leaders are              taking the decisions, individually and jointly, to bring this storm to rest. We are acting with              determination and in a spirit of solidarity. It requires political courage and statesmanship.              The responsibility which I feel around the table of our 27 Presidents and Prime Ministers,              is not just related to the euro's weakest economies, nor to the Eurozone alone; no, we feel a              responsibility for the world economy as such.              Looking to the weeks and months ahead, you may be assured that we will continue to do              what it takes to safeguard the financial stability of the Eurozone, working on more              governance, fiscal discipline and fiscal integration. It is the defining challenge for my              generation.              We are aware that people in other economies look at us, since our problems may affect              their jobs, pensions or savings. We likewise expect the other major economies to take              responsibility for their internal challenges. Each has to bring its own house in order – be it              by bringing down its public debt, by stimulating domestic demand or by aligning exchange              rates to economic fundamentals.

Dans un monde qui              se mondialise chaque jour davantage, le rôle des Nations Unies est indispensable.              Les 500 millions d'Européens refusent le repli sur soi, le ‘splendid isolation’.              De plus, le monde n’appartient à aucune nation.

Mesdames et Messieurs les Chefs d'Etat et de Gouvernement,
            
Monsieur le Président de l'Assemblée générale,
            
Monsieur le Secrétaire-Général,
            
Excellences,
            
Mesdames et Messieurs,
            
L'Europe vous apporte un message de coopération, de soutien et de partenariat.
            
Je félicite le nouveau Président de l'Assemblée générale, l'Ambassadeur Al-Nasser du
            
Qatar. Nous partageons entièrement votre engagement pour la médiation comme chemin
            
privilégié de la résolution paisible de conflits.
            
Votre tout premier prédécesseur était Paul-Henri Spaak, un homme qui – dans les années
            
d'après-guerre – joua aussi un rôle décisif dans la genèse d'une nouvelle et unique
            
coopération parmi les Etats européens.
            
Au commencement, nous étions six nations de l'Europe occidentale.
            
Aujourd'hui, nous sommes une Union de 27 pays membres, s'étalant sur tout le continent,
            
avec 500 millions d'habitants et des partenaires dans le monde entier.

Je ne suis pas le premier Président du Conseil européen qui s'adresse à cette Assemblée
            
pour partager les expériences et la vision de l'Europe. Par contre, je suis le premier dans ce
            
rôle à ne plus être en même temps le Chef d’Etat ou de Gouvernement de son pays, le
            
premier à travailler à plein-temps à rassembler les 27. Cette innovation institutionnelle
            
donne à notre Union une plus grande continuité et cohérence, également vis-à-vis des
            
dirigeants du reste du monde. Je tiens donc à remercier l'Assemblée de reconnaître cette
            
innovation en me donnant la parole.

Mr President,
            
In the one year since the previous General Assembly, the world has changed. And in some
            
ways, changed for the better.
            
I should like to speak, first of all, about our hope, secondly about some of our worries, and
            
thirdly about the responsibility the European Union assumes in this world of hope and
            
worries.
            
Firstly, there is hope
            
Hope for the millions of men and women who recently climbed out of poverty – in Asia, in
            
Latin America and fortunately more and more in Africa too. 'Emerging economies' become
            
'emerged societies'.
            
Hope for the newest member of this Assembly, the Republic of South Sudan, after its
            
transition to independence. Although concerns about the fighting remain, we applaud the
            
end to decades of civil war.
            
New hope, most of all, thanks to the will of the peoples in Northern Africa and the Middle
            
East to take the road of democracy. Even if the fighting is not over, we have seen the
            
defeat of repression, the defeat of terrorism, and the victory of forward-looking change.
            
For us, the Arab Spring is one of the most momentous political developments since the end
            
of the Cold War. We Europeans, so close to the Arab world by the bonds of history and
            
geography, we wish this Spring to blossom. That's why we support all steps towards
            
democratic transformation and economic reforms benefitting the people – with financial
            
resources, with access to our markets, with mobility among our countries, and with
            
assistance for state- and nation building.
            
Our aim is that the young men and women in our Southern Neighbourhood feel they can
            
build a future in their own country.
            
A hope for a better life.

We have done more. When, earlier this year, there was the risk of a bloodbath in Benghazi,
            
European leaders, together with others, acted with swiftness and determination,
            
diplomatically (here in New York) and militarily. We could not allow the Libyan regime to
            
take the lives of its own people. The principle of “responsibility to protect” was put into
            
action – with perseverance and success. Now there is a ""responsibility to assist"" the new
            
Libya with the political transition, the reconciliation and the reconstruction of a united
            
country. The Transitional National Council, today in the Libya seat, is ready for that task.
            
Europe was, is, and will remain on the side of the Libyans.
            
Mr President,
            
In my view the Arab Spring is telling two important lessons.
            
The first one. When ten years ago almost to the day, the horrific terrorist attacks of 9/11
            
were committed in this very city, many feared the start of an era of religious hatred. That
            
has not happened. The people in the streets of Tunis, Cairo, Benghazi and across the Arab
            
world aspired to dignity, jobs, equal opportunities, social justice and democracy. We
            
witnessed no extremism, not the so-called clash of civilisations, but an episode in the fight
            
for freedom and for justice. And these should remain the overriding objectives for the
            
future.
            
Second lesson: a political system which does not allow for peaceful change will remain
            
weak at heart. We praise, therefore, the leaders that are taking courageous steps towards
            
positive change.
            
But alongside the hope, there is reason for worry too. Worry about the brutal and on-going
            
repression by the Syrian regime against its own citizens. Europe is keeping the pressure on
            
the regime with sanctions, urging others to join us.
            
Of course, there are other worries too:
            
Worry about the famine in Somalia, where thousands of children have died and many more
            
are at risk -- and where we must act decisively;
            
Worry about on-going wars and conflicts;
            
About the safety of nuclear reactors;
            
About nuclear proliferation and the behaviour of the Iranian and North-Korean leadership;
            
And worry about climate change.
            
In each case, we have to ask ourselves, as international community: Are we doing what we
            
should be doing? Both in the short term: protecting human lives, and in the longer term:
            
preserving life for mankind.

Mr President,
            
Faced with these realities of hope and worry in the world, the European Union takes up its
            
responsibility. We act. Supporting the forces of hope. Fighting the causes of worry. And
            
very concretely so.
            
With means and money. The European Union is the world’s largest donor of development
            
aid and a major donor of climate finance for the poorest nations.
            
With manpower. We have not only tens of thousands of development workers, but also
            
thousands of soldiers, policemen and judges in missions around the world: peacekeeping in
            
Africa’s Great Lake region, training police in Afghanistan and Iraq, patrolling off the coast
            
of Somalia.
            
With a sense of the global common good. In the issues of global governance, Europe looks
            
for solutions. We are constructive in world trade negotiations, ambitious in climate talks,
            
and forthcoming in the reform of the international financial institutions, recognizing the
            
shift in global economic power. We simply cannot accept a stalemate, be it in Durban,
            
Doha, Rio, or Cannes.
            
With expertise in mediation. We mediate in conflicts in our neighbourhood and beyond,
            
drawing from our experience of overcoming age-old rivalries. In the Balkans, we bring
            
parties together. And as a member of the Quartet, we are fully engaged in finding a
            
solution in the Middle East Peace Process.
            
A word on that issue. The parameters for a solution on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are
            
well-known. The EU has outlined these on numerous occasions, also here at the United
            
Nations: no reason to repeat them. Now is the time for politics: for dialogue and
            
negotiations. Populations have lived in fear and suffering for too long.
            
The principle of a two states solution was established more than 60 years ago. Only half of
            
it has been implemented. The EU's political position on the Middle East Peace Process is
            
well-established; it includes a reference to the 1967 borders with territorial swaps
            
acceptable to both parties. Moreover, the EU is fully supporting financially the statebuilding process by the Palestinian Authority.
            
Now, the resumption of direct talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority is the top
            
priority.
            
The legitimate aspirations of both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples for peace, safety and
            
statehood must be fulfilled, with an agreement that will lead to the existence of two states
            
living side by side in peace and security – and therefore including Israel's legitimate
            
security needs, and the Palestinians’ desire to end the occupation.
            
That’s why I say to the leaders on both sides: The time to act is now. There are political
            
risks, but you need to take them – just like some of your predecessors did – with a view of
            
offering a better and safer future to your communities. The status quo is no option. The
            
wind of change across the entire region should help you to get out of impasses.

And I say to them: History is a severe judge for short-sightedness. Over time, it only
            
rewards political courage and statesmanship. And from the European experience, we can
            
tell you: A lasting compromise is grounded on mutual sacrifice and trust.
            
Mr President,
            
In a few weeks, a woman somewhere will give birth to a child -- to the 7-billionth human
            
being on earth… The birth of a baby: the strongest sign of hope. But on what planet will
            
this child live?
            
As things stand, we cannot be certain to save the environment. Present patterns of
            
production and consumption are unsustainable. Moreover, our actions to combat climate
            
change are insufficient, below the politically agreed objectives.
            
Clearly more needs to be done to align words and deeds, starting in the Durban Conference
            
on climate. Europe sticks to its commitments. We are delivering on the emission targets.
            
And we invite the rest of the industrialised countries to join us.
            
At next year's 'Rio+20 Conference', the world should show its renewed commitment to
            
sustainable development. 'Green growth' must become the rallying cry; in countries big and
            
small, rich and poor. And as I said, Europe is ready to help the most vulnerable nations.
            
Mr President,
            
Europe takes its responsibility: in the world but also at home. The most serious test since
            
years we are now facing is the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone. European leaders are
            
taking the decisions, individually and jointly, to bring this storm to rest. We are acting with
            
determination and in a spirit of solidarity. It requires political courage and statesmanship.
            
The responsibility which I feel around the table of our 27 Presidents and Prime Ministers,
            
is not just related to the euro's weakest economies, nor to the Eurozone alone; no, we feel a
            
responsibility for the world economy as such.
            
Looking to the weeks and months ahead, you may be assured that we will continue to do
            
what it takes to safeguard the financial stability of the Eurozone, working on more
            
governance, fiscal discipline and fiscal integration. It is the defining challenge for my
            
generation.
            
We are aware that people in other economies look at us, since our problems may affect
            
their jobs, pensions or savings. We likewise expect the other major economies to take
            
responsibility for their internal challenges. Each has to bring its own house in order – be it
            
by bringing down its public debt, by stimulating domestic demand or by aligning exchange
            
rates to economic fundamentals.

Monsieur le Président,
            
Evidemment notre agenda est beaucoup plus large.
            
Vous pouvez être rassuré que l'Europe restera engagée auprès de vous afin de construire un
            
monde de paix et de sécurité, de promouvoir les valeurs universelles des Droits de
            
l'Homme et de la démocratie, et de combattre la famine et la pauvreté. Dans un monde qui
            
se mondialise chaque jour davantage, le rôle des Nations Unies est indispensable.
            
Les 500 millions d'Européens refusent le repli sur soi, le ‘splendid isolation’.
            
De plus, le monde n’appartient à aucune nation.
            
Ce monde est notre monde, à nous tous.
            
Thank you, Mr President.

We need to work together on the position of Europe in the world. Without economic dynamism without joint actions, we will not be able to defend our interests and beliefs. Hopefully other global political players also will learn from them, they will learn that without cooperation and partnerships with the EU, they will pass the point. I am convinced that others will realize gradually. Our Union has a lot of opportunities and strengths. Europe offers a socioeconomic model of remarkable quality. We defend our interests in the world, but without losing sight of global public interest. I think above all the poorest and most vulnerable countries. Obviously, there must be normal competitive conditions ( ""level playing field"") for our companies. We must not be naive. However, we all know we need something more in politics, as in life, and that Europe can bring. Do not forget that the fall of communism twenty years ago now, was a direct consequence of the attractiveness of our lifestyle, our ""European Way of Life"". This is why, if we are strong economically and ecologically, we will be even more generous and more open vis-à-vis others. That is why we must remain ambitious in Europe. This is not to make any Europe. We do not want a Europe populist or nationalist. We want neither of unbridled market nor a passive welfare state and stifling any momentum. The greatest danger that threatens us is abandoning solidarity by selfishness, is the abdication of political courage with ease. That's why all European institutions-have to work together.

""LEÇONS A TIRER DE LA CRISE""
            
We are facing difficult times. It is essential to have the correct analysis of the situation and to draw the
            
right lessons from it.
            
The European Union has survived the financial crisis and its economic consequences. Why? Because
            
we have drawn the lessons of the Great Crisis of the 1930's.
            
This time, we avoided protectionism. We avoided budgetary deflation. We avoided competitive
            
devaluation. We avoided nationalism.
            
Instead of these, we live in an internal free market. We have monetary stability. We have successful
            
re-launch policies. And we have a start of global economic governance.
            
What's more, we have also drawn the right lessons from the weak regulation of the financial sector,
            
with its unhampered gluttony.
            
We have experienced that national oversight bodies cannot adequately control multinational banks.
            
We have experienced, to our detriment, that with the choice between return on investment versus risk,
            
excessive risk taking won the battle.
            
It is my conviction that we should also draw lessons from the crisis for the eurozone. We need a much
            
stronger economic coordination, an ""economic government"", as some call it. Monetary unity is
            
impossible without moving toward an economic Union. It is as simple as that.
            
The Lisbon Treaty allows us to monitor more closely the differences in competitiveness and budgetary
            
discipline. Without that, we will not be able to collectively reap the benefits of our economic strategy
            
and economic growth. In this regard, we find ourselves at the beginning of a few decisive weeks.

Nous devons également tirer les leçons de la Conférence de Copenhague sur le climat. Il nous faut
            
travailler, ensemble, sur la position de l'Europe dans le monde. Sans un dynamisme économique, sans
            
des actions communes, nous ne serons pas en état de défendre nos intérêts et nos convictions.
            
J'espère que les autres acteurs politiques mondiaux tireront eux aussi des leçons, qu'ils apprendront
            
que sans une coopération et des partenariats avec l'Union, ils ne pourront point réussir. Je suis
            
convaincu que les autres en prendront conscience progressivement.
            
Notre Union dispose d'un grand nombre de possibilités et d'atouts. L'Europe offre un modèle socioéconomique d'une qualité remarquable. Nous défendons nos propres intérêts dans le monde, mais sans
            
perdre de vue un intérêt général mondial. Je pense avant tout aux pays les plus pauvres et les plus
            
vulnérables.
            
Evidemment, il doit y avoir des conditions concurrentielles normales (""level playing field"") pour nos
            
entreprises. Il ne faut pas être naïf. Cependant, nous savons tous qu'il faut quelque chose de plus dans
            
la politique, comme dans la vie, et que c'est l'Europe qui peut l'apporter. N'oublions pas que la chute
            
du communisme, il y a vingt ans désormais, était une conséquence directe de l'attractivité de notre
            
mode de vie, de notre ""European way of life"". C'est pour cela que, si nous sommes forts sur le plan
            
économique et écologique, nous pourrons être d'autant plus généreux et d'autant plus ouverts vis-à-vis
            
des autres.
            
Voilà les raisons pour lesquelles nous devons rester ambitieux en Europe. Ce n'est pas pour faire
            
n'importe quelle Europe. Nous ne voulons pas d'une Europe populiste, ou nationaliste. Nous ne
            
voulons ni d'un marché effréné, ni d'un Etat-providence passif et étouffant tout dynamisme. Le plus
            
grand danger qui nous menace, c'est l'abandon de la solidarité par égoïsme, c'est l'abdication du
            
courage politique par facilité.
            
That's why all European institutions have to work together. They were, without exception, all given
            
more possibilities under the Treaty of Lisbon. New institutions and offices can bring new solutions.
            
It all depends on the people that embody them. An institution is a means, not a goal in itself.
            
In four-and-a-half years, the citizens will ask us what we have done for them. What will be our
            
testimony. Four-and-a-half years, that is, politically speaking, the day after tomorrow…What will we
            
be able to tell them? That is the deep question which should motivate us every single day.
            
If we find the right answer to that questions, generations after us will be able to draw lessons from
            
what we did.

Nichts geht über einen solchen kurzen              Augenblick der Ruhe zwischen politischen Stürmen, um aktuelle Fragen zu erörtern und              den Weg in die Zukunft abzustecken. Während meiner fünfunddreißig Jahre als Politiker              habe ich oft solche Augenblicke gesucht.              Ein Augenblick der Klausur, ob allein oder mit anderen, gestattet es einem, einen Ankerplatz zu finden – allerdings nicht, um sich dort zur Ruhe zu legen, sondern um              anschließend mit größerer Zuversicht weiterzusegeln. Es ist mir daher ein großes              Vergnügen, heute hier bei der CSU zu sein: ich bin sehr geehrt, Ihr Gast sein zu dürfen!

As you all know, we are not only at the              beginning of a new year, or even a new decade. We are also, with our European Union, at              the beginning of a new adventure. Since December 1st, after almost a decade of debate and              negotiations, we finally have the new Treaty of Lisbon in place. Is it a totally new ship              capable of sailing the global storms, or is it just the old rusty model with some new paint?              Some people have very high expectations about the Lisbon Treaty, others think that              nothing important will change. I do not share either view. Let me just present some              preliminary reflections, steering a middle course between the cliff of exaggeration and the              rock of cynicism.              I speak in a peculiar capacity. My new role makes me one of the persons who embody the              European institutional renewal... Nevertheless I will try to keep a cool distance.              So please do not think of me every time I mention “the President of the European              Council”! The function counts more than the man. In my former capacity as prime              minister, I used to say that I have an important function but I consider myself as not so              important. It is not even false modesty.              There are three issues I would like to address today.              First, following what I just said, Europe’s institutional renewal.              Second and third, the two biggest challenges of the moment: the state of the economy, and              global climate politics after Copenhagen.              II.              Now, first on the new institutions.              I have to start with a small confession. Some people could be surprised that today, I chose              a party meeting for a speech after my official entry into function. Should I not, as president              of the European Council, be above parties? Should I not, so they could continue, try to step              out of the political arena with all the fights between left and right, liberal and conservative?              Yes and no.              Delivering a speech on a party gathering doesn’t make you a party man!              The president of the European Council is “elected” by the European Council, by a              qualified majority of the 27 heads of state and government. But he does not formally              depend on a parliamentary majority in the European Parliament. That is a difference with              the President of the European Commission, who is “proposed” by the European Council as              well, but who subsequently is “elected” by a majority of Parliament and is accountable to              it. The Commission President has, so to say, two masters to serve. The President of the              European Council has only one, the heads of state and government collectively. Therefore              he cannot be a party man.              Nevertheless I assist full-heartedly at this meeting of a political group of a national              parliament. The reason lies elsewhere. It is my deep conviction that the European Union              needs thriving national democracies.              All our member-states are representative democracies (not by accident, but as a rule!).              Political parties play an essential role. Parties transform ideas into action, they link the              people to parliaments and governments, they embody a political past and recruit talents for              the future. Europe cannot live without them. Because the Union cannot live without              democracy.               2               Surely, in order to honour this crucial institution, and stay in touch with it, I also could              have gone to a meeting of the Parti Socialiste in France, or to the Civic Platform in              Poland... But they were just slower to invite me than you!              Seriously, the point needs to be stressed because it is sometimes thought there is a              contradiction between a European democracy, as expressed in the European Parliament,              and our national democracies, expressed in national parliaments such as the Bundestag.              That is a misrepresentation. The Union as a whole needs all the parliaments we have.              In fact, the Lisbon Treaty states this more clearly than it has ever been said before. Let me              quote the first two paragraphs of the brand new Article 10.              (article 10 Lisbon Treaty)              1. The functioning of the Union shall be founded on representative democracy.              2. Citizens are directly represented at Union level in the European Parliament.              Member States are represented in the European Council by their Heads of State or              Government and in the Council by their governments, themselves democratically              accountable either to their national Parliaments, or to their citizens.” [italics added]              The last sentence is crucial. The decisions of the European Council and the Council              ultimately rest upon the assent of Europe’s citizens in their capacity of national voters.              That is a unique strength.              I may add that the fourth and last paragraph of this article in the Lisbon Treaty reads:              4. Political parties at European level contribute to forming European political              awareness and to expressing the will of citizens of the Union.              So the Treaty acknowledges the vital role of the political party.              We do not have a better European democracy when decisions are reached more efficiently.              We have a better democracy when people in all the Member States feel their concerns have              been taken aboard, that they have been part of the decision.              This brings me to the European Council and its permanent Presidency.              Before we come to all the intricacies and the compromises of the new system, it may be              useful to remember why the European Council of Heads of state or government exists in              the first place.               3               The European Council was a relatively late invention. It dates from 1974. Originally the              European construction did not allow for heads of government summits, only for Council              meetings at minister level. To the founding fathers of Europe – men like Jean Monnet or              Paul-Henri Spaak – big summits were anathema. They smelled of the pre-Second World              War-era, when European politics were dominated by clashes of national interests without a              common goal, small countries being trampled by the big ones. Instead the founders hoped              that a neutral Commission could gradually become something resembling a European              government, upholding the rule of law against power play. In some Brussels circles, this              vision has had a long life (as the Members of European Parliament in our midst will no              doubt be able to confirm!).              Two elements changed the situation, one external and one internal. The first was the              French desire, starting with president De Gaulle, to have a European foreign policy. It was              all very well to have a Commission in Brussels he thought, but not for foreign policy              decisions. These were best left to the highest political authorities. De Gaulle was the first              to call occasional meetings of the heads of government of the Member States, in accord              with Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. One of his aims was to discuss global affairs with his              colleagues.              The second element concerns the internal decision making. In the late sixties and early              seventies, the Council of Ministers was often unable to reach a decision on Commission              proposals. The Six (and later Nine) national ministers got stuck around a table, because no              one was able to make a concession that would bind his government. The Community              ground to a halt. Some people felt that the blockades could be overcome by bringing the              heads of government into the European game. Once they assumed a common              responsibility, they could not duck. If they would not take a decision, nobody would.              These two elements came together in 1974. The need for Europe to act in the world was              felt more intensely. The Member States faced monetary instability after the break-up of              Bretton-Woods, a war in the Middle East and the first oil and energy crisis provoked by the              oil producing countries (it all sounds very familiar!). On the initiative of French president              Giscard d’Estaing, in full agreement with Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, the occasional              summits were turned into a permanent ‘institution’. The European Council was born. The              idea was to talk foreign policy and to give the Community an impetus. It was decided to              meet three times a year. It was also decided that the rotating president would represent the              Nine in foreign policy.              Interestingly, the original Giscard-Schmidt vision of a strong European executive was              watered down. Holland and Belgium in particular still feared a sidelining of the existing              Community structure by the Summits. They insisted that the European Council should              legally not be a European institution. (It is only now, 35 years later, that the European              Council becomes a full European institution, just five weeks ago!) To temper this risk, the              Community institutions were associated to the Summits. The President of the Commission              received a seat at the table; the rotating European Council President would present a report              to the Parliament after the meeting. These links between the Brussels world and the              Summits proved very useful. Within a decade, the Summits (as we keep calling them) had              grown into the informal centre of the big, strategic decisions in the Community.               4               I draw three conclusions from this origin.              One: the European Council of heads of state and government was always meant to              deal with both foreign affairs and internal decisions. Its raison d’être is the capacity to              link external events to a common policy.              Two: the European Council itself was the result of a legal and political compromise,              between those Member States who wanted a strong executive power, through              bringing together the heads of the national executives, and those who were against the              new institution as such and who would have preferred a stronger Commission.              Maybe this compromise was legally strange, but it did assume its political place in the              European construction.              Three: this compromise has, in fact, overcome the old distinction between the              intergovernmental and the supranational; it has resulted in a synthesis allowing the              Union to build both on the strength of the Member-States and the qualities of our              common institutions.              This history is instructive when looking at the current situation.              In the constitutional debate we had since 2000, the same elements and positions as three              decades ago are in play. Concentrating on the role of the heads of government in the EU,              this time it was not about regular Summits, as in the 1970’s, but about a permanent              President.              The same pressure of external events existed as in 1974, with this time the tragic events of              9/11.              The same need for stronger internal decision-making existed, especially after the              enlargements to 25 and 27 members.              And the final result, the Treaty text we now have, obviously was the result of the same              kind of political compromise we Europeans excel in. This time it was a compromise              between those Member States who wanted a strong, French-style presidential figure, and              those Member States who did not want a permanent president at all and preferred keeping              the rotating presidency at all levels and who feared a diminished role of the Commission.              Let us be frank: this is not the main point of the Lisbon Treaty.              We need not dwell too long on the legal peculiarities of the end result. We may safely              assume that a treaty which was born out of years of intense negotiating between all              Member States, even if not always legally logical, must contain some deep political truth.              A truth about the state of the European Union. The important question therefore is how the              system will work out politically.              Most importantly, the two extreme role models should be discarded: the permanent              President is not meant to be a Président, nor is he meant to be only a chairman.              Unfortunately these two images have dominated the discussion in the media.               5               On the one hand, he cannot be a Président as some kind of head of state in the full sense of              the word, because the relationship between the Member-States separately and their Union              as a whole does not bear it. Any European Council president, however talented, who would              go out on his own, speaking on behalf of Europe in Washington or Moscow without              having the assent of the heads of government, would soon speak, not for Europe, but only              for himself. That would harm the institution, and Europe as a whole.              On the other hand, he cannot just be a simple chairman either. The Treaty says that the              permanent President “shall, at his level and in that capacity, ensure the external              representation of the Union on issues concerning its common foreign and security policy”              (Art. 15§5). The words “at his level” point to the fact that, whereas the High              Representative for Foreign Affairs has important responsibilities in this area, the              permanent President is the person to receive and visit other Heads of state and government              in the name of the EU. It seems that this task rules out the role of a chairman only giving              people the floor.              That is not all, however. The potential strength of the permanent Presidency lies elsewhere:              in the time it disposes of. Not just six months, but two-and-a-half or five years, therefore              either five or ten times longer. This duration is why the office was invented. Strip off the              debate about profile, you still have the new relationship to time. I do not have to tell you,              as parliamentarians, that time is a politician’s prime material. The Treaty acknowledges              this change. Except for the external representation, it identifies three main tasks for the              permanent Presidency. It does so very precisely. They are: preparing the work and              conducting debates (“he shall drive forward the work”), drawing up common conclusions              (“he shall endeavour to facilitate consensus”) and following up the work (“he shall ensure              the continuity”). The first two tasks correspond to those of the rotating presidencies, but              the third one adds the organisation of the work in the medium and long term. It will be              fundamental.              I will endeavour to put the continuity at the heart of the European Council’s action.              Using time intelligently might also mean, depending on the circumstances, to be patient, to              take time...              It will be no easy task. Notwithstanding all the talk of treaty simplification, the situation              has become rather complicated. New formal and informal coordination mechanisms will              have to be set up. Leaving aside the relations with the Commission and the Parliament but              just looking at the Presidency, the situation is already quite complex. We have (1) the              President of the European Council, (2) the Member State holding the six-month rotating              presidency, currently Spain, (3) the High Representative, as President of the Foreign              Affairs Council, and (4) the President of the Eurogroup. That is a lot of heads for one              body!               6               A final point, of particular interest to at least some of you. The Treaty does not say much              about the relationship between the President and the European Parliament. There is just              one phrase: “he shall present a report to the European Parliament after each of the meetings              of the European Council.” (Just as the rotating Presidency always did.) I will take this              disposition seriously, also in what it does not say. A more intense dialogue between the              two institutions is conceivable, but within the framework of the Treaty. As said, and unlike              the Commission and its President, the European Council president is not accountable to the              Parliament. It would be a “confusion de genres” to do as if he were, for instance by starting              a monthly question time. There is in my view also a more general line of behaviour              involved. We have so few rules, that I will take care to interpret correctly those we              have.              How all this will work out in practice is largely an open field.              We will be treading upon uncharted territory, an undiscovered country.              No Treaty can define all paths in advance, fix all future misunderstandings. But I am a man              of consensus. I will work together with all EU-institutions, in full respect of each others'              competences. Good personal relations between the main actors is essential for success. Not              a personal success but that of the Union. This is not the time for rivalries between              institutions and their leaders. The Europeans want results, not a war of institutions.              Any “living constitution” is full of habits, conventions, unwritten rules.              Only time and experience will bring these about.              The aim is not to achieve some victory.              The aim is not to score points.              The aim is to discover how our European Union may fare better, and to come home              safely...              III.              This brings me to the second half of my intervention.              After form, the substance.              After the means, the goal.              I will make some remarks on the economy first, then a few words on ‘Copenhagen’.              Looking back to the economic crisis, first, it is important not to indulge in gloom.              As Europeans, we may be proud of what we achieved.              The worst has been avoided.              The errors of the crises of the 1930’s were not repeated.              We did not devalue the national currencies, as happened then. It was a-beggar-myneighbour-policy with disastrous effects.              We did not set for a deflationary budgetary policy, as was decided then.              We did not allow an immense number of banks to go bankrupt, as happened then.              Nor did we witness a return to national protectionism. Admittedly, there were some              incidents, but their importance has been exaggerated.              Moreover, the euro proved a safe harbour. Without the common currency, we would have              had more than one “Iceland” within the EU.              To our greatest benefit, the European Central Bank has confirmed its standing as the              world’s wisest central bank.               7               The insufficiencies in financial oversight and banking regulation were addressed              immediately and seriously. Together, the European members of the G20 played a very              constructive role in this regard. The G20 might develop into a forum of global governance.              As a result of all this, the worst of the crisis is already over. What a difference with the              crisis of the 1930’s, which ended only with the Second World War! Instead, we are back to              a scenario of modest economic growth within a year. This is a major achievement.               But where are we now?              Of course the troubles are not over.              The measures adopted during the crisis proved to be excellent short-term palliatives.              What we need now is reforms delivering long-term benefits.              There is a discussion about the moment on which a common “exit strategy” should start.              Indeed, but we are already are in the midst of an exit strategy! The Stability and Growth              Pact is the exit-strategy!              Member States who promised to be back at a budgetary deficit of maximum 3 percent in              2012, for instance, cannot wait until 2011 before they start taking measures. The same for              those who delayed until 2013, they must start well before 2012.              On the medium and long term, the European Union will have to develop a credible strategy              for growth for the next decade and beyond.              Since 2000, the EU has worked with the Lisbon process. This has yielded some results, but              not as much as was hoped for and not as much as we need. The instruments of the Lisbon              process are rather soft. “Peer review” and “benchmarking” are useful to collect and              compare date, but they do not on their own create political commitment. Therefore we              must find ways to enhance such shared commitment. This is especially true for the              member-states who share the euro. Although every national government has its own              responsibility for economic and social policy, the situation in one member-state affects all              the others... Invisibly, our states are all tied together. We politicians do not often say it              aloud to the public, but we all know it!              Stronger governance alone does not bring about a stronger economic performance for              Europe.              The long-term outlook is not bright. The OECD predicts an average structural growth rate              of less than 1 pct. GDP / year, for the EU as a whole. That is not enough. It is much less              than the Chinese (who are already back at 6 percent growth) and the Americans. We will              have to achieve an annual growth of at least 2 pct. if we want to keep up with the rest of              the world, and with our self-image.              This crisis has a potential negative impact on longer-term growth prospects. The worsened              financing conditions and higher risk aversion may indeed depress investment on a              permanent basis. Should the current rise in unemployment become in part structural, that              would have a lasting impact on the quantity and quality of labour. Human capital and              productivity are threatened by the risk of cuts in expenditure on education and on R&D              under depressed economic and budgetary conditions.               8               We have to find a way to raise our growth potential. I think there are two crucial ways of              achieving this. One is to move from a productivity driven towards an innovation driven              economy. Innovation is a key to maintain competitiveness, which is a priority in a heavily              export-oriented economy. We need more innovation through more creation, better transfer              and effective application of R&D. There is abundant evidence of a positive relationship              between R&D expenditure and economic growth at a macro level. The European objective              is 3% of GDP. For a lot of countries: it’s a long way to go.              The other way to boost potential growth is by raising the quantity and quality of the labour              force, since growing shortages of manpower are a threatening factor. We need to invest in              education and life-long learning.              We will have to ask also ourselves two awkward but fundamental questions.              First: How do we keep a minimum of industrial activity in Western Europe? Germany is              the exception, but the Benelux countries, Italy and the UK are de-industrializing rapidly.              For sure, Schumpeter spoke of the “creative destruction” of capitalism. Simply put: every              closed factory ‘A’ would be replaced by a more innovative factory ‘B’. But Schumpeter              never told us how long we are supposed to wait in between destruction and creation... We              will have to keep a very sharp eye on what is happening with our industrial base, by what              the jobs that disappear are replaced, if at all.              The second question concerns our debt. We have avoided the worst during the crisis, but              by shifting the financial pain forward, into the future. Of course, a part of the deficit is due              to the trade cycle but a larger part is structural. That’s why the Stability and Growth Pact is              so important.              It is legitimate that the rules of the Pact were temporarily loosened. The authors of the              criteria in the Maastricht Treaty could not have foreseen this crisis back in 1991.              Moreover, all member-states have pledged to be back within the maximum deficit of 3 pct.              GDP in 2013 at the latest.              Fiscal consolidation is necessary to keep confidence of consumers and investors, to keep              long-term interest rates low and the euro stable.              Are we in a position to succeed? Yes, of course! Crises can be a source of positive change,              when resources are reallocated towards their most productive uses. A new EU-strategy can              be crucial in this change. The member states and the regions have to be involved in this              collective effort.              In order to face these challenges together, the European Council will meet three times this              semester. Firstly, I have convened an extra, informal European Council on February 11th,              in five weeks time. There we will have a first exchange of views on a European strategy              for growth for 2020. Secondly, we will have the regular European Council on 25-26              March; it will mostly be dedicated, as every Spring European Council since the start of the              Lisbon process, to the economy. Thirdly, in the June European Council (on 17-18 June),              we will adopt the final text of our strategy for growth for the next decade.              I will make sure to use the continuity of my mandate for a serious follow-up. We need to              go beyond conclusions on paper to real-life commitments!               9               IV.              Let me finish with a few words on the Copenhagen Summit of last December on the global              fight against climate change.              The Summit itself leaves one with an uncomfortable impression, both as regards the              communication in the media and as regards substance. But it is important to nuance.              Of course there is a distance between the Copenhagen result, and the ambitious goals of              the European Union and the expectations of a large part of the public in the Western world.              But let us not forget that, contrary to what happened during earlier climate conferences, we              now have an agreement in which countries responsible for 80 pct. of pollution are              involved. That is a big step forward.              A lot will depend on the further implementation in 2010. In November of this year, a new              Conference is foreseen in Mexico-City. And before that, there is a meeting in Bonn in              June. It was scheduled as a regular expert meeting, but Chancellor Angela Merkel has              kindly offered to upgrade ‘Bonn’ to ministerial level in order to keep the political              momentum. This shows that our member-states are fully committed to continue to take              initiatives in this process, and of course I warmly welcome Frau Merkel’s gesture. Europe              can still be the leader!              Within a few weeks, we will know the quantitative goals of CO2-reduction. Then we will              know exactly how big the distance is between the pledges that have been made in              Copenhagen and what we still need to reach the aim of a maximum temperature rise of              2°C.              Copenhagen is a further step in a long process. As with so many reforms, we must work              step by step. Also, we must not forget fact that climate goals do not exist just in order to              satisfy international norms, but above all in order to reduce pollution in our own countries              and regions. What’s more, companies and citizens do not wait for norms to comply to, they              themselves take initiatives, companies introduce new technologies, citizens change their              consumption behaviour. And fortunately so! This means that the climate does not have to              wait for climate conferences only... They become uneasy exercises when everybody’s              focus is on a power play between continents and countries. Instead, we need to rebuild an              atmosphere of trust, a sense of a common goal.              In order to avoid risks and surprises, this should be a key priority in the preparation of the              next climate conference.              Therefore I have decided to add a reflection on ‘post-Copenhagen’ to the agenda of the              informal European Council of February. It is only by bringing all the member-states              together in a common strategy that we may hope to translate the EU’s ambitious climate              goals in global negotiating power. That is why I consider the climate, together with the              economy, to be the theme for 2010.               10               V.              Of course there will be other themes at this year’s agenda.              Foreign policy will be one of them. The European Union is now better equipped to speak              with one voice in the world. The global distribution of power is changing rapidly. We              might have to redefine our relations with the other big players, the USA, China and Russia              above all. The Copenhagen Summit has reminded us of the importance of the emergent              countries, like India and Brazil. It has also taught us some other geopolitical lessons. These              developments invite us to ask ourselves: How can we best collaborate with the other              players? How do we define ""we""? How do we convince the other players of our points of              view, how do we induce them to take our interests into consideration?              Apart from these pressing questions, which we can more or less sketch in advance, there is              the other, unforeseeable aspect of politics. Anytime a foreign policy crisis may occur,              ""unexpected"" as they may appear to be...; I do not have to point out the risks.              On a different level, we have the ongoing enlargement process with the Western Balkans.              Just before the Christmas break, visa requirements were lifted for the citizens of Serbia,              Montenegro and Macedonia. Two Western Balkan states have the official status of              accession country, Macedonia and Croatia. As regards Croatia, once it fulfils all the              criteria, I hope we will be able to take some steps forward during this year 2010.               Liebe Freunde, kurzum: der Europäische Rat hat eine einzigartige Stellung unter den              europäischen Organen, die es ihm erlaubt, sich sowohl innen- wie außenpolitischen              Herausforderungen zu stellen. Deshalb ist er damals entstanden, so funktioniert er nun und              wird dies auch künftig tun. Gerade jetzt stehen wir im Innern vor einer doppelten              wirtschaftlichen wie ökologischen Krise, die all unsere Aufmerksamkeit und Kraft              verlangt. Im auswärtigen Bereich möchten wir unsere Sicht der Dinge mit unseren Partnern              überall auf der Welt besprechen und unsere Interessen verteidigen. Die Brüsseler Organe              allein können diese gewaltigen Herausforderungen nicht meistern. Die Europäische Union              kann nur funktionieren, wenn alle Mitgliedstaaten zusammenarbeiten und wenn in jedem              Mitgliedstaat alle Regionen und Kommunen sich an den Anstrengungen beteiligen. Das ist              meine Botschaft an Sie hier heute. Lassen Sie uns zusammenarbeiten!              Ich danke Ihnen für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit.               _______________________               11                            ",europea cou cil presid brussel januari pce speech presid european council

Speech by the President of the European Council,
            
Mr. Herman Van Rompuy pronounced today at the
            
""Klausurtagung” of the CSU-Landesgruppe
            
Wildbad Kreuth, Germany
            

Liebe Freunde,
            
Sie pflegen die sehr schöne Tradition, den Beginn des neuen Jahres dazu zu nutzen, in
            
Klausur zu gehen und gemeinsam nachzudenken. Nichts geht über einen solchen kurzen
            
Augenblick der Ruhe zwischen politischen Stürmen, um aktuelle Fragen zu erörtern und
            
den Weg in die Zukunft abzustecken. Während meiner fünfunddreißig Jahre als Politiker
            
habe ich oft solche Augenblicke gesucht.
            
Ein Augenblick der Klausur, ob allein oder mit anderen, gestattet es einem, einen Ankerplatz zu finden – allerdings nicht, um sich dort zur Ruhe zu legen, sondern um
            
anschließend mit größerer Zuversicht weiterzusegeln. Es ist mir daher ein großes
            
Vergnügen, heute hier bei der CSU zu sein: ich bin sehr geehrt, Ihr Gast sein zu dürfen!
            
Bitte gestatten Sie mir, meine Rede auf Englisch fortzusetzen.

1
            

On the kind invitation of Dr. Hans-Peter Friedrich, I would like to share a few words with
            
you on the particular moment Europe is in. As you all know, we are not only at the
            
beginning of a new year, or even a new decade. We are also, with our European Union, at
            
the beginning of a new adventure. Since December 1st, after almost a decade of debate and
            
negotiations, we finally have the new Treaty of Lisbon in place. Is it a totally new ship
            
capable of sailing the global storms, or is it just the old rusty model with some new paint?
            
Some people have very high expectations about the Lisbon Treaty, others think that
            
nothing important will change. I do not share either view. Let me just present some
            
preliminary reflections, steering a middle course between the cliff of exaggeration and the
            
rock of cynicism.
            
I speak in a peculiar capacity. My new role makes me one of the persons who embody the
            
European institutional renewal... Nevertheless I will try to keep a cool distance.
            
So please do not think of me every time I mention “the President of the European
            
Council”! The function counts more than the man. In my former capacity as prime
            
minister, I used to say that I have an important function but I consider myself as not so
            
important. It is not even false modesty.
            
There are three issues I would like to address today.
            
First, following what I just said, Europe’s institutional renewal.
            
Second and third, the two biggest challenges of the moment: the state of the economy, and
            
global climate politics after Copenhagen.
            
II.
            
Now, first on the new institutions.
            
I have to start with a small confession. Some people could be surprised that today, I chose
            
a party meeting for a speech after my official entry into function. Should I not, as president
            
of the European Council, be above parties? Should I not, so they could continue, try to step
            
out of the political arena with all the fights between left and right, liberal and conservative?
            
Yes and no.
            
Delivering a speech on a party gathering doesn’t make you a party man!
            
The president of the European Council is “elected” by the European Council, by a
            
qualified majority of the 27 heads of state and government. But he does not formally
            
depend on a parliamentary majority in the European Parliament. That is a difference with
            
the President of the European Commission, who is “proposed” by the European Council as
            
well, but who subsequently is “elected” by a majority of Parliament and is accountable to
            
it. The Commission President has, so to say, two masters to serve. The President of the
            
European Council has only one, the heads of state and government collectively. Therefore
            
he cannot be a party man.
            
Nevertheless I assist full-heartedly at this meeting of a political group of a national
            
parliament. The reason lies elsewhere. It is my deep conviction that the European Union
            
needs thriving national democracies.
            
All our member-states are representative democracies (not by accident, but as a rule!).
            
Political parties play an essential role. Parties transform ideas into action, they link the
            
people to parliaments and governments, they embody a political past and recruit talents for
            
the future. Europe cannot live without them. Because the Union cannot live without
            
democracy.
            

2
            

Surely, in order to honour this crucial institution, and stay in touch with it, I also could
            
have gone to a meeting of the Parti Socialiste in France, or to the Civic Platform in
            
Poland... But they were just slower to invite me than you!
            
Seriously, the point needs to be stressed because it is sometimes thought there is a
            
contradiction between a European democracy, as expressed in the European Parliament,
            
and our national democracies, expressed in national parliaments such as the Bundestag.
            
That is a misrepresentation. The Union as a whole needs all the parliaments we have.
            
In fact, the Lisbon Treaty states this more clearly than it has ever been said before. Let me
            
quote the first two paragraphs of the brand new Article 10.
            
(article 10 Lisbon Treaty)
            
1. The functioning of the Union shall be founded on representative democracy.
            
2. Citizens are directly represented at Union level in the European Parliament.
            
Member States are represented in the European Council by their Heads of State or
            
Government and in the Council by their governments, themselves democratically
            
accountable either to their national Parliaments, or to their citizens.” [italics added]
            
The last sentence is crucial. The decisions of the European Council and the Council
            
ultimately rest upon the assent of Europe’s citizens in their capacity of national voters.
            
That is a unique strength.
            
I may add that the fourth and last paragraph of this article in the Lisbon Treaty reads:
            
4. Political parties at European level contribute to forming European political
            
awareness and to expressing the will of citizens of the Union.
            
So the Treaty acknowledges the vital role of the political party.
            
We do not have a better European democracy when decisions are reached more efficiently.
            
We have a better democracy when people in all the Member States feel their concerns have
            
been taken aboard, that they have been part of the decision.
            
This brings me to the European Council and its permanent Presidency.
            
Before we come to all the intricacies and the compromises of the new system, it may be
            
useful to remember why the European Council of Heads of state or government exists in
            
the first place.
            

3
            

The European Council was a relatively late invention. It dates from 1974. Originally the
            
European construction did not allow for heads of government summits, only for Council
            
meetings at minister level. To the founding fathers of Europe – men like Jean Monnet or
            
Paul-Henri Spaak – big summits were anathema. They smelled of the pre-Second World
            
War-era, when European politics were dominated by clashes of national interests without a
            
common goal, small countries being trampled by the big ones. Instead the founders hoped
            
that a neutral Commission could gradually become something resembling a European
            
government, upholding the rule of law against power play. In some Brussels circles, this
            
vision has had a long life (as the Members of European Parliament in our midst will no
            
doubt be able to confirm!).
            
Two elements changed the situation, one external and one internal. The first was the
            
French desire, starting with president De Gaulle, to have a European foreign policy. It was
            
all very well to have a Commission in Brussels he thought, but not for foreign policy
            
decisions. These were best left to the highest political authorities. De Gaulle was the first
            
to call occasional meetings of the heads of government of the Member States, in accord
            
with Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. One of his aims was to discuss global affairs with his
            
colleagues.
            
The second element concerns the internal decision making. In the late sixties and early
            
seventies, the Council of Ministers was often unable to reach a decision on Commission
            
proposals. The Six (and later Nine) national ministers got stuck around a table, because no
            
one was able to make a concession that would bind his government. The Community
            
ground to a halt. Some people felt that the blockades could be overcome by bringing the
            
heads of government into the European game. Once they assumed a common
            
responsibility, they could not duck. If they would not take a decision, nobody would.
            
These two elements came together in 1974. The need for Europe to act in the world was
            
felt more intensely. The Member States faced monetary instability after the break-up of
            
Bretton-Woods, a war in the Middle East and the first oil and energy crisis provoked by the
            
oil producing countries (it all sounds very familiar!). On the initiative of French president
            
Giscard d’Estaing, in full agreement with Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, the occasional
            
summits were turned into a permanent ‘institution’. The European Council was born. The
            
idea was to talk foreign policy and to give the Community an impetus. It was decided to
            
meet three times a year. It was also decided that the rotating president would represent the
            
Nine in foreign policy.
            
Interestingly, the original Giscard-Schmidt vision of a strong European executive was
            
watered down. Holland and Belgium in particular still feared a sidelining of the existing
            
Community structure by the Summits. They insisted that the European Council should
            
legally not be a European institution. (It is only now, 35 years later, that the European
            
Council becomes a full European institution, just five weeks ago!) To temper this risk, the
            
Community institutions were associated to the Summits. The President of the Commission
            
received a seat at the table; the rotating European Council President would present a report
            
to the Parliament after the meeting. These links between the Brussels world and the
            
Summits proved very useful. Within a decade, the Summits (as we keep calling them) had
            
grown into the informal centre of the big, strategic decisions in the Community.
            

4
            

I draw three conclusions from this origin.
            
One: the European Council of heads of state and government was always meant to
            
deal with both foreign affairs and internal decisions. Its raison d’être is the capacity to
            
link external events to a common policy.
            
Two: the European Council itself was the result of a legal and political compromise,
            
between those Member States who wanted a strong executive power, through
            
bringing together the heads of the national executives, and those who were against the
            
new institution as such and who would have preferred a stronger Commission.
            
Maybe this compromise was legally strange, but it did assume its political place in the
            
European construction.
            
Three: this compromise has, in fact, overcome the old distinction between the
            
intergovernmental and the supranational; it has resulted in a synthesis allowing the
            
Union to build both on the strength of the Member-States and the qualities of our
            
common institutions.
            
This history is instructive when looking at the current situation.
            
In the constitutional debate we had since 2000, the same elements and positions as three
            
decades ago are in play. Concentrating on the role of the heads of government in the EU,
            
this time it was not about regular Summits, as in the 1970’s, but about a permanent
            
President.
            
The same pressure of external events existed as in 1974, with this time the tragic events of
            
9/11.
            
The same need for stronger internal decision-making existed, especially after the
            
enlargements to 25 and 27 members.
            
And the final result, the Treaty text we now have, obviously was the result of the same
            
kind of political compromise we Europeans excel in. This time it was a compromise
            
between those Member States who wanted a strong, French-style presidential figure, and
            
those Member States who did not want a permanent president at all and preferred keeping
            
the rotating presidency at all levels and who feared a diminished role of the Commission.
            
Let us be frank: this is not the main point of the Lisbon Treaty.
            
We need not dwell too long on the legal peculiarities of the end result. We may safely
            
assume that a treaty which was born out of years of intense negotiating between all
            
Member States, even if not always legally logical, must contain some deep political truth.
            
A truth about the state of the European Union. The important question therefore is how the
            
system will work out politically.
            
Most importantly, the two extreme role models should be discarded: the permanent
            
President is not meant to be a Président, nor is he meant to be only a chairman.
            
Unfortunately these two images have dominated the discussion in the media.
            

5
            

On the one hand, he cannot be a Président as some kind of head of state in the full sense of
            
the word, because the relationship between the Member-States separately and their Union
            
as a whole does not bear it. Any European Council president, however talented, who would
            
go out on his own, speaking on behalf of Europe in Washington or Moscow without
            
having the assent of the heads of government, would soon speak, not for Europe, but only
            
for himself. That would harm the institution, and Europe as a whole.
            
On the other hand, he cannot just be a simple chairman either. The Treaty says that the
            
permanent President “shall, at his level and in that capacity, ensure the external
            
representation of the Union on issues concerning its common foreign and security policy”
            
(Art. 15§5). The words “at his level” point to the fact that, whereas the High
            
Representative for Foreign Affairs has important responsibilities in this area, the
            
permanent President is the person to receive and visit other Heads of state and government
            
in the name of the EU. It seems that this task rules out the role of a chairman only giving
            
people the floor.
            
That is not all, however. The potential strength of the permanent Presidency lies elsewhere:
            
in the time it disposes of. Not just six months, but two-and-a-half or five years, therefore
            
either five or ten times longer. This duration is why the office was invented. Strip off the
            
debate about profile, you still have the new relationship to time. I do not have to tell you,
            
as parliamentarians, that time is a politician’s prime material. The Treaty acknowledges
            
this change. Except for the external representation, it identifies three main tasks for the
            
permanent Presidency. It does so very precisely. They are: preparing the work and
            
conducting debates (“he shall drive forward the work”), drawing up common conclusions
            
(“he shall endeavour to facilitate consensus”) and following up the work (“he shall ensure
            
the continuity”). The first two tasks correspond to those of the rotating presidencies, but
            
the third one adds the organisation of the work in the medium and long term. It will be
            
fundamental.
            
I will endeavour to put the continuity at the heart of the European Council’s action.
            
Using time intelligently might also mean, depending on the circumstances, to be patient, to
            
take time...
            
It will be no easy task. Notwithstanding all the talk of treaty simplification, the situation
            
has become rather complicated. New formal and informal coordination mechanisms will
            
have to be set up. Leaving aside the relations with the Commission and the Parliament but
            
just looking at the Presidency, the situation is already quite complex. We have (1) the
            
President of the European Council, (2) the Member State holding the six-month rotating
            
presidency, currently Spain, (3) the High Representative, as President of the Foreign
            
Affairs Council, and (4) the President of the Eurogroup. That is a lot of heads for one
            
body!
            

6
            

A final point, of particular interest to at least some of you. The Treaty does not say much
            
about the relationship between the President and the European Parliament. There is just
            
one phrase: “he shall present a report to the European Parliament after each of the meetings
            
of the European Council.” (Just as the rotating Presidency always did.) I will take this
            
disposition seriously, also in what it does not say. A more intense dialogue between the
            
two institutions is conceivable, but within the framework of the Treaty. As said, and unlike
            
the Commission and its President, the European Council president is not accountable to the
            
Parliament. It would be a “confusion de genres” to do as if he were, for instance by starting
            
a monthly question time. There is in my view also a more general line of behaviour
            
involved. We have so few rules, that I will take care to interpret correctly those we
            
have.
            
How all this will work out in practice is largely an open field.
            
We will be treading upon uncharted territory, an undiscovered country.
            
No Treaty can define all paths in advance, fix all future misunderstandings. But I am a man
            
of consensus. I will work together with all EU-institutions, in full respect of each others'
            
competences. Good personal relations between the main actors is essential for success. Not
            
a personal success but that of the Union. This is not the time for rivalries between
            
institutions and their leaders. The Europeans want results, not a war of institutions.
            
Any “living constitution” is full of habits, conventions, unwritten rules.
            
Only time and experience will bring these about.
            
The aim is not to achieve some victory.
            
The aim is not to score points.
            
The aim is to discover how our European Union may fare better, and to come home
            
safely...
            
III.
            
This brings me to the second half of my intervention.
            
After form, the substance.
            
After the means, the goal.
            
I will make some remarks on the economy first, then a few words on ‘Copenhagen’.
            
Looking back to the economic crisis, first, it is important not to indulge in gloom.
            
As Europeans, we may be proud of what we achieved.
            
The worst has been avoided.
            
The errors of the crises of the 1930’s were not repeated.
            
We did not devalue the national currencies, as happened then. It was a-beggar-myneighbour-policy with disastrous effects.
            
We did not set for a deflationary budgetary policy, as was decided then.
            
We did not allow an immense number of banks to go bankrupt, as happened then.
            
Nor did we witness a return to national protectionism. Admittedly, there were some
            
incidents, but their importance has been exaggerated.
            
Moreover, the euro proved a safe harbour. Without the common currency, we would have
            
had more than one “Iceland” within the EU.
            
To our greatest benefit, the European Central Bank has confirmed its standing as the
            
world’s wisest central bank.
            

7
            

The insufficiencies in financial oversight and banking regulation were addressed
            
immediately and seriously. Together, the European members of the G20 played a very
            
constructive role in this regard. The G20 might develop into a forum of global governance.
            
As a result of all this, the worst of the crisis is already over. What a difference with the
            
crisis of the 1930’s, which ended only with the Second World War! Instead, we are back to
            
a scenario of modest economic growth within a year. This is a major achievement.
            

But where are we now?
            
Of course the troubles are not over.
            
The measures adopted during the crisis proved to be excellent short-term palliatives.
            
What we need now is reforms delivering long-term benefits.
            
There is a discussion about the moment on which a common “exit strategy” should start.
            
Indeed, but we are already are in the midst of an exit strategy! The Stability and Growth
            
Pact is the exit-strategy!
            
Member States who promised to be back at a budgetary deficit of maximum 3 percent in
            
2012, for instance, cannot wait until 2011 before they start taking measures. The same for
            
those who delayed until 2013, they must start well before 2012.
            
On the medium and long term, the European Union will have to develop a credible strategy
            
for growth for the next decade and beyond.
            
Since 2000, the EU has worked with the Lisbon process. This has yielded some results, but
            
not as much as was hoped for and not as much as we need. The instruments of the Lisbon
            
process are rather soft. “Peer review” and “benchmarking” are useful to collect and
            
compare date, but they do not on their own create political commitment. Therefore we
            
must find ways to enhance such shared commitment. This is especially true for the
            
member-states who share the euro. Although every national government has its own
            
responsibility for economic and social policy, the situation in one member-state affects all
            
the others... Invisibly, our states are all tied together. We politicians do not often say it
            
aloud to the public, but we all know it!
            
Stronger governance alone does not bring about a stronger economic performance for
            
Europe.
            
The long-term outlook is not bright. The OECD predicts an average structural growth rate
            
of less than 1 pct. GDP / year, for the EU as a whole. That is not enough. It is much less
            
than the Chinese (who are already back at 6 percent growth) and the Americans. We will
            
have to achieve an annual growth of at least 2 pct. if we want to keep up with the rest of
            
the world, and with our self-image.
            
This crisis has a potential negative impact on longer-term growth prospects. The worsened
            
financing conditions and higher risk aversion may indeed depress investment on a
            
permanent basis. Should the current rise in unemployment become in part structural, that
            
would have a lasting impact on the quantity and quality of labour. Human capital and
            
productivity are threatened by the risk of cuts in expenditure on education and on R&D
            
under depressed economic and budgetary conditions.
            

8
            

We have to find a way to raise our growth potential. I think there are two crucial ways of
            
achieving this. One is to move from a productivity driven towards an innovation driven
            
economy. Innovation is a key to maintain competitiveness, which is a priority in a heavily
            
export-oriented economy. We need more innovation through more creation, better transfer
            
and effective application of R&D. There is abundant evidence of a positive relationship
            
between R&D expenditure and economic growth at a macro level. The European objective
            
is 3% of GDP. For a lot of countries: it’s a long way to go.
            
The other way to boost potential growth is by raising the quantity and quality of the labour
            
force, since growing shortages of manpower are a threatening factor. We need to invest in
            
education and life-long learning.
            
We will have to ask also ourselves two awkward but fundamental questions.
            
First: How do we keep a minimum of industrial activity in Western Europe? Germany is
            
the exception, but the Benelux countries, Italy and the UK are de-industrializing rapidly.
            
For sure, Schumpeter spoke of the “creative destruction” of capitalism. Simply put: every
            
closed factory ‘A’ would be replaced by a more innovative factory ‘B’. But Schumpeter
            
never told us how long we are supposed to wait in between destruction and creation... We
            
will have to keep a very sharp eye on what is happening with our industrial base, by what
            
the jobs that disappear are replaced, if at all.
            
The second question concerns our debt. We have avoided the worst during the crisis, but
            
by shifting the financial pain forward, into the future. Of course, a part of the deficit is due
            
to the trade cycle but a larger part is structural. That’s why the Stability and Growth Pact is
            
so important.
            
It is legitimate that the rules of the Pact were temporarily loosened. The authors of the
            
criteria in the Maastricht Treaty could not have foreseen this crisis back in 1991.
            
Moreover, all member-states have pledged to be back within the maximum deficit of 3 pct.
            
GDP in 2013 at the latest.
            
Fiscal consolidation is necessary to keep confidence of consumers and investors, to keep
            
long-term interest rates low and the euro stable.
            
Are we in a position to succeed? Yes, of course! Crises can be a source of positive change,
            
when resources are reallocated towards their most productive uses. A new EU-strategy can
            
be crucial in this change. The member states and the regions have to be involved in this
            
collective effort.
            
In order to face these challenges together, the European Council will meet three times this
            
semester. Firstly, I have convened an extra, informal European Council on February 11th,
            
in five weeks time. There we will have a first exchange of views on a European strategy
            
for growth for 2020. Secondly, we will have the regular European Council on 25-26
            
March; it will mostly be dedicated, as every Spring European Council since the start of the
            
Lisbon process, to the economy. Thirdly, in the June European Council (on 17-18 June),
            
we will adopt the final text of our strategy for growth for the next decade.
            
I will make sure to use the continuity of my mandate for a serious follow-up. We need to
            
go beyond conclusions on paper to real-life commitments!

IV.
            
Let me finish with a few words on the Copenhagen Summit of last December on the global
            
fight against climate change.
            
The Summit itself leaves one with an uncomfortable impression, both as regards the
            
communication in the media and as regards substance. But it is important to nuance.
            
Of course there is a distance between the Copenhagen result, and the ambitious goals of
            
the European Union and the expectations of a large part of the public in the Western world.
            
But let us not forget that, contrary to what happened during earlier climate conferences, we
            
now have an agreement in which countries responsible for 80 pct. of pollution are
            
involved. That is a big step forward.
            
A lot will depend on the further implementation in 2010. In November of this year, a new
            
Conference is foreseen in Mexico-City. And before that, there is a meeting in Bonn in
            
June. It was scheduled as a regular expert meeting, but Chancellor Angela Merkel has
            
kindly offered to upgrade ‘Bonn’ to ministerial level in order to keep the political
            
momentum. This shows that our member-states are fully committed to continue to take
            
initiatives in this process, and of course I warmly welcome Frau Merkel’s gesture. Europe
            
can still be the leader!
            
Within a few weeks, we will know the quantitative goals of CO2-reduction. Then we will
            
know exactly how big the distance is between the pledges that have been made in
            
Copenhagen and what we still need to reach the aim of a maximum temperature rise of
            
2°C.
            
Copenhagen is a further step in a long process. As with so many reforms, we must work
            
step by step. Also, we must not forget fact that climate goals do not exist just in order to
            
satisfy international norms, but above all in order to reduce pollution in our own countries
            
and regions. What’s more, companies and citizens do not wait for norms to comply to, they
            
themselves take initiatives, companies introduce new technologies, citizens change their
            
consumption behaviour. And fortunately so! This means that the climate does not have to
            
wait for climate conferences only... They become uneasy exercises when everybody’s
            
focus is on a power play between continents and countries. Instead, we need to rebuild an
            
atmosphere of trust, a sense of a common goal.
            
In order to avoid risks and surprises, this should be a key priority in the preparation of the
            
next climate conference.
            
Therefore I have decided to add a reflection on ‘post-Copenhagen’ to the agenda of the
            
informal European Council of February. It is only by bringing all the member-states
            
together in a common strategy that we may hope to translate the EU’s ambitious climate
            
goals in global negotiating power. That is why I consider the climate, together with the
            
economy, to be the theme for 2010.

Of course there will be other themes at this year’s agenda.
            
Foreign policy will be one of them. The European Union is now better equipped to speak
            
with one voice in the world. The global distribution of power is changing rapidly. We
            
might have to redefine our relations with the other big players, the USA, China and Russia
            
above all. The Copenhagen Summit has reminded us of the importance of the emergent
            
countries, like India and Brazil. It has also taught us some other geopolitical lessons. These
            
developments invite us to ask ourselves: How can we best collaborate with the other
            
players? How do we define ""we""? How do we convince the other players of our points of
            
view, how do we induce them to take our interests into consideration?
            
Apart from these pressing questions, which we can more or less sketch in advance, there is
            
the other, unforeseeable aspect of politics. Anytime a foreign policy crisis may occur,
            
""unexpected"" as they may appear to be...; I do not have to point out the risks.
            
On a different level, we have the ongoing enlargement process with the Western Balkans.
            
Just before the Christmas break, visa requirements were lifted for the citizens of Serbia,
            
Montenegro and Macedonia. Two Western Balkan states have the official status of
            
accession country, Macedonia and Croatia. As regards Croatia, once it fulfils all the
            
criteria, I hope we will be able to take some steps forward during this year 2010.
            

Liebe Freunde, kurzum: der Europäische Rat hat eine einzigartige Stellung unter den
            
europäischen Organen, die es ihm erlaubt, sich sowohl innen- wie außenpolitischen
            
Herausforderungen zu stellen. Deshalb ist er damals entstanden, so funktioniert er nun und
            
wird dies auch künftig tun. Gerade jetzt stehen wir im Innern vor einer doppelten
            
wirtschaftlichen wie ökologischen Krise, die all unsere Aufmerksamkeit und Kraft
            
verlangt. Im auswärtigen Bereich möchten wir unsere Sicht der Dinge mit unseren Partnern
            
überall auf der Welt besprechen und unsere Interessen verteidigen. Die Brüsseler Organe
            
allein können diese gewaltigen Herausforderungen nicht meistern. Die Europäische Union
            
kann nur funktionieren, wenn alle Mitgliedstaaten zusammenarbeiten und wenn in jedem
            
Mitgliedstaat alle Regionen und Kommunen sich an den Anstrengungen beteiligen. Das ist
            
meine Botschaft an Sie hier heute. Lassen Sie uns zusammenarbeiten!
            
Ich danke Ihnen für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit.
