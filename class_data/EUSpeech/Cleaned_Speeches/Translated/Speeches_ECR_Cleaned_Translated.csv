Martin Callanan debate with President Hollande of France,05-02-2013,European Parliament,Martin Callanan,1933,"  Mr President, may I start by joining with the other group leaders and paying tribute to you and to your brave armed forces for the current operation in Mali. Your troops, aided by British and other Member States’ forces, are risking their lives to protect us, and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude. I think the Chamber is united on that point. Mr President, thank you for agreeing to hold a debate here in Strasbourg today. It is, of course, a beautiful and welcoming city, one that should perhaps be visited by everyone at least once, but maybe not once every month. You label yourself a pro-European, but if you truly were, then you would allow the Treaties to be changed so that this Parliament can finally decide where and when it sits. A large majority of Members in this Chamber, from all different nationalities, from all political groups – even including some French Members – are now in favour of this reform. I hope that you will support it, and I am sorry that none of the other group leaders had the courage to mention it. Mr President, I do not want to concentrate purely on Strasbourg today. Instead, I want to convey to you a simple message: thank you. Thank you for brilliantly demonstrating to the rest of Europe exactly what a socialist government looks like in practice – one that gets elected on to put an end to austerity and is then mugged by economic reality into introducing harsh budget cuts. I hope that the British Labour Party and all of the other socialist parties across Europe campaigning on similar themes are watching what actually happens in practice. When the socialists left power in my country, they left a note in the country’s Treasury. It said: ‘I am afraid there is no money left’. Last week your Labour Minister admitted that France is bankrupt. Let us be clear. Things are not in great shape in other countries either, but since you have come to power we have seen how devastating socialism can actually be, even to a country as well-placed and talented as France. When we look at the start of the crisis, it was socialist governments – in Spain, in Britain, in Portugal and in Greece – that maxed out the national credit cards, and it is conservative and centre-right parties that are helping to clear up the mess that they created. Mr President, you have shown us our socialist future. If we increase taxes to 75%, if we lower the retirement age to 60, and if we have a 35-hour working week, then of course that is electorally attractive. However, it is also devastating to our international competitiveness. Ronald Reagan used to have a great saying: ‘If it moves, tax it; if it keeps moving, regulate it; and, when it stops moving, subsidise it’. Reagan, of course, meant that as a joke, but sadly many of our socialists in this Chamber see it as some sort of manifesto. If Europe is to thrive then we need to take a new direction. For socialists – and you have said it again today – the single market means harmonised labour rules. It means, as you said, harmonised taxes and harmonised economic policies. For me, the single market means a free forum where we all compete with each other and, in turn, we then become more competitive in the international market. I raise this point because many in this House – and I think you hinted at it in your speech – keep suggesting that David Cameron was somehow asking for an unfair competitive advantage in his speech two weeks ago. That is simply not the case. He wants reform for all of Europe – a single marketplace where one country can have lower taxes, such as in Ireland, where other countries can have more flexible labour rules, such as in the UK, where some countries can have industry-friendly policies such as in Germany or the new Member States, and yet all still be integral members of the single market. It is time to make the EU about competition once again. After David Cameron’s speech, Mr President, your Foreign Minister said that this approach was like joining a football club and wanting to play rugby. Now, I like Mr Fabius; he has been right before. If you remember, he led the French ‘No’ campaign against the European Constitution. I think he is right again. In fact, I do not think he realised quite what a good analogy that actually was. This is because, of course, a football pitch is exactly where the game of rugby was first invented. No doubt the person who picked up that ball at the time and ran with it was derided, insulted and shouted at by his fellow players. But now, of course, we know that he invented a game followed by millions, although I suspect its popularity is waning a bit in France after Sunday’s result. Congratulations to Italy. Personally, I prefer football. In fact I am proud to be a fan of Newcastle United. I am delighted to tell you that this month we have signed five new French players. I do not know whether your new 75% tax rate had anything to do with their enthusiasm to leave France and join Newcastle, but if it did, can I say on behalf of all Toon fans: ‘Merci beaucoup, Monsieur le President’. France’s loss is Newcastle’s gain. Mr President, I want to see a strong France helping to move Europe in a new direction. So far, the first few months of your Presidency have shown that socialism will deliver neither. ____ Mr. President, let me first congratulate you and your courageous armed forces for the current operation in Mali. Your troops, backed by British forces and those of other Member States, risk their lives to protect us and we owe them a lot. I hope everyone in this House will join me in saluting them. Mr. President, thank you for agreeing to come and discuss with us today in the beautiful and welcoming city that is Strasbourg ,. A city that should be seen at least once in his life. But perhaps not every month. You qualify for pro-European. But if you were really, you allow treaties to be changed so that Parliament can decide when and where it sits. A large majority of members of different nationalities, including some French deputies are in all political groups in favor of this reform (unlike some of their group leaders!) But, Mr. President, Strasbourg is not the main issue I want to address today. Indeed, I would rather to convey a simple message: thank you, Mr. President! Thank you for having brilliantly demonstrated to the rest of Europe what a socialist government like in practice. A government elected by promising to end the austerity and which then finds himself forced by economic reality to make severe budget cuts. I hope the British Labour Party and other socialist parties in Europe who defend their campaigns similar themes are attentive to what is happening. In my country, when the Socialists have left office, they left a note to the Ministry of Finance that said ""sorry, but there is more money."" Last week, your Minister of Labour and Employment has admitted that France was a failed state. Let's be clear, this is not great shape in other countries, but since you came to power, we have seen how devastating a socialist government could have on a country like France, both placed and talented Amen. When we look back, we see that it is the socialist governments - Spain, Britain, Portugal and Greece - which at the beginning of this crisis, have heated national credit card and that it is the Conservative and center-right who then repaired the damage. Mr. President, you have shown us the socialist future:  an increase of 75% taxes a lowering of the age of retirement to 60 years and, a reduction in working time to 35 hours a week.  This of course is attractive an electoral point of view but devastating to our international competition. Ronald Reagan said: ""If it moves, tax. If it keeps moving, Regulate and if it stops moving, give subsidies. "" Reagan joked, for sure; many socialists seem to see a kind of manifesto. If Europe is to prosper, it must change course. For socialists, ""single market"" means harmonize work rules, taxes and economic policies. For me, the ""single market"", is like being in an open space where everyone competes with others and where everyone becomes, in turn, more competitive on the international market. I raise this because many of you have suggested to me that David Cameron, when he gave his speech there two weeks demanding an unfair competitive advantage. This is simply not the case. Mr. Cameron wants a reform for the whole of Europe - a single market where a country  can have lower taxes - such as Ireland, can have more flexible labor standards - such as Britain, may have favorable policies to the industry - such as Germany and the new Member States,  while remaining a full member of the single market. It's time to talk again of the competition in Europe. Mr. President, your Foreign Minister likened this approach to the attitude of someone who registers a football club while wanting to play rugby. That said, Mr Fabius was right at the time when he opposed the draft European Constitution and I think it was again due today. In fact, I do not think he was aware at that time, the fineness of his analogy. For it is precisely on a football field that rugby was invented. There is no doubt that the player who, at the time, picked up the ball and was incurred with, had to endure the taunts and cries of his teammates. Of course, we now know that he invented a sport that is now followed by millions of people, though I suspect that his popularity has dropped a little in the announcement of results of last Sunday's game in France . Personally, I prefer football. In reality, I am a supporter of Newcastle United and, moreover, our team has hired five French players last month. I do not know if your new 75% tax project has a link with the enthusiasm with which they left France and joined the team of Newcastle, but if that is the case, I can tell you, on behalf of all supporters of the Toon: thank you very much Mr. President! Mr. President, I would like to see a strong France which help Europe to move forward in a new direction. So far, the early months of your presidency have shown that socialism is no help.       ",mr presid may start join group leader pay tribut brave arm forc current oper mali troop aid british member

</p><p>____</p><p>
</p><p>Monsieur le Président, laissez-moi tout d’abord vous féliciter ainsi que vos courageuses forces armées pour l’opération en cours au Mali. Vos troupes, appuyées par les forces britanniques et celles d’autres États membres, risquent leurs vies pour nous protéger et nous leur devons beaucoup. J’espère que chacun dans cette Assemblée se joindra à moi pour leur rendre hommage.</p><p>
</p><p>Monsieur le Président, merci d’avoir accepté de venir débattre avec nous aujourd’hui dans la ville magnifique et accueillante qu’est Strasbourg,. Une ville qu’il faudrait avoir vue au moins une fois dans sa vie. Mais peut-être pas chaque mois.</p><p>
</p><p>Vous vous qualifiez de pro-européen. Mais si vous l’étiez vraiment, vous permettriez que les traités soient modifiés de telle manière que le Parlement puisse décider où et quand il siège.</p><p>
</p><p>Une grande majorité de députés, de différentes nationalités, y compris certains députés français, sont, dans tous les groupes politiques, en faveur de cette réforme (contrairement à certains de leurs chefs de groupes!)</p><p>
</p><p>Mais, Monsieur le Président, Strasbourg n’est pas le principal sujet que je voudrais aborder aujourd’hui. En effet, je souhaite plutôt faire passer un message simple: merci, Monsieur le Président! Merci d’avoir brillamment démontré au reste de l’Europe ce à quoi un gouvernement socialiste ressemble dans la pratique. Un gouvernement élu en promettant de mettre fin à l’austérité et, qui se trouve ensuite acculé par la réalité économique à pratiquer des coupes budgétaires sévères.</p><p>
</p><p>J’espère que le Parti travailliste britannique et tous les autres partis socialistes d’Europe qui défendent dans leurs campagnes des thèmes similaires, sont bien attentifs à ce qui se passe.</p><p>
</p><p>Dans mon pays, quand les socialistes ont quitté le pouvoir, ils ont laissé une note au ministère des finances qui disait: “désolés, mais il n’y a plus d’argent”. La semaine dernière, votre ministre du travail et de l’emploi a admis que la France était un État en faillite.</p><p>
</p><p>Soyons clair, ce n’est pas non plus la grande forme dans les autres pays, mais depuis que vous êtes arrivé au pouvoir, nous avons vu quel effet dévastateur un gouvernement socialiste pouvait avoir sur un pays comme la France, aussi bien placé et talentueux soit-il.</p><p>
</p><p>Quand nous regardons en arrière, nous constatons que ce sont les gouvernements socialistes – en Espagne, en Grande-Bretagne, au Portugal et en Grèce – qui, au début de cette crise, ont fait chauffer les cartes de crédit nationales et que ce sont les partis conservateurs et de centre-droite qui ont ensuite réparé les dégâts.</p><p>
</p><p>Monsieur le Président, vous nous avez montré l’avenir socialiste:</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>une augmentation des taxes à 75 %,</p><p>
</p><p>un abaissement de l’âge du départ à la retraite à 60 ans et,</p><p>
</p><p>une réduction du temps de travail à 35 heures semaines.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Cela est bien sûr attrayant d’un point de vue électoral mais dévastateur pour notre concurrence internationale.</p><p>
</p><p>Ronald Reagan déclarait: “Si ça bouge, taxez. Si ça continue à bouger, régulez et si ça s’arrête de bouger, donnez des subventions”. Reagan plaisantait, c’est certain; de nombreux socialistes semblent voir là une sorte de manifeste.</p><p>
</p><p>Si l’Europe doit prospérer, il faut la faire changer de cap. Pour les socialistes, “marché unique” veut dire harmonisation des règles de travail, des taxes et des politiques économiques.</p><p>
</p><p>Pour moi, le “marché unique”, c’est se retrouver dans un espace ouvert où chacun entre en compétition avec les autres et où chacun devient, à tour de rôle, plus compétitif sur le marché international.</p><p>
</p><p>Je soulève cette question parce que nombre d’entre vous m’ont laissé entendre que David Cameron, quand il a prononcé son discours il y a deux semaines, réclamait un avantage concurrentiel indu. Ce n’est tout simplement pas le cas. Monsieur Cameron souhaite une réforme pour l’ensemble de l’Europe – un marché unique où un pays</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>peut avoir des taxes moins élevées – comme l’Irlande,</p><p>
</p><p>peut avoir des normes de travail plus flexibles – comme la Grande-Bretagne,</p><p>
</p><p>peut avoir des politiques favorables à l’industrie – comme l’Allemagne ou les nouveaux États membres,</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>mais tout en restant membre à part entière du marché unique. Il est temps de reparler à nouveau de la compétition en Europe.</p><p>
</p><p>Monsieur le Président, votre ministre des affaires étrangères a comparé cette approche à l’attitude de quelqu’un qui s’inscrit à un club de football tout en voulant jouer au rugby.</p><p>
</p><p>Ceci dit, M. Fabius avait raison, à l’époque, quand il s’est opposé au projet de Constitution européenne et je pense qu’il a de nouveau raison aujourd’hui. En fait, je ne pense pas qu’il se soit rendu compte, à ce moment-là, de la finesse de son analogie.</p><p>
</p><p>Car c’est précisément sur un terrain de football que le rugby aurait été inventé. Il ne fait aucun doute que le joueur qui, à cette époque, a ramassé la balle puis s’est encouru avec, a dû subir les railleries et les cris de ses coéquipiers.</p><p>
</p><p>Bien sûr, nous savons aujourd’hui qu’il a inventé un sport qui est désormais suivi par des millions de gens, bien que je suspecte que sa popularité ait un peu baissé à l’annonce des résultats du match de dimanche dernier, en France.</p><p>
</p><p>Personnellement, je préfère le football. En réalité, je suis un supporter de Newcastle United et, d’ailleurs, notre équipe vient d’engager cinq joueurs français le mois dernier. Je ne sais pas si votre nouveau projet de taxe à 75 % a un lien avec l’enthousiasme avec lequel ils ont quitté la France et rejoint l’équipe de Newcastle mais, si tel est le cas, je peux vous dire, au nom de tous les supporters du Toon: merci beaucoup Monsieur le Président!</p><p>
</p><p>Monsieur le Président, je souhaiterais voir une France forte qui aide l’Europe à avancer dans une nouvelle direction. Jusqu’à présent, les premiers mois de votre présidence ont montré que le socialisme n’y contribuerait pas.</p><p>
</p><p> </p><p>
